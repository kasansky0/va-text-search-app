REMANDED

The claim of service connection for a left hip disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2008 to April 2009.

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a November 2023 rating decision.  In January 2024, VA issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior November 2023 rating decision.  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after VA issued the November 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by VA in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The claim of service connection for a left hip disability is remanded.

The claim of service connection for a left hip disability is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the November 2023 rating decision. 

VA obtained a medical opinion in October 2022.  While the examiner opined that the Veteran's current left hip strain was less likely than not related to in-service treatment for left hip psoas tendinitis, the opinion appears to be based on a lack of treatment since service and does not adequately consider the Veteran's competent lay statement regarding onset of left hip pain during service that had continued and progressively worsened since service.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the Veteran's left hip condition.  The examiner must review the claims file.  An in-person examination is not required unless deemed so by the examiner. 

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's left hip disability (1) began during, or is otherwise related to, active service, (2) manifested within one year after discharge from service, or (3) was noted during service with continuity of the same symptomatology since service? 

Provide a rationale to support the opinion(s).  In doing so, the examiner should consider the Veteran's lay statement regarding the rigors of service and service treatment records noting left hip psoas tendinitis from November 2008 through February 2009.  In providing the requested opinion, consider the Veteran's description of the in-service injury and symptoms as well as post-service symptoms.  If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that the Veteran's reported injury and symptoms in service and thereafter represented the onset of the current disability, this should be noted.  Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about the symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?
