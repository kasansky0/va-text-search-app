REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1986 to February 1989.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the August 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. From May 12, 2020 to November 6, 2022, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee limitation of extension

The Veteran contends she is entitled to a higher rating for her right knee limitation of extension.

From May 12, 2020 to November 6, 2022, the Veteran's right knee limitation of extension was rated 10 percent disabling under DC 5003-5261.

From November 7, 2022, the Veteran was in receipt of a 100 percent rating for the right knee due to a total knee replacement.  This is the highest rating available; therefore, from November 7, 2022 to January 30, 2023, entitlement to a higher rating is not warranted.

During the pendency of the appeal, the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, including Diagnostic Code 5003 was amended effective February 7, 2021.  85 Fed. Reg. 76453 (Nov. 30, 2020).  Prior to February 7, 2021, the Board will consider the old version of the diagnostic code only; however, for the period beginning February 7, 2021, the Board will consider both the old and amended version of the diagnostic code and rate based on whichever is most favorable to the Veteran.

Under the old criteria, when there is no limitation of motion of the specific joint or joints that involve degenerative arthritis, Diagnostic Code 5003 provides a 10 percent rating for degenerative arthritis with X-ray evidence of involvement of 2 or more major joints or 2 or more minor joint groups.  

Under the new criteria, the only change to Diagnostic Code 5003 is a change in the title to the code, indicating that the criteria apply to all types of degenerative arthritis other than post-traumatic.

The February 2021 amendments did not affect Diagnostic Code 5261, limitation of extension.  Diagnostic Code 5261 provides that extension of the leg limited to 15 degrees is rated 20 percent disabling.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2021.  The Veteran did not report flare-ups.  The Veteran's flexion was noted to be limited to 90 degrees with extension limited to 5 degrees.  During repeated use over time, the Veteran's flexion was limited to 85 degrees with extension limited to 10 degrees.  The examiner noted that pain and lack of endurance caused functional loss.

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in October 2022.  The Veteran did not report flare-ups.  The Veteran reported her right knee would lock up at times.  The Veteran's flexion was noted to be limited to 95 degrees and extension was limited to 0 degrees.  No ankylosis was noted.  

The Board has reviewed the evidence of record and finds that from May 12, 2020 to November 6, 2022, the Veteran is not entitled to a rating in excess of 10 percent for her right knee limitation of extension.

From May 12, 2020 to November 6, 2022, a higher rating is not warranted as the evidence of record does not show right knee extension limited to 15 degrees.

The Board has also considered whether separate ratings are warranted under Diagnostic Code (DC) 5260 for limitation of flexion; DC 5256 for ankylosis; DC 5257 for recurrent subluxation or lateral instability; DC 5258 or 5259 for a meniscal condition; or under DC 5262 and 5263 for impairments of the tibia or fibula, or genu recurvatum.  However, there is no evidence that the Veteran's right knee flexion is limited to 45 degrees or greater; ankylosis; recurrent subluxation, or lateral instability of the right knee; a meniscal condition; and there is no evidence of impairments of the tibia or fibula, or genu recurvatum.  Therefore, separate ratings for the Veteran's right knee disability under DC 5260, DC 5256, DC 5257, DC5258, DC 5259, DC 5262, and DC 5263 are not warranted. 

Therefore, from May 12, 2020 to November 6, 2022, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee limitation of extension is denied.

2. From May 12, 2020 to January 30, 2023, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee instability 

The Veteran contends she is entitled to a higher rating for her left knee instability.

From May 12, 2020 to January 30, 2023, the Veteran's left knee was rated 10 percent disabling under DC 5003-5257.

Separate disability ratings are possible for arthritis with limitation of motion under Diagnostic Codes 5003 and instability of a knee under Diagnostic Code 5257.  See VAOPGCPREC 23-97.  When X-ray findings of arthritis are present and a veteran's knee disability is rated under Diagnostic Code 5257, the veteran would be entitled to a separate compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5003 if the arthritis results in noncompensable limitation of motion and/or objective findings or indicators of pain.  See VAOPGCPREC 9-98.

During the pendency of the appeal, the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, was amended effective February 7, 2021.  85 Fed. Reg. 76453 (Nov. 30, 2020).  Prior to February 7, 2021, the Board will consider the old version of the diagnostic code only; however, for the period beginning February 7, 2021, the Board will consider both the old and amended version of the diagnostic code and rate based on whichever is most favorable to the Veteran.

Under the old criteria, 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257, a 20 percent rating is assignable for moderate recurrent subluxation or moderate lateral instability.

As of February 7, 2021, under the amended version of Diagnostic Code 5257, criteria for recurrent subluxation or lateral instability have been changed as the following: If one of the following is met, 20 percent is assigned: (a) sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation, or (b) unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. 

In addition, the amended version of Diagnostic Code 5257 now includes new criteria for "patellar instability." A diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: A brace, cane, or walker is rated as 20 percent. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2021.  The Veteran did not report flare-ups.  The examiner indicated the Veteran did not have a history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the left knee.  The Veteran did also not have patellar instability of the left knee.

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in October 2022.  The Veteran did not report flare-ups.  The Veteran reported a history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the left knee as she stated her left knee would lock up at times.  No patellar instability was noted, however persistent instability was noted.  The Veteran did have a left meniscal tear that resulted in surgery with residuals of pain and instability.  

The Board has reviewed the evidence of record and finds that from May 12, 2020 to January 30, 2023, the Veteran is not entitled to a rating in excess of 10 percent for her left knee instability.

A higher rating is not warranted as the evidence of record does not show moderate left knee instability; patellar instability; or that a medical provider has prescribed a brace and/or assistive device for ambulation or bracing for ambulation. 

Therefore, from May 12, 2020 to January 30, 2023, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee instability is denied.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee semilunar cartilage removal 

The Veteran seeks a rating in excess of 10 percent for her left knee semilunar cartilage removal.

Under Diagnostic Code 5259, removal of the semilunar cartilage when symptomatic warranted a 10 percent rating.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for disabilities of the knee and leg; however, DC 5259 was unchanged.

As the Veteran is in receipt of the highest schedular rating for dislocation of symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage, there is no basis to award a higher evaluation.

Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee semilunar cartilage removal.

4. From May 12, 2020 to October 30, 2022, entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for left knee limitation of extension 

From May 12, 2020 to October 30, 2022, the Veteran seeks a rating in excess of 20 percent for her left knee limitation of extension. 

The Veteran's left knee limitation of extension is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261, for limitation of extension of the leg.  Under Diagnostic Code 5261, a 30 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 20 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for disabilities of the knee and leg; however, DC 5261 was unchanged.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2021.  The Veteran did not report flare-ups.  Her extension of the left knee was noted to be limited to 10 degrees, and after repeated use was limited to 15 degrees.

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that from May 12, 2020 to October 30, 2022, a rating in excess of 20 percent for left knee limitation of extension is not warranted. 

From May 12, 2020 to October 30, 2022, a higher rating is not warranted as the evidence does not show that the Veteran's left knee extension was limited to 20 degrees.

Therefore, from May 12, 2020 to October 30, 2022, entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for left knee limitation of extension is denied.

5. From October 31, 2022 to January 30, 2023, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee limitation of extension 

From October 31, 2022 to January 30, 2023, the Veteran seeks a rating in excess of 10 percent for her left knee limitation of extension. 

As an initial matter, after the rating decision on appeal, the AOJ reduced the Veteran's left knee limitation of extension rating to 10 percent disabling beginning on October 31, 2022.  See March 2023 Rating Decision.

The Veteran's left knee limitation of extension is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261, for limitation of extension of the leg.  Under Diagnostic Code 5261, if extension of the leg was limited to 15 degrees, a 20 percent rating is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for disabilities of the knee and leg; however, DC 5261 was unchanged.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2022.  The Veteran did not report flare-ups.  Her extension of the left knee was noted to be limited to 0 degrees, and after repeated use was limited to 0 degrees.

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that from October 31, 2022 to January 30, 2023, a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee limitation of extension is not warranted. 

From October 31, 2022 to January 30, 2023, a higher rating is not warranted as the evidence does not show that the Veteran's left knee extension was limited to 15 degrees.

Therefore, from October 31, 2022 to January 30, 2023, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee limitation of extension is denied.

6. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 12, 2020, for the grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU)

The Veteran originally was seeking entitlement to a TDIU.  However, she was granted entitlement to a TDIU effective May 12, 2020 (the date of claim).

Under Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), a claim for a TDIU is part and parcel of any open rating issue (initial or increased) when unemployability is expressly raised by a veteran or reasonably raised by the record during the rating appeal, and it attaches for the entire rating period.  Here, the Veteran's increased rating claims for her right and left knee disabilities are sufficient for TDIU to be part and parcel of these claims as the Veteran has expressly raised the issue of unemployability.

A VA Form 21-8940 was filed on May 12, 2020, in which the Veteran reported she became too disabled to work on September 29, 2019.  

The issue before the Board, then, is whether a Rice TDIU provides a possible earlier effective date.

Next, because the effective date for an increased rating (including a TDIU) can be up to one-year prior to receipt by the RO of the claim, the question for the Board to consider is whether there is a factually ascertainable worsening of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities in the one-year period prior to May 12, 2020, such that she met the criteria for a TDIU during that time.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); VAOPGCPREC 12-98.

Entitlement to a TDIU requires the presence of impairment so severe that it is impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  Consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his or her age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.  In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability."  Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).  The fact that a Veteran is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough to warrant a TDIU.  See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).

From May 12, 2019 to May 12, 2020, the Veteran was service connected for the following disabilities:

Left knee instability, rated as 10 percent disabling;

Hysterectomy, rated as 50 percent disabling; 

Right knee limitation of flexion, rated as 10 percent disabling; 

Left knee limitation of flexion, rated as 10 percent disabling; 

Left knee semilunar cartilage removal, rated as 10 percent disabling; 

Tinnitus, rated as 10 percent disabling; 

TMJ, rated as 10 percent disabling; and

Left knee limitation of extension, rated as 10 percent disabling.

The Veteran meets the schedular criteria for a TDIU May 12, 2019, one-year prior to the filing of the claim for TDIU on May 12, 2020.

The next question for the Board to consider is when, if ever, in the one-year period prior to May 12, 2020, does the record show the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered her incapable of substantial gainful employment due to her service-connected disorders.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

With the above laws and regulations in mind, the Board notes that the Veteran reported last working in September 2019 as a nurse due to her service-connected knees and a non-service connected back disability. See VA Form 21-8940. 

September 2019 VA treatment records show the Veteran reported that she had gone back to work for three days but then tripped on oxygen tubing and hurt her foot again.  

September 2019 private treatment records show that the Veteran was seen following a September 20, 2019, injury after tripping over oxygen tubing.  She fell forward on both knees, hurting the right more than the left.  She also hurt her lumbar spine and lower flank area and contused the left foot that had been a recent problem.  The Veteran reported pain across the base of her spine with spasms and the Veteran "walks with a terrible antalgic gait pattern." Also pain in both knees with weakness in the quads and palpable crepitus in the patellofemoral joint and medial compartment of both knees.  Her spine x-ray showed degenerative changes, especially of the L5-S1 disc space.  The knee x-rays showed advanced degenerative arthritis with some medial compartment narrowing and patellofemoral spurring across both knees.  The Veteran was told Veteran to avoid stairs, squatting, and kneeling.

Dr. K.M.. also noted that the Veteran had previously injured her left foot and had been released back to work on September 16, 2019.  She complained of pain across the knees and shooting pain across back and left flank, going down into the right leg.  She reported a complicated history of multiple work injuries over the years, including at a hospital in 1989 and 1991, at a VA hospital, at a prison, and in multiple group homes.  She left the group home position in October 2018, took some time off for personal reasons, and then worked for the state Veterans' Home just prior to this injury. The clinician found the left foot issue was the probable cause of the Veteran's fall and noted that she was a high fall risk as a result of this left foot issue.

October 2019 private treatment records show that the Veteran was still out of work but had not received her worker's compensation benefits.  Her knees, back, and left foot were still a problem, she avoided a lot of stairs, squatting, and kneeling.  She had trouble walking any type of distance, walked with a limp, and was a fall risk. The clinician felt she should be using a cane.

November 2019 private treatment records show that she continued to be out of work but was awarded worker's compensation benefits because of her September 20, 2019, injury.  She was still out of work on worker's compensation in December 2019.  Dr. K.M. found she could not return to work prior to January 6, 2020.

Private treatment records from September to December 2019 note the Veteran continued to have foot pain during ambulation, walking, and at rest.

In January 2020, the private clinician stated that she was unable to work because of a work injury.  A January 2020 note from Dr. K.M. stated that she could not return to work from January 21, 2020, through February 4, 2020.

January 2020 VA treatment records show that the Veteran had still not had her planned knee surgeries, but that she was walking with a boot due to having broken her left foot three months prior, tripping over oxygen tubing.  She had stopped working but did not like sitting around.  She stated that she wanted to wait as long as possible to have the knee surgeries.

February and March 2020 private treatment records note the Veteran suffered a plantar plate injury of the left second toe.  She had continued soreness on the bottom of her foot.  The Veteran reported she had to wear a pad under her foot which helped the pain but did not eliminate it, and the pain interferes with her walking.

In February 2020, private Dr. K.M. opined that the Veteran was unable to go back to her job working as a nurse.  The Veteran still had back pain across the back and buttock and spams, the pain radiated down both legs, she had an antalgic gait pattern, and had pain across both knees medially.  She also had pain across the left foot.  Dr. K.M. found she could not return to work prior to February 17, 2020.

In March 2020, private records from Dr. K.M. continued to find the Veteran was a high fall risk and had to be careful and avoid stairs and squatting as much as possible.  She was unable to do her normal job and work in the interim.  Dr. K.M. stated that the Veteran could not return to work prior to her next appointment on March 16, 2020.

In April 2020 VA treatment records, the Veteran requested the completion of retirement paperwork due to her recent fall at work.  She stated that she fell on September 29, 2019, and injured her back and both knees and tore a ligament in her left great toe.  She stated that she was forced to retire because of the risk of further injury if she returned to work.  She stated that she was placed on IOD status by a state municipal judge and was receiving only 80 percent of her salary.

In May 2020 VA treatment records, the Veteran noted she wanted to retire due to the injury she sustained at work in September 2019.

The Board has reviewed the evidence of record and finds the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date earlier than May 12, 2020, for the grant of TDIU.

An earlier effective date is not warranted as it is not factually ascertainable that prior to May 12, 2020, the Veteran was unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment due to her service-connected disabilities.  Instead, the Board finds that the Veteran was unable to work predominantly due to her non-service-connected foot, back, hand, and flank disabilities.  Both the Veteran's statement that she had to retire due to her work injury and Dr. K.M.'s statement that the Veteran was unable to work due to her work injury of tripping over an oxygen tube due to a non-service-connected foot disability are highly probative evidence against the Veteran's claim.

Therefore, entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 12, 2020, for the grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), is denied.

In reaching the above conclusions the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the claim that doctrine is not applicable in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
