FINDING OF FACT

During a February 2025 hearing, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran on the record have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1971 to October 1975.  These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from December 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  Thereafter, the Veteran perfected an appeal in the Appeals Modernization Act system by submitting a February 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  Therein, the Veteran selected the hearing docket.

The Veteran was provided the requested Board hearing in February 2025; the transcript has been associated with the claims file.  During the hearing, the Veteran and his representative requested to withdraw the appeal as to the issues of entitlement to service connection for COPD, sinusitis, and rhinitis.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  

An oral withdrawal of an appeal, such as one made at a hearing, must be (1) explicit, (2) unambiguous, and (3) done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action on the part of the claimant.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011); see Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (the Board must address all three prongs of the DeLisio standard when it applies).]

In the present case, during the February 2025 hearing, the Veteran explicitly and unambiguously requested to withdraw this appeal.  Specifically, during a pre-hearing conference, both the Veteran and his representative indicated that they wished to withdraw the appeal.  This indication was memorialized by the Veterans Law Judge in the hearing transcript.  Moreover, the undersigned Veterans Law Judge specifically asked the Veteran if he understood that, if he were to withdraw the appeal, she would not have jurisdiction for appellate consideration; the Veteran affirmatively responded.  Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the claims of entitlement to service connection for COPD, sinusitis, and rhinitis and they are dismissed.
