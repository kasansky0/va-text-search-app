REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from September 2001 to June 2022. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

All evidence prior to the rating decision at issue was considered, including the April 19, 2023, Disability Benefits Questionnaires submitted by the Veteran. See Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) - Veteran Provided (August 2023). If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

When a Veteran, without showing good cause, fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with a claim for an increased rating, the claim shall be denied. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

1. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome. 

2. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome. 

3. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for lumbosacral strain.

The Veteran seeks an increased evaluation for his bilateral knee patellofemoral pain syndrome as well as his lumbosacral strain. See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (August 2023).

After requesting an increased evaluation for his knee and back disorders, VA scheduled an examination for the Veteran in order to corroborate examination findings he submitted. See Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) - Veteran Provided (August 2023). 

The Veteran was informed of these examinations but contacted VA to report he would not attend. See VA 27-0820 Report of General Information (September 2023); see also Correspondence (September 2023). The Veteran did not provide a reason for missing the examinations. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's claims for increased ratings must be denied given his failure to appear at the scheduled VA examinations. Subsequently, no statement has been submitted by the Veteran or on behalf of the Veteran advancing good cause for the Veteran's failure to appear for the VA examinations. While the claims file does not include a copy of the letter or letters notifying the Veteran of the date of his scheduled VA examinations, this fact alone does not constitute good cause for failure to report. See Kyhn v. Shinseki, 716 F.3d 572 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Given the above, the Board finds that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b) apply to the Veteran's increased rating claims on appeal and that the Veteran's claims must be denied.
