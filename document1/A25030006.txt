ORDER

An initial compensable rating for hearing loss is denied.

An initial compensable rating for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is denied.

REMANDED

Service connection for dizziness as secondary to hearing loss is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. During the rating period on appeal, the Veteran's hearing loss manifested in hearing acuity of no worse than Level I in his better ear and Level V in his worse ear.

2. During the rating period on appeal, the Veteran's CLL was asymptomatic at Rai Stage 0.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for hearing loss are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100.

2. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for CLL are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.117, Diagnostic Code 7703.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1966 to May 1968, in the United States Army.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from September 2024 and October 2024 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The September 2024 rating decision was a higher-level review rating decision issued in response to the Veteran's request for higher level review of an August 2024 rating decision. In November 2024, the Veteran timely filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, electing the Direct Review docket. 

Given this procedural history, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the applicable rating decision. See 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. If any evidence was submitted after the August 2024 rating decision for the hearing loss or CLL claims or the October 2024 rating decision for the liver cirrhosis claim, it was not considered. If the Veteran would like any such evidence regarding his claims for increased ratings for hearing loss and CLL to be considered, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Regarding the Veteran's claim for service connection for liver cirrhosis, as that claim is being remanded, any such evidence will be considered by the RO on remand.

Disability ratings

Disability ratings are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability and are determined by comparing the symptomatology to the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Different ratings may be assigned for different periods of time for the same disorder if the facts show distinct time periods with different levels of disability. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

1. An initial compensable rating for hearing loss

Service connection was established for bilateral hearing loss in a March 2024 rating decision. A noncompensable rating was assigned pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100. The Veteran contends that a compensable initial rating is warranted.

The assignment of disability ratings for hearing impairment is derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule to numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are rendered. See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992). Evaluations of hearing loss range from noncompensable (zero percent) to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

To evaluate the degree of disability for bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the rating schedule establishes eleven auditory acuity levels, designated from Level I for essentially normal acuity, through Level XI for profound deafness. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII, Diagnostic Code 6100. The rating criteria also provide for rating exceptional patterns of hearing impairment when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz is 55 decibels or more, or when the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86. In such cases, each ear is considered separately, and the Roman numeral designation for the ear with an exceptional pattern of hearing impairment is derived from Table VI or VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral. Id.

An examination for hearing loss must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include both a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC test) and a pure tone audiometry test. Examinations must be conducted without the use of hearing aids. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85. 

The Veteran underwent two VA audiological examinations during the period on appeal. 

During the first VA examination, conducted in December 2023, audiometric testing revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

HERTZ

1000 2000 3000 4000 Avg

RIGHT 20 25 40 60 36.25

LEFT 25 60 80 100 66.25

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 94 percent in both ears.

Applying these results to Table VI, a numeric designation of Level I in the right ear and Level II in the left ear is obtained. Where hearing loss is at Level I in the better ear and Level II in the worse ear, Table VII assigns a 0 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VI, VII.

During the August 2024 VA examination, audiometric testing revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

HERTZ

1000 2000 3000 4000 Avg

RIGHT 25 25 30 55 33.75

LEFT 25 60 75 80 60

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in the right ear and 74 percent in the left ear.

These results from the August 2024 audiological evaluation correspond to Level I in the right ear and Level V in the left ear under Table VI, and again merit the assignment of a 0 percent rating under Table VII. Id.

Accordingly, the probative evidence of record reflects that the Veteran's hearing loss is not of such severity to warrant a compensable rating under the rating criteria. The Board has considered whether 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a) and (b) apply to this case. Application of 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a) is not warranted, as neither the right nor left ear displayed pure tone thresholds at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hertz) of 55 decibels or more. Nor is application of 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b) warranted as the pure tone thresholds were not 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran has reported difficulty understanding speech in everyday situations-in quiet, in noise, on the television, and on the telephone. See Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447, 455 (2007) (noting that a VA audiologist must include the functional effects of a Veteran's hearing loss disability in the examination report). The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that the rating criteria for hearing loss contemplate the functional effects of decreased hearing and difficulty understanding speech in everyday environments as these are the effects that VA's audiometric tests are designed to measure. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369 (2017). 

Apart from the VA examinations, no other audiometric testing has been associated with the Veterans' claims file. As discussed above, neither VA examination produced results indicating that an initial compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss warranted a noncompensable (zero percent) rating during the entire rating period on appeal. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and the claim is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Lastly, the Board notes that it finds that a claim for dizziness as secondary to hearing loss was reasonably raised by the record at the time of the rating decision on appeal. See Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021) (holding that if a secondary service connection claim is reasonably raised by the record in the context of an increased rating claim, a separate formal claim for service connection is not required); 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2) (providing that VA will consider "entitlement to any additional benefits for complications of the claimed condition"). The Board will address this claim in the remand section below. 

2. An initial compensable rating for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)

Service connection was established for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in a June 2024 rating decision. A noncompensable rating was assigned pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7703. The Veteran contends that a compensable initial rating is warranted.

Leukemia (other than chronic myelogenous leukemia) is rated under Diagnostic Code 7703. A 100 percent rating is assigned when there is active disease or during a treatment phase; otherwise, leukemia is to be rated based on residuals under the appropriate diagnostic code. CLL that is asymptomatic, Rai Stage 0, is to be assigned a 0 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.117. Symptomatic CLL that is at Rai Stage I, II, III, or IV is to be evaluated the same as any other leukemia under this diagnostic code. Note (2) to Diagnostic Code 7703.

Turning to the evidence of record, at an April 2024 VA examination, the Veteran's CLL was noted to be asymptomatic, Rai Stage 0. The examiner noted that the Veteran was not undergoing treatment for CLL at that time.

In August 2024, the Veteran presented for another VA examination. It was noted that his CLL was asymptomatic, Rai Stage 0, and that the Veteran was undergoing no treatment for the condition.

Based on consideration of the foregoing, the Board finds that a compensable rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 7703 during the period on appeal. At both VA examinations obtained during the period on appeal, the examiners specifically indicated that the Veteran's condition was asymptomatic and at Rai Stage 0. No other evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's CLL was symptomatic or had advanced to a higher Rai Stage.

Given the above, the criteria for an initial compensable rating for CLL are not met. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and the claim is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for dizziness as secondary to hearing loss

Upon review of the record on appeal, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error occurred and remand of the Veteran's claim is needed. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The Board notes that "VA is required to develop and adjudicate related claims for secondary service connection for disabilities that are reasonably raised during the adjudication of a formally initiated claim for the proper evaluation level for the primary service-connected disability." Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. at 203.

Prior to the September 2024 rating decision on appeal, the evidence of record contained a December 2012 letter from the Veteran's treating doctor S.L. discussing the Veteran's symptoms of dizziness and recommending an audiometric evaluation. 

This evidence indicates a possible association between the Veteran's service-connected hearing loss and his dizziness. Accordingly, the Board finds that a claim for secondary service connection for dizziness has been reasonably raised during the course of the Veteran's claim for a higher initial rating for his hearing loss. 

While the RO obtained an opinion regarding whether the Veteran's dizziness is related to his in-service exposure to Agent Orange, the RO did not obtain an opinion regarding whether the Veteran's dizziness is secondary to his service-connected hearing loss. 

As there was evidence before the RO that indicated a possible association between the Veteran's dizziness and his hearing loss but the RO did not obtain a medical opinion regarding whether secondary service connection is warranted, remand is necessary to correct this duty to assist error. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

2. Service connection for liver cirrhosis

Upon review of the record on appeal, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error occurred and remand of the Veteran's claim is needed. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Prior to the October 2024 rating decision on appeal, a medical opinion was obtained regarding whether the Veteran's liver cirrhosis is secondary to his service-connected diabetes mellitus. The examiner opined that the Veteran's liver cirrhosis was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of his diabetes mellitus, noting that the "development of cirrhosis usually involves multiple risk factors, including chronic alcohol use, viral hepatitis, and other liver insults." In the opinion, the examiner repeatedly mentions alcohol use as a more important causative factor than diabetes mellitus. The problem with this is that the record indicates that the Veteran does not drink alcohol. 

Also problematic, the examiner notes that "DMII may contribute to liver disease through the development of NAFLD or NASH ..." At the Veteran's August 2024 liver conditions examination, the examiner indicated that the Veteran's liver cirrhosis was secondary to NASH. Yet, in the secondary service connection opinion, while the examiner notes a possible connection between diabetes mellitus and NASH, the examiner does not discuss the Veteran having NASH. 

In sum, the August 2024 secondary service connection opinion is inadequate as the rationale is not specific to the Veteran and is inconsistent with the facts of the Veteran's case. Accordingly, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error has occurred and remand is warranted in order to obtain an adequate opinion regarding whether the Veteran's liver cirrhosis was caused or aggravated by his diabetes mellitus. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (holding that when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate).

As the Veteran's claim cannot be granted under any raised theory of entitlement based on the current evidence of record, remand to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error is necessary. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a medical opinion regarding whether the Veteran's dizziness is caused or aggravated by his hearing loss.
