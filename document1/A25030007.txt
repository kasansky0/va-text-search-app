DOCKET NO. 210330-149395
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issues of entitlement to service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral knee arthritis and right elbow arthritis is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 5, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant or his authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United Sates Army from August 1985 to August 2005. This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2021 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

By way of history, the Veteran's claims of service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, left knee arthritis and right elbow arthritis were originally denied in an April 2009 rating decision, while the claim of service connection for right knee arthritis was originally denied in a June 2009 rating decision. These claims were unappealed. 

In September 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claims of service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, left knee arthritis and right elbow arthritis, most recently addressed in an April 2009 rating decision, and service connection for right knee arthritis, most recently addressed in a June 2009 rating decision. 

In March 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. In the March 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran filed a timely appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals (The Board) and elected the Hearing docket. 

On March 5, 2025, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request. Therefore, the appeal is now properly before the Board. The Board finds that the Veteran has withdrawn his appeal for service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral knee arthritis and right elbow arthritis, in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 20.205, and the claims must be dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  In the present case, the appellant, through his authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. 

In Hembree v. Wilkie, the Court held that where a written "withdrawal includes the name of the appellant and the file number and unambiguously identifies the claims to be withdrawn, then the written withdrawal will be considered valid and the Board need not look to other evidence to find it so." Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2020). The March 5, 2025 statement from the Veteran's representative meets this criteria and is considered a valid withdrawal.

 Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
