ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensation for warts, bilateral hands is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's bilateral hand warts is not manifested by scars or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck; does not affect at least 5 percent of her entire body or of exposed areas; and has not required intermittent or longer systemic therapy.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable rating for service-connected warts, bilateral hands, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, DCs 7899-7819, 7820.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Veteran served on active duty in the Air Force from October 2010 to September 2014, with subsequent service in the Air Force Reserves.

In the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations. 38 C.F.R. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 3.321, 4.1.

VA should interpret reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability shall be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations to apply, the higher of the two should be assigned where the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

Entitlement to an initial compensation for warts, bilateral hands is denied.

The Veteran is seeking a compensable rating for his service connected warts on his bilateral hands.  The Veteran's bilateral hand warts are currently assigned a 0 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7899-7819.

Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the specific basis for the evaluation assigned. The additional code is shown after a hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. In addition, codes ending in "99" are for all unlisted conditions. Here, the use of the Diagnostic Code 7899-7819 refers to a skin disability not specifically listed in the rating criteria which is rated analogous to a disability due to dermatitis or eczema. When an unlisted condition is encountered, it is permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology, are closely analogous. 38 C.F.R. § 4.20.  

Diagnostic Code 7819 for benign skin neoplasms directs those disabilities evaluated under this Diagnostic Code be rated as disfigurement of head, face, or neck (Diagnostic Code 7800), scars (Diagnostic Codes 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), or impairment of function.

The Veteran was afforded a VA skin disability questionnaire examination in September 2022.  During the examination, the Veteran provided a history of recurrent episodes of recalcitrant warts both hands that started in 2012. He currently experienced recalcitrant growth of warts in both hands.  The examiner noted that a review of the Veteran's service treatment record showed that he was evaluated on multiple visits for recalcitrant warts on both hands and discussions regarding cryotherapy treatments on November 29, 2012; June 5, 2013, June 12, 2014, July 24, 2014, and July 24, 2019.  In the past 12 months, the Veteran treated the condition with topical over-the-counter anti-wart liquid treatments for 6 weeks or more, but not constant.  He has not had any other treatments or procedures in the past 12 months.  On physical examination, the Veteran had multiple warts on both hands that was less than 5 percent of the total body area and less than 5 percent of the exposed area.  At the time of the examination, he did not have a skin condition that was without any visible characteristic lesions.  The multiple warts on both hands were described as verruca appearing lesions with two warts on the dorsum right thumb, one wart on the dorsum right index finger, and two warts on the dorsum left index finger.  There were no tumors or neoplasms.  The examiner reported that the Veteran's skin condition did not cause scarring and there were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, and/or symptoms related to the condition.  The skin condition did not impact his ability to work.   

In a February 25, 2025, Informal hearing Presentation, the Veteran's representative argued that the September 2022 VA examination was inadequate to assess the severity of the Veteran's warts.  More specifically, the representative asserted that as the Veteran's warts were not on his head, face, or neck, leaving his hand warts to be rated as either scars or impairment of function under Diagnostic Code 7819, the Veteran should have also been provided with a VA scar/disfigurement DBQ, which would assess pain or instability or a VA Hand and Finger DBQ that would correspond to impairment of function of the hand.  The representative stated that the VA skin condition DBQ did not contain questions about pain or instability or any functional loss or functional impairment of the joint or extremity.   

The Board has considered the representatives contentions, however, on the September 2022 VA skin DBQ, the examiner, reviewed the Veteran's medical records, provided a detailed discussion of the treatment and findings associated with his hand warts in his service, and physically examined the Veteran while eliciting a history of the present condition as well as current symptoms from the Veteran.  At no point throughout the appeal period has it either been alleged or shown that the Veteran experienced scars, instability, pain, or impairment of function of the hands or fingers.  The examiner specifically found no scars on physical examination, which would suggest that his hand warts would warrant a further scar examination.  Likewise, there were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, and/or symptoms related to the condition beyond the multiple warts that were located on his hands and fingers.  The skin condition did not impact his ability to work.   

Therefore, the Board finds that a compensable rating under 7899-7819 is not warranted.  Likewise, the General Rating Formula for the Skin also provides that skin disabilities may be rated as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (Diagnostic Code 7800) or scars (Diagnostic Codes 7801, 7802, 7804, 7805), depending upon the predominant disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. However, neither the clinical or lay evidence from the period on appeal shows that the Veteran's bilateral hand warts caused scarring or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck.  Consequently, Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, 7804, and 7805 do not apply.

The Board has considered if the Veteran is entitled to a compensable rating under another diagnostic Code. 

The General Rating Formula for the Skin also applies to Diagnostic Codes 7806 (dermatitis or eczema), 7809 (discoid lupus erythematosus), 7813 (dermatophytosis), 7815 (bullous disorders), 7816 (psoriasis), 7820 (infections of the skin not listed elsewhere), 7821 (cutaneous manifestations of collagen-vascular diseases not listed elsewhere), 7822 (papulosquamous disorders not listed elsewhere), and 7824 (diseases of keratinization). See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Under this formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned where there is no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.

A 10 percent rating requires at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

A 30 percent rating requires at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.

A 60 percent rating requires at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy required over the past 12-month period.

The 10, 30, and 60 percent criteria list examples of types of systemic therapy as including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs. Id.

Considering the Veteran's bilateral hand warts as infections of the skin not listed elsewhere, based on a careful review of all the subjective and clinical evidence associated with he claims file at the time of the October 2022 rating decision on appeal, Veteran's bilateral hand warts, did not warrant a higher initial 10 percent rating under the General Skin Rating Formula.  The Veteran's bilateral hand warts do not more nearly approximate at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body, or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or do not require intermittent systemic therapy for a total duration of less than six weeks during the past 12-month period.

Here, the evidence of record, discussed below, demonstrates that the Veteran had recurrent episodes of recalcitrant warts on both hands that started in 2012, for which he underwent cryotherapy on multiple occasions according to his service treatment records, including as recently as November 2019. Although the VA examiner noted that the Veteran treated the condition with topical over-the-counter anti-wart liquid treatments for 6 weeks or more, but not constant, in the past 12 months.  The anti-wart liquid treatment was applied topically to the skin and was not systemically administered in the form of medication to warrant a compensable rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 (a).  The examiner also specifically noted that there were no other treatments or procedures in the past 12 months.  Even considering that the Veteran had previously undergone cryotherapy, these treatments appear to be limited to the skin. Cryotherapy is a method of super-freezing tissue in order to destroy it. MedlinePlus Encyclopedia, National Library of Medicine - National Institutes of Health, https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007506.htm. This method is applied topically through the skin. It is not systemically administered, for example, in the form of medication. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 (a).

Furthermore, on physical examination, the Veteran's multiple warts on both hands were described as verruca appearing lesions with two warts on the dorsum right thumb, one wart on the dorsum right index finger, and two warts on the dorsum left index finger.  The bilateral hand warts were less than 5 percent of the total body area and less than 5 percent of the exposed area.   

Based on the foregoing evidence failing to suggest that the scope or treatment of the Veteran's bilateral hand warts suggestive of infections of the skin not listed elsewhere meets the regulatory criteria for an initial compensable rating, a higher initial rating for such disability is not warranted.

In sum, the Board finds the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a higher initial rating for wart, bilateral hands. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an initial compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
