DOCKET NO. 240418-434737
DATE: April 1, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee medial meniscus tear, status post arthroscopy, with knee effusion (right knee disability) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from November 1994 to July 2014.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran submitted an April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, identifying the April 2024 rating decision.  In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  As the Board is remanding the matter on appeal, if this additional evidence is present, it will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of this matter.

As a final preliminary matter, the Board notes that the Veteran did not waive the remainder of his window to request a docket switch pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (Jun. 21, 2024).  Because the current decision is not a final determination on the benefit sought, the lack of a waiver represents only harmless error by the Board. 

A review of the record shows that there are outstanding pertinent records from VA's Community Care Program, as well as pertinent outstanding records scanned into VA's VistA system.  See January 2024 VA treatment records noting Community Care consult (for right knee) has been completed.  See scanned document for report.  The records of this treatment have not been scanned and/or associated with the record and must be obtained.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(c); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992) (VA medical records are in constructive possession of the agency and must be obtained if pertinent).  On remand, VBA should obtain any outstanding VA Community Care/VA Choice records and associate any records in the VistA system with the claims file.  When the Board identifies a pre-decisional duty to assist error, the Board must remand the appeal back to the AOJ with instructions to correct the error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

                                                                           (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain outstanding VA treatment records, to specifically include the Veteran's VA Community Care/VA Choice program treatment records and any related VistA Imaging records.  See, e.g., January 2024 Community Care Result Note.  If assistance is needed from the Veteran to obtain such records, such should be requested.  Any negative search results should be noted in the record and communicated to the Veteran pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e).
