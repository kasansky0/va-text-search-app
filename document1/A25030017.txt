FINDING OF FACT

In January 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received notification from the Veteran that he wished to withdraw the appeal.??? 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of the claim for an initial rating higher than 10 percent for chronic sinusitis have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for withdrawal of the claim for an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2011 to August 2015.

In a January 2024 rating decision, the VA Regional Office granted service connection for chronic sinusitis, assigning a 10 percent rating, and granted service connection for allergic rhinitis, assigning a noncompensable (0 percent) rating.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement in July 2024, which appealed these issues to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) under the Evidence Review docket.  The Veteran then wrote to VA in January 2025 stating that he wished to withdraw all pending claims and appeals, because he was now rated at 100 percent.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38?C.F.R. §?20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative.  Id.  In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
