CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee postoperative meniscectomy with osteoarthritis, limitation of extension, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 

2. The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for left knee lateral instability have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from June 1976 to August 1979.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee postoperative meniscectomy with osteoarthritis, limitation of extension 

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for left knee lateral instability

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.?38 U.S.C. § 7105.? 

In a June 2023 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran appealed the ratings assigned for his left knee disability.

In July 2023, the Veteran's representative filed a letter requesting that all of the Veteran's remaining appeals be withdrawn. In a September 2023 letter, the Veteran specifically requested that the VA Form 10182 filed on June 12, 2023, be withdrawn.

Only an appellant, or an appellant's authorized representative, may withdraw an appeal. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal.?38 C.F.R. § 20.205(a). 

A written?withdrawal?must include the name of the veteran, the VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.?38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1). The withdrawal is effective when it is received by the Board.?38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(3). 

The July 2023 letter includes the Veteran's name, VA file number, date, and indicates that all pending appeals should be withdrawn. The Board finds the written request for a withdrawal to meet the requirements of?38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

Accordingly, the appeal as to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee postoperative meniscectomy with osteoarthritis, limitation of extension, and a rating in excess of 20 percent for left knee lateral instability is deemed withdrawn, and as there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration, the appeal is dismissed.
