FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A diagnosis of a disability manifested by hand rash is not shown.

2. The Veteran's refractive error is a developmental defect that was not subject to a superimposed disease or injury, which created additional disability, and she is separately rated for bilateral allergic conjunctivitis.

3. The Veteran's lumbosacral strain did not result in forward flexion greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour, and IVDS did not result in incapacitating episodes let alone with a lasting duration of at least two weeks requiring prescribed bedrest by a physician.

4. The Veteran's right and left hip disabilities have not manifested by limitation of flexion to 30 degrees or less.

5. The Veteran's right and left hip disabilities have not manifested by limitation of extension to 5 degrees.

6. The Veteran's right and left hip disabilities have not manifested by limitation of rotation such that she could not toe-out more than 15 degrees or limitation of adduction limited such that she could not cross her legs.

7. Flexion of the Veteran's right knee is not limited to 30 degrees, even considering functional loss after repeated use over time.

8. Considering functional loss after repeated use over time, extension of the Veteran's right knee is limited to 10 degrees.

9. The Veteran's cluster headaches are not shown to be manifested by characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over several months.

10. The Veteran's ventricular septal defect did not manifest by a workload between 7.1 and 10 METs results in heart failure symptoms or required continuous medication required for control.

11. The Veteran's anal fissures did not manifest by slight constant or occasional moderate leakage.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1993 to August 2013, to include service in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

This appeal stems from December 2022 and January 2023 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 and January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Service Connection Claims

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

Establishing service connection generally requires three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Congress has specifically limited entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability.  In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The requirement that a current disability exists is satisfied if the Veteran had a disability at the time the claim for VA disability compensation was filed or during the pendency of the claim.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  See also Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 293 (2013) (Board erred in failing to address pre-claim evidence in assessing whether a current disability existed, for purposes of service connection, at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency).

In Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit essentially found that pain alone resulting in functional impairment is in fact a disability and should not be summarily discounted as a bar to benefits based on a finding of no current diagnosis.

The Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence that it finds persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.? Kahana v. Shinseki, 24?Vet. App.?428, 433 (2011).? This includes weighing the credibility and probative value of lay evidence against the remaining evidence of record.? See King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Kahana, 24?Vet. App.?at 433-34.? 

A claimant bears the evidentiary burden to establish all elements of a service connection claim, including the nexus requirement.  Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2009).? 

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event.? 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §?3.102.? The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination.? See?Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021); Ortiz?v.?Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Hand Rash

The Veteran generally asserts that she has a disability manifested by hand rash. 

The Board finds that the threshold element of the claim for service connection, i.e., a current disability, is not met.  In this regard, the Veteran has not presented competent evidence showing she has a diagnosis of hand rash.  That is, there is no competent evidence of a disability manifested by hand rash from the date of this claim and during the pendency of the appeal.

The available medical treatment records throughout the pendency of the claim fail to show complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of hand rash or a disability manifested by hand rash.

The Veteran underwent a November 2022 VA skin diseases examination, at which time she did not report having a hand rash.  The examiner also did not identify any hand rash but rather only diagnosed left foot tinea pedis.  The left foot was the Veteran's sole complaint regarding any skin disability.

The Board concludes that the Veteran has not presented competent evidence showing that she has a current diagnosis of a hand rash.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (a) ("[A] claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits."); Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that it is the claimant's general evidentiary burden to establish all elements of the claim).

Although the Veteran, as a lay person, is competent to report symptoms she experiences firsthand, such as having a rash, she is not competent to diagnose a skin disability because such requires medical expertise and falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376, n. 4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

Given the absence of competent, current evidence of a diagnosis of hand rash, there is no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  In addition, the evidence does not show any symptoms of hand rash, let alone any resulting in functional impairment of earning capacity.  See Saunders, supra. 

While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's service in Southwest Asia and her confirmed a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), here, there is no lay nor medical evidence of a current hand rash.  Again, the Board emphasizes that the Veteran was provided with a VA examination but did not report any hand rash nor was any identified during the examination.

Therefore, the evidence is persuasively against the claim, and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The appeal is denied.

Vision Loss

The Veteran's service treatment records showed no vision impairment in either eye.  

A VA examination in December 2022 showed uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20/40 on the right and 20/40 on the left corrected to 20/20 on the right and 20/20 on the left.  Near vision was 20/20, bilaterally.

The Board notes that congenital or developmental defects, such as refractive error of the eyes, are not diseases or injuries within the meaning of applicable legislation and, thus, are not disabilities for which service connection may be granted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (c); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.9; Beno v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 439 (1992).  Refractive errors are defined to include astigmatism, myopia, hyperopia, and presbyopia.  As such, service connection is not available for vision problems attributable to refractive errors.  Absent superimposed disease or injury, service connection may not be allowed for a congenital or developmental defect of the eyes, even if visual acuity decreased in service, as this is not a disease or injury within the meaning of applicable legislation relating to service connection.  Parker v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 522 (1991); McNeely v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 357, 364 (1992).  Accordingly, service connection for a refractive error is denied.

Lastly, the Board notes that the Veteran's complaints of having trouble driving and doing paperwork due to allergic conjunctivitis are contemplated by her service-connected allergic conjunctivitis disability.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

Increased Rating Claims

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a veteran's present symptoms with the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based upon average impairment in earning capacity.? 38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. Part 4.? When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.7.? After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the Veteran.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.3.?? 

A disability rating may require re-evaluation in accordance with changes in a veteran's condition.? Thus, it is essential that the disability be considered in the context of the entire recorded history when determining the level of current impairment.? See?38?C.F.R. §?4.1.?? 

When a claimant is awarded service connection and assigned an initial disability rating, separate disability ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time in accordance with the facts found.? Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).  Where the veteran is appealing the rating for an?already established service-connected condition, the present level of disability is of primary concern.? See Francisco v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?55, 58 (1994).? Staged ratings are appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.? Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505 (2007).

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38?C.F.R. §?4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.? See DeLuca v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?202 (1995);?see also?Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?32, 44 (2011).? Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in §?4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or §?4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under §?4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.? See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of §?4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the §?4.71a [or 4.73] criteria.").? 

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is generally to be avoided.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.14.? The critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disabilities is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disability.? See Esteban v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?259, 261-62 (1994).

Lumbar Spine Disability - Rating Criteria

The Veteran's lumbar spine disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5243 for IVDS with lumbosacral strain.

Disabilities of the spine are rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (for Diagnostic Codes 5235 to 5243, unless 5243 is evaluated under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on?Incapacitating Episodes).? Ratings under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine are made with or without symptoms such as pain (whether or not it radiates), stiffness, or aching in the area of the spine affected by residuals of injury or disease.?? 

The General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine provides a 10 percent rating for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.71a.?? 

A 20 percent rating is provided for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. ?? 

A 40 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less, or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.? A 50 percent disability rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.? A 100 percent disability rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of entire spine.? 

The rating criteria provide that for VA compensation purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching.  Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, Note (5). 

The Court has held that a veteran may be entitled to a rating under the General Rating Formula if she experiences the functional equivalent of ankylosis when considering the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45. Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 23-24 (2021).

On February 7, 2021, amendments to the schedule for rating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, including DC 5242 for degenerative arthritis and DC 5243 for IVDS, went into effect.? See 85 Fed. Reg. 76460 (November 30, 2020).? The amendment to DC 5242 clarifies that the rating criteria is to be applied for other than IVDS.? The amendment to DC 5243 for IVDS specifies that it is to be applied only when there is disc herniation with compression and/or irritation of the adjacent nerve root.  Id.

In addition to the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, intervertebral disc syndrome may be evaluated under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes, whichever method results in the higher evaluation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5243.  Under the IVDS Formula, a 10 percent rating requires incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least one week but less than two weeks during the past 12 months.  A rating of 20 percent is warranted for incapacitating episodes with a total duration of at least two weeks but less than four weeks during the past 12 months.  A rating of 40 percent is warranted for incapacitating episodes with a total duration of at least four weeks but less than six weeks during the past 12 months.  A maximum rating of 60 percent is warranted for incapacitating episodes with a total duration of at least six weeks during the past 12 months.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, IVDS Formula.  For these purposes, an incapacitating episode is defined as a period of acute signs and symptoms due to intervertebral disc syndrome that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.  Id.  at Note (1).

Lumbar Spine - Evidence and Analysis

The Veteran underwent a VA back examination in November 2022.  The examiner diagnosed IVDS and lumbosacral strain.  The Veteran reported having dull back pain with shooting pains down the back of her legs from prolonged sitting with numbness and tingling to bilateral legs.  She used a massage chair, exercises, stretches, hearing pad, Ibuprofen, and lumbar support as needed.  She declined having flare-ups.  Functional loss impairment was described as difficulty with prolonged sitting, standing, walking, and bending, which caused increased low back and lower extremity radicular pain.  She had a adjust and change her positions regularly.

On range of motion testing, forward flexion of the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine was normal at 90 degrees.  Extension and right lateral flexion were to 25 degrees and left lateral flexion and bilateral lateral rotation were to 20 degrees.  Passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion.  There was no evidence of pain, crepitus, or localized tenderness/pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue.  There was no additional loss of function or range of motion after repetitive use testing.  The examiner estimated an additional 10-degree loss of motion in flexion, extension, right and left lateral flexion, and right and left lateral rotation due to pain after repeated use over time.  There was no guarding or muscle spasm.  Factors attributing to the disability included interference with sitting and standing, disturbance of locomotion, and interference with forward bending.  Muscle strength testing revealed active movement against some resistance (4/5) throughout) without evidence of muscle atrophy.  Reflex and sensory examinations were normal.  Straight leg raising test was positive, bilaterally.  Symptoms of radiculopathy included moderate intermittent pain, paresthesias, and numbness.  There was no ankylosis.  IVDS did not result in any episodes or acute signs and symptoms requiring bed rest prescribed by a physician.  The Veteran used a back brace regularly.  

On review, the Board finds that the criteria for a rating higher than 10 percent are not met for the thoracolumbar spine.  In this regard, there is no evidence of forward flexion greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  

As the medical evidence reflects, the Veteran's forward flexion was normal throughout the pendency of the claim.  Even considering the functional impairment resulting from pain and other such factors, forward flexion limited to 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees is not shown or approximated.  At worse, forward flexion was limited to 80 degrees even considering additional loss after repeated use over time.  The Board finds that the Veteran's pain in her back and pain on motion is adequately contemplated by the initial 10 percent rating.  

In addition, at worst, her combined range of motion was 140 degrees, which does not meet or more nearly approximate a combined range of motion of 120 degrees.  Further, there is no lay or medical evidence of localized tenderness, muscle spasm, or guarding in the low back, let alone any resulting in abnormal gait or spinal contour.

Next, there were no incapacitating episodes of IVDS let alone for a duration of at least two weeks that required prescribed bed rest by a physician as required by the rating criteria.

Lastly, the Board notes that the December 2022 rating decision granted separate ratings for right and left lumbar radiculopathy associated with the Veteran's lumbar spine disability and assigned an initial 10 percent rating effective October 16, 2022 (the date of the Veteran's claim for increased rating).  The Veteran has not filed a notice of disagreement with the assigned ratings and the VA has already recognized these are separate ratings for neurological complications underlying the Veteran's lumbar disability.  Therefore, the Board is no longer obligated to treat the separately rated bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy as part and parcel of the current appeal for the underlying lumbosacral strain.  See De Hart v. McDonough, No. 21-6249, (2024) (holding that "once radiculopathy is recognized by VA as a distinct service-connected disability with its own rating criteria, it is subject to the same general rules that would govern the appeal of any other separately adjudicated issue").

Right and Left Thigh and Hip - Rating Criteria

The Veteran's bilateral hip disability and bilateral thigh impairment are rated pursuant to DC 5003-5251, 5003-5252, and 5003-5253.  Her limitation of flexion is rated as 10 percent disabling, bilaterally, and limitation of extension and thigh impairment are rated as noncompensable, bilaterally.

DC 5003 (degenerative arthritis) states that degenerative arthritis established by x-ray findings will be rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate DCs for the specific joint or joints involved.  The limitation of motion must be objectively confirmed by findings such as swelling, muscle spasm, or satisfactory evidence of painful motion.  In the absence of limitation of motion, x-ray evidence of arthritis involving two or more major or minor joint groups will warrant a 10 percent rating, and two or more major or minor joint groups with occasional incapacitating exacerbations will warrant a 20 percent rating.  The 10 percent and 20 percent ratings based on x-ray findings will not be combined with ratings based on limitation of motion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5003 Note 1.

DC 5251 provides a rating for limitation of extension of the thigh.  A maximum 10 percent rating is assigned for limitation of extension of the thigh to 5 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5251.

DC 5252 provides a rating for limitation of flexion of the thigh.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 20 degrees.  A maximum 40 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 10 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252.

Under DC 5253 ("Thigh, impairment of"), a 10 percent rating is warranted for limitation of rotation of affected leg, cannot toe out more than 15 degrees.  A 10 percent rating is also warranted for limitation of adduction, cannot cross legs.  A maximum 20 percent rating is warranted for limitation of abduction, motion lost beyond 10 degrees.

Right and Left Hip and Thigh Disabilities - Evidence and Analysis

The Veteran underwent a VA hip and thigh conditions examination in November 2022.  The examiner diagnosed right and left hip degenerative arthritis and right and left knee thigh impairment.  The Veteran reported bilateral lateral dull achy hip pain.  She used hot Epsom salt bath, Ibuprofen, and exercise/stretches for treatment.  She declined having flare-ups.  Functional impairment was described as difficulty kneeling and squatting due to pain and difficulty with prolonged sitting, standing, or walking due to increased pain.

On range of motion testing of the right hip, flexion was to 120 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, abduction to 35 degrees, adduction to 20 degrees, external rotation to 35 degrees, and internal rotation to 25 degrees.  On range of motion testing of the left hip, flexion was to 110 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, abduction to 35 degrees, adduction to 20 degrees, external rotation to 35 degrees, and internal rotation to 20 degrees.  Passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion.  Limitation of motion did not prevent the Veteran from crossing her legs.  There was no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation.  There was no additional loss of function or range of motion after repetitive use testing.  The examiner estimated an additional 10-degree loss of motion in flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and external and internal rotation due to pain after repeated use over time.  Additional factors contributing to the disability included interference with standing and sitting, disturbance of locomotion, and interference with kneeling and squatting.  There was no ankylosis.  There was no malunion or nonunion of the femur, flail hip joint, or leg length discrepancy.  She had no surgeries.  The Veteran used no assistive devices.

On review, the Board finds that higher ratings are not warranted.

Initially, a higher rating under DC 5003 is not warranted because the Veteran has not exhibited degenerative arthritis of 2 or more major joints or 2 or more minor joint groups, with occasional incapacitating exacerbations.  Here, just one major joint is involved, as each hip is rated separately.

Next, a compensable rating pursuant to DC 5251 is not warranted for either hip.  Extension of both hips was at worse to 20 degrees, bilaterally, which does not meet the criteria for a compensable rating under such code (limitation of extension to 5 degrees).  Accordingly, compensable ratings under DC 5251 are not warranted.

A rating higher than 10 percent is not warranted for either hip pursuant to DC 5252.  For a 20 percent rating, there must be evidence of limitation of flexion to 30 degrees.  Here, flexion of both hips was at worse to 110 degrees for the right hip and 100 degrees for the left hip, which does not meet the criteria for even a compensable rating under DC 5252.  However, the Veteran is receipt of a 10 percent rating for each hip due to arthritis with noncompensable limitation of flexion.  Nevertheless, a rating higher than 10 percent is not warranted. 

Lastly, compensable ratings pursuant to DC 5253 are also not warranted.  For a compensable rating, there must be evidence of limitation of rotation of affected leg, without the ability to toe out more than 15 degrees or limitation of adduction preventing crossing the legs.  Here, neither is shown by the available medical evidence of record.

Therefore, a rating higher than 10 percent pursuant to DC 5252 for limitation of flexion in the right and/or left hip is not warranted.  Additionally, a compensable rating for right and/or left hip limitation of extension pursuant DC 5251, as well as for thigh impairment pursuant to DC 5253, is not warranted.

Right Knee - Rating Criteria

The Veteran is currently in receipt of an initial 10 percent rating for her right knee patellofemoral syndrome ("right knee disability") under DC 5260.  She generally seeks a higher rating.

Knee disabilities can be rated under DCs 5256, 5257, 5258, 5259, 5260, 5261, 5262, and 5263.  38?C.F.R. §?4.71a. 

DC 5257 provides a 10 percent rating for slight recurrent subluxation or lateral instability, a 20 percent rating for moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability, and 30 percent rating for severe recurrent subluxation or lateral instability.  38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, DC 5257. 

The words "slight," "moderate" and "severe" as used in various DCs are not defined in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all evidence, to the end that decisions will be equitable and just.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.6.  Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, is not dispositive of an issue.  Instead, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding a request for an increased rating.?38?U.S.C. §?7104;?38?C.F.R. §§?4.2, 4.6; Spellers v. Wilkie,?30?Vet. App.?157?(2018).   

Although the rating criteria do not define "mild," "moderate," and "severe" according to Merriam Webster, "mild" means" gentle in nature or behavior" or "not being or involving what is extreme."  "Moderate" means "tending toward the mean or average amount or dimension" or "limited in scope or effect."  "Severe" means "very painful or harmful" or "of a great degree."  See www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/severe (last accessed February 12, 2025).  

It should also be noted that use of terminology such as "severe" by VA examiners and others, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue.  All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

DC 5258 provides a 20 percent rating may be assigned for dislocated semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.71a.  DC 5259 provides for a 10 percent rating for symptomatic removal of the semilunar cartilage.  38?C.F.R. §?4.71a. 

DC 5260 provides for the evaluation of limitation of flexion of the knee.  A non-compensable (zero) rating is warranted when leg flexion is limited to 60 degrees.  A 10 percent rating is warranted when it is limited to 45 degrees, a 20 percent rating is warranted when it is limited to 30 degrees, and a 30 percent rating is warranted where flexion is limited to 15 degrees.  38?C.F.R. §?4.71a. 

Under DC 5261, extension limited to 5 degrees warrants a 0 (noncompensable) percent rating, extension limited to 10 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating, extension limited to 15 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating, extension limited to 20 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating, extension limited to 30 degrees warrants a 40 percent rating, and extension limited to 45 degrees warrants a 50 percent rating.  38?C.F.R. §?4.71a. 

Under DC 5263,?genu?recurvatum (acquired, traumatic, with weakness and insecurity in weight-bearing objectively demonstrated) warrants a 10 percent rating.  38?C.F.R. §?4.71a.  Genu?recurvatum is hyperextension of the knee.  See DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY (30th Ed. 2003) at 765.

Right Knee - Evidence and Analysis

The Veteran underwent a VA knee examination in November 2022.  The examiner diagnosed right knee patellofemoral syndrome.  The Veteran reported right knee lateral and medial knee pain with heavy lifting or prolonged sitting, standing, and walking.  She used right knee sleeve, heating pad, Icey-hot, and Ibuprofen as needed.  She declined having flare-ups.  Functional impairment was described as increased pain with prolonged sitting, standing, walking, and or heavy lifting.  The Veteran denied having a history of instability, recurrent subluxation, or frequent effusion of the knee.  

On range of motion testing, flexion of the right knee was to 130 degrees with normal extension.  Passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion.  Pain was noted on examination and caused functional loss.  There was no objective evidence of crepitus.  The Veteran verbalized moderate tenderness to the lateral and medial knee joint.  There was no additional limitation of function or range of motion after repetitive use testing.  The examiner estimated that after repeated use over time, flexion of the knee will decrease to 120 degrees and extension to 10 degrees.  Additional factors contributing to the disability included interference with sitting and standing, disturbance of locomotion, and interference with heavy lifting.  There was no muscle atrophy.  There was no ankylosis.  There was no recurrent subluxation or persistent instability.  There was no history of ligament tear or patellar instability.  There was no evidence or diagnosis of shin splints.  The Veteran was never diagnosed with a meniscus condition.  She used a knee brace regularly.  

On review, the Board finds that a rating higher than 10 percent is not warranted; however, a separate 10 percent rating for right knee limitation of extension is warranted. 

A rating higher than 10 percent is not warranted pursuant to DC 5260.  Even when considering functional loss during flare-ups, flexion was estimated to be limited to only 120 degrees in the right knee.  Flexion limited to 30 degrees is not shown or approximated even after repeated use over time at any point during the pendency of the claim.  The current 10 percent rating compensates the Veteran for her painful, limited right knee flexion.

Next, a separate 10 percent rating is warranted pursuant to DC 5261.  As discussed above, the VA examiner estimated that extension will be limited to 10 degrees after repeated use over time due to pain.  Limitation of extension to 10 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating.  However, a rating higher than 10 percent is not warranted because limitation of extension to 15 degrees is not shown or approximated. 

The Board also considered the applicability of other potential DCs during this period on appeal.  However, there is no evidence of knee ankylosis; cartilage removal; instability; meniscus impairment; impairment of the tibia or fibula; or genu recurvatum, and as such, the Veteran is not entitled to a higher or separate rating under DCs 5256, 5257, 5258, 5259, 5262, or 5263, respectively.  

To sum, the Board denies a rating higher than 10 percent pursuant to DC 5260 but assigns a separate 10 percent rating pursuant to DC 5261.

Cluster Headaches - Rating Criteria

The Veteran's cluster headache disability is rated as noncompensable under DC 8100.  Under such code, migraine headaches with less frequent attacks than the criteria for a 10 percent rating are rated as non-compensable.  Migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months are rated 10 percent disabling.  Migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over last several months are rated 30 percent disabling.  Migraine headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability are rated 50 percent disabling. 

The term "prostrating" is not defined in regulation or case law but can be defined as extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.  DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 1531 (32d ed. 2012). 

The rating criteria of DC 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018).  This renders 38 C.F.R. § 4.7 and § 4.21 inapplicable in this case.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

Further, "severe economic inadaptability" is not defined in VA law.  See Pierce v. Principi, 18?Vet. App.?440, 446 (2004).  In addition, the Court has held that nothing in DC 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating.  Id.  It was explained by the Court that if "economic inadaptability" were read to import unemployability, the appellant, should he or she meet the economic-inadaptability criterion, would then be eligible for a TDIU rather than just a 50 percent rating.  Id. citing 38?C.F.R. §?4.16.  The Court discussed the notion that consideration must also be given as to whether the disability was capable of producing severe economic inadaptability, regardless of whether the condition was actually causing such inadaptability.  See Pierce, 18?Vet. App.?at 446.  In this regard, VA conceded that the words "productive of" could be read to mean either "producing" or "capable of producing."  Id. at 446-447. 

The Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria.  Jones v. Shinseki, 26?Vet. App.?56, 63 (2012).

Cluster Headaches - Evidence and Analysis

The Veteran underwent a VA headache examination in November 2022.  The examiner diagnosed cluster headaches.  The Veteran denied receiving ongoing medical care for the condition and stated that cluster headaches developed once or twice a year.  If those headaches did not go away with rest and relaxation, she would go to the emergency room for oxygen therapy, which would resolve the headaches in twenty minutes.  The headaches were accompanied by changes in vision and scent sensitivity.  The duration of a typical headache was less than one day.  The Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks with less frequent attacks.  She did not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of headaches pain productive of severe economic inadaptability.  When she had a headache once or twice a year, it impacted her work as a salesperson because she had to lay down, rest, and relax and possibly go for oxygen therapy.

On review, the Board finds that a compensable rating is not warranted.  For a 10 percent disability rating, there must be evidence of characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months.  Here, the Veteran specifically stated that her headaches occur only twice a year.  In other words, she does not have one headache attack every two months as required by the criteria for a 10 percent disability rating.  As noted above, headaches with less frequent attacks than the criteria for a 10 percent rating are rated as noncompensable.  The appeal is therefore denied.

Ventricular Septal Defect - Rating Criteria

The Veteran's ventricular septal defect is rated as noncompensable under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7000.  

Effective November 14, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7000, valvular heart disease is rated in accordance with the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart.  A 10 percent rating is warranted if a workload between 7.1 and 10 METs results in heart failure symptoms; or continuous medication required for control.   A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 5.1-7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms (including, but not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope), or where there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multi-gated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging).  A 60 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.1-5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms.  A 100 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms.

Ventricular Septal Defect - Evidence and Analysis

The Veteran underwent a VA heart examination in November 2022.  The examiner diagnosed ventricular septal defect.  The Veteran reported no current symptoms.  The examiner noted that the etiology was congenital and that no medications were required for treatment of the condition.  She did not have a myocardial infraction, arrhythmia, heart valve condition, infectious heart condition, or pericardial adhesions.  She had a cardiac catheterization in March 2011.  Physical examination showed normal heart rate and rhythm.  Heart sounds were normal.  There was no Jugular-venous distension.  Auscultation of the lungs was clear.  Peripheral pulses were normal and there was no evidence of peripheral edema.  There were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs or symptoms.  There was no evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation.  A November 2019 echocardiogram was abnormal.  Regional wall motion abnormalities could not be excluded due to limited visualization and there appeared to be a discontinuity in the inter ventricular septum, suggestive of a ventricular septal defect.  Wall thickness was normal.  The examiner noted a prior exercise stress test, during which time the Veteran exercised for 12.27 minutes and achieved 14.20 METs, which was normal.  The examiner noted that at this point (14.20 METs) the test was terminated due to symptoms related to cardiac condition.  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 55 percent and the examiner stated that the Veteran's LVEF is a more accurate finding regarding cardiovascular manifestations alone.

On review, the Board finds that a compensable rating is not warranted.  Notably, the Veteran's METs do not meet the criteria for a compensable rating of 7.1 and 10 METs that results in heart failure symptoms.  The Veteran also denied having any symptoms and is not taking any continuous medications for treatment of her ventricular septal defect.  Accordingly, a compensable rating is not warranted, and the claim must be denied.

Rectal Fissures - Rating Criteria

The Veteran's anal fissure is rated under the Ratings Schedule for the digestive system found in 38 C.F.R. § 4.114.  Effective May 19, 2024, Section 4.114 and DCs 7335-7332 were amended.

Generally, when a law or regulation changes after a claim has been filed, but before the administrative or judicial appeal process has been concluded, the version most favorable to the Veteran applies.  VAOPGCPREC 11-97 (Mar. 24, 1997), VAOPGCPREC 3-2000 (April 10, 2000).  In the usual course, the disability must be rated according to both the old and new rating criteria, and the Veteran must receive the benefit of the more favorable rating schedule.  Pursuant to VA General Counsel Opinion, a new law or regulation has prohibited "retroactive effects" if it is less favorable to a claimant than the old law or regulation; while a liberalizing law or regulation does not have "retroactive effects."  If there are no resulting retroactive effects, VA ordinarily must apply the new provision; however, at no point prior to the effective date of that provision.  See VAOPGCPREC 7-2003 (Nov. 19, 2003); 69 Fed. Reg. 25179 (2004); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.  Because the effective date of the new regulation - May 19, 2024 - is after the evidence window closed in this Direct docket case, the older regulation was in effect at the time of the rating decision.  Therefore, while the AOJ may rate this disability under the new regulation after May 19, 2024, for the purposes of this decision, only the older regulation applies.

The assigned DCs for the Veteran's anal fissure are 7335 "Ano fistula, in" and 7332 "Rectum and anus, impairment of sphincter control."  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7332, 7335.

The version of DC 7335 in effect at the close of the record (i.e., prior to May 19, 2024) directs rating pursuant to DC 7332.  Therefore, the disability is rated under the criteria set forth in DC 7332, which provides as follows: A noncompensable disability rating is assigned for impairment of sphincter control "[h]ealed or slight, without leakage."  A 10 percent disability rating is provided for "constant slight, or occasional moderate leakage."  A 30 percent disability rating is provided for "[o]ccasional involuntary bowel movements, necessitating wearing of pad."  A 60 percent disability rating is provided for "[e]xtensive leakage and fairly frequent involuntary bowel movements."  A 100 percent disability rating is provided for "complete loss of sphincter control."

Rectal Fissures - Evidence and Analysis

The Veteran underwent a VA rectum and anus examination in November 2022.  The examiner diagnosed rectal fissures.  The Veteran denied seeking any ongoing medical care for this condition.  She stated that if she did not drink plenty of water and eat plenty of fiber, she had hard stools that cause or aggravate her anal fissures.  She did not take any medications.  Examination revealed no external hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or other abnormalities.  No leakage was reported or identified.

On review, the Board finds that the evidence does not support a compensable rating for anal fissures.  Specifically, the medical evidence does not reflect constant slight or occasional moderate leakage.  Clinical records do not contradict these findings, and the Veteran does not assert otherwise. 

Therefore, after a careful review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that a compensable rating for the service-connected anal fissure is not warranted. 

Finally, neither the Veteran nor her representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record). 

REASONS FOR REMAND

A remand is necessary to obtain adequate medical opinions for the claimed plantar fasciitis, bilateral breast condition, and pelvis and abdominal pain.  A remand is also necessary provide the Veteran with VA examinations for the claimed lip blisters/herpes and fatigue.  Lastly, a remand is necessary because although the Veteran's service in Saudi Arabia and Qatar was verified, to-date, the AOJ has not prepared TERA memorandum and/or corresponding Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a), it is appropriate and permissible for the Board to remand this appeal to the AOJ to satisfy its statutory duty to obtain a TERA memorandum, ILER entry, and an examination and opinion under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d).

Plantar Fasciitis 

The Veteran underwent a VA foot examination in January 2023.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of any foot disability.  The Veteran reported having occasional shooting pains from the heel into the lower leg.  The pain was intermittent and could last a few seconds.  Functional impairment was described as sharp shooting pain.  The examiner concluded that there was no objective evidence of plantar fasciitis and no medical records of the condition and no current symptoms.  X-rays were not obtained because they were not clinically indicated.  However, the examiner did not explain the relevance if any of the reported heel pain, and whether such resulted in functional impairment of earning capacity.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  The examiner also did not address in-service complaints of right foot shooting pain in February 2011, and complaints of tenderness to palpation of plantar foot in November 2012.   Lastly, the examiner also did not address the Veteran's complaints of the ongoing foot pain since separation from service.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007).  For these reasons, an addendum medical opinion is necessary.

Bilateral Breast Condition

The Veteran's service treatment records contain many complaints of and treatment for breast pain/tenderness and left breast mass/fibroid tissue.  See, e.g., September 2003 STR showing assessment of breast pain.

The Veteran underwent a VA breast conditions and disorders examination in January 2023.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis.  The Veteran reported having occasional breast pain.  Her current symptoms included intermittent episodes of breast pain.  No opinion was provided. 

Here, the examiner did not consider whether the reported pain results in functional impairment of earning capacity.  See Saunders, supra.  The examiner also did not consider whether the Veteran has signs or symptoms of an undiagnosed illness or unexplained chronic multi symptom illness that manifested by breast pain and tenderness.  Accordingly, an addendum medical opinion is necessary.

Pelvis and Abdominal Pain

A January 2023 hip and thigh VA examination includes a discussion of the Veteran's complaints pertaining to the issue of pelvis and abdominal pain.  The examiner noted that the Veteran complaints of intermittent abdominal pain.  The examiner then referred to the stomach condition disability benefits questionnaire.

The January 2023 stomach and doudenal conditions examination report concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a stomach condition.  The Veteran reported that she had abdominal/pelvis pain since service after eating the local food.  She also experienced this while serving in Qatar and using the local water to brush her teeth.  She continued to experience intermittent episodes of abdominal pain.  When she uses the bathroom, the food is whole and not digested.  No medical opinion was provided.  

Here again, the examiner did not consider whether the Veteran's symptoms resulted in functional impairment of earning capacity.  Saunders, supra.  The examiner also did not whether the Veteran has signs or symptoms of an undiagnosed illness or unexplained chronic multi symptom illness that manifested by stomach/pelvis pain.  Additionally, the examiner did not consider in-service complaints of pelvic pain in January 1996.  An addendum medical opinion is necessary.

Blisters on Lips/Herpes

VA treatment records, to include in January 2022 show a diagnosis of herpes labialis.  Moreover, service treatment records dated in December 2004 show complaints of cold sores with a history of cold sores for one year.  

Given the current diagnosis and the in-service complaints of cold sores a VA examination is warranted.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-83 (2006).

Additionally, given the Veteran's confirmed service in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, a TERA medical opinion is necessary.

Fatigue

Service treatment records show complaints of chronic fatigue.  See, e.g., December 1996 STR showing chronic fatigue and February 2011 STR showing complaints of fatigue.

The Veteran is competent to report that she experiences fatigue.  However, the AOJ did not obtain a medical examination or opinion to determine whether the Veteran has a diagnosis of chronic fatigue independent of her diagnosed sleep apnea.  Therefore, an examination with nexus medical opinion is necessary.

For these reasons, a remand is necessary to cure the pre-decisional duty to assist errors. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Prepare a TERA and/or ILER for the Veteran.

2. Contact the relevant record depositories in an attempt to obtain all outstanding military personnel records.  Make at least two meaningful attempts to obtain these records and associate them with the record.  The non-existence or unavailability of such records must be documented for the record and required notice must be provided to the Veteran.

3. Obtain addendum medical opinions from an appropriate VA examiner to help determine the likely etiology of the claimed plantar fasciitis, bilateral breast condition, and pelvic/abdominal pain.  The claims file and a copy of this remand will be made available to the examiner, who will acknowledge receipt and review of these materials.  The need for another examination is left to the discretion of the medical professional offering the addendum opinions.

After review of the record, the examiner is asked to respond to the following: 

Plantar Fasciitis

(a)	Does the Veteran have a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis?  Consider her reports of bilateral shooting heel pain since service.

(b)	If a clinical diagnosis is not warranted, address the Veteran's reported bilateral heel shooting pain and indicate whether it results in a functional impairment of earning capacity.

(c)	Does the Veteran have signs or symptoms of an undiagnosed illness or unexplained chronic multi symptom illness that (at least as likely as not) is manifested by bilateral foot pain?

(d)	Opine whether any diagnosed foot disability had its onset during service or is otherwise related to it, to include complaints of right foot shooting pain in February 2011, complaints of tenderness to palpation of plantar foot in November 2012 during service, and her over twenty years of service. 

Bilateral Breast Condition

(a)	Does the Veteran have a diagnosis of a breast condition that manifests by intermittent breast pain?  Consider her reports of ongoing pain since service, and ongoing in-service complaints and treatment for breast pain/tenderness and left breast mass/fibroid tissue.  

(b)	If a clinical diagnosis is not warranted, address the Veteran's reported bilateral breast pain and indicate whether it results in a functional impairment of earning capacity.

(c)	Does the Veteran have signs or symptoms of an undiagnosed illness or unexplained chronic multi symptom illness that (at least as likely as not) is manifested by bilateral breast pain?

(d)	Opine whether any diagnosed breast disability had its onset during service or is otherwise related to it, to include ongoing complaints of breast pain and suspected left breast mass/fibroid tissue during service.

(e)	Is it at least as likely as not that any currently diagnosed breast pain/disability is due to one or more TERAs during service?  In providing this opinion, the VA examiner must consider: (i) The total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran; AND (ii) the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran.

Pelvic/Abdominal Pain

(a)	Does the Veteran have a diagnosis of pelvic/abdominal condition that manifests by pelvic/abdominal pain?  Consider her reports of ongoing pain since service, and January 1996 in-service complaint of pelvic pain.

(b)	If a clinical diagnosis is not warranted, address the Veteran's reported pelvic/abdominal pain and indicate whether it results in a functional impairment of earning capacity.

(c)	Does the Veteran have signs or symptoms of an undiagnosed illness or unexplained chronic multi symptom illness that (at least as likely as not) is manifested by pelvic/abdominal pain?

(d)	Opine whether any diagnosed pelvic/abdominal disability had its onset during service or is otherwise related to it, to include January 1996 in-service complaint of pelvic pain.

(e)	Is it at least as likely as not that any currently diagnosed pelvic/abdominal pain/disability is due to one or more TERAs during service?  In providing this opinion, the VA examiner must consider: (i) The total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran; AND (ii) the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran.

The standard of review to be applied is "as likely as not" (meaning that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher).

A full and thorough rationale must be provided for all opinions, referencing relevant medical and lay evidence where appropriate.

4. Provide the Veteran with a VA examinations to help determine the likely etiology of the claimed blisters on lips/herpes and fatigue.  The claims file and a copy of this remand will be made available to the examiner, who will acknowledge receipt and review of these materials.

After review of the record and examination of the Veteran, the examiner is asked to respond to the following: 

Blisters on Lips/Herpes

(a)	Elicit from the Veteran the history of all signs and symptoms of the claimed blisters on lips/herpes during service and since separation from service.

(b)	Opine whether any diagnosed blisters on lips/herpes disability had its onset during service or is otherwise related to it, to include December 2004 in-service complaints of cold sores with a history of cold sores for one year.

(c)	Is it at least as likely as not that any currently diagnosed blisters on lips/herpes disability is due to one or more TERAs during service?  In providing this opinion, the VA examiner must consider: (i) The total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran; AND (ii) the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran.

Chronic Fatigue

(a)	Elicit from the Veteran the history of all signs and symptoms of the claimed fatigue during service and since separation from service.

(b)	Does the Veteran have a diagnosis of chronic fatigue independent of her service-connected sleep apnea?  Please consider ongoing complaints of fatigue during service, to include December 1995 documentation of chronic fatigue.

(c)	Does the Veteran have signs or symptoms of an undiagnosed illness or unexplained chronic multi symptom illness that (at least as likely as not) is manifested by chronic fatigue?

The standard of review to be applied is "as likely as not" (meaning that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher).
