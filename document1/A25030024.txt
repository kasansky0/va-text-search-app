DOCKET NO. 241012-485700
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for eligibility for benefits under VA's Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is dismissed.

?

FINDING OF FACT

In February 2025, prior to the promulgation of a Board decision, the Veteran withdrew the instant appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of eligibility for benefits under VA's PCAFC have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The first party to the matter is the Veteran, who served on active duty from October 1985 to February 1986 and from December 1990 to October 1991.  The second party to the matter is her spouse, who applied to be the Primary Family Caregiver. 

The case is on appeal from a July 2024 decision of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In their notice of disagreement (NOD), the appellants identified disagreement with a June 2024 decision.  The files shows that the AOJ did not issue a decision in June 2024.  It issued a decision in July 2024.  In the February 2025 withdrawal, however, the appellant's representative identified the July 2024 decision as the one they had intended to appeal.  Based on this chronology and context, the Board finds that they intended to appeal the July 2024 decision.  

In the NOD, the appellants elected the Direct Review docket.  

Eligibility for benefits under VA's PCAFC

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  An appeal may be withdrawn by the Veteran or representative at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In February 2025 the Veteran's representative submitted a statement.  In doing so, the representative wrote, "We respectfully request that the Board appeal filed 10/12/2024 pertaining to the 7/30/2024 denial of Caregiver benefits be withdrawn.  The Veteran would like to pursue a different appeal route for this particular appeal."

The Board finds that this written withdrawal includes the name of the Veteran, the file number, and unambiguously identifies this appeal as the one she wished to withdraw.  Accordingly, the written withdrawal is considered valid and became effective when received.  See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2020).  

Therefore, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration with regard to this appeal.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The representative went on to clarify that they did not intend to withdraw an earlier NOD file in October 2023 pertaining to an August 2023 denial of Caregiver benefits.  The Board finds that the instant withdrawal does not cover that issue.
