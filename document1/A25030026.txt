ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 28, 2022, for the award of Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is dismissed.

Entitlement to an effective date of August 5, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for aid and attendance, is granted, subject to controlling regulations governing the payment of monetary awards.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. An October 2024 rating decision awarded entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 6, 2011 for the award of DEA, which represents a full award of the benefit sought on appeal 

2. The issue of entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance was part of the January 6, 2011 claim for service connection for ischemic heart disease with coronary artery bypass graft and myocardial infarction that was granted, and it was factually ascertainable that the Veteran had physical incapacity that required care and assistance on a regular basis to protect him from hazards and dangers incident to his daily environment on August 5, 2020, but no earlier, with no evidence that he was substantially confined to his house or immediate premises.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to an earlier effective date for DEA have been met, as the claim has been awarded in full and there is therefore no longer a specific determination with which the Veteran disagrees. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).

2. The criteria for an effective date of August 5, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(l), 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.101, 3.400, 3.350(b), (i), 3.352.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1960 to February 1963, and from December 1964 to December 1967.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO) which granted SMC based on aid and attendance, and DEA from December 28, 2022, the date of intent to file.

In the August 28, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A September 2024 notification advised the Veteran that a hearing was scheduled for December 5, 2024. On December 5, 2024, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Dismissal 

1. DEA

In an October 2024 rating decision, the RO implemented the Office of General Counsel settlement assigning an effective date of January 6, 2011 for the award of service connection for cardiovascular disease. The RO also granted an earlier effective date for DEA effective January 6, 2011, the date of permanent and total disability due to service-connected heart disability.   

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d). See also 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (a) ("the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees"). Here, as a result of the RO granting an earlier effective date of January 6, 2011 for DEA with the earliest possible effective date (because that is the effective date of the grant of service connection, cf. Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232, 248 (2019) ("the effective date of TDIU cannot be earlier than the effective date of the award of service connection for the disability or disabilities upon which the award of TDIU is based")), there is no specific determination, decision, or issue with which the Veteran disagrees, as the benefit he sought has been granted in full. Dismissal of the appeal is therefore warranted.

Earlier Effective Date

2. SMC based on aid and attendance.

SMC is payable to individuals who, as a result of service-connected disability, are so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance of another person under the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a). 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (b)(3). Determinations as to need for aid and attendance must be based on actual requirements of personal assistance from others. In making such determinations, consideration is given to such conditions as the following: inability of claimant to dress or undress herself or to keep herself ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliance which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without aid; inability of claimant to feed herself through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; inability to attend to the wants of nature; or incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from hazards or dangers incident to her daily environment. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a).

It is not required that all the disabling conditions enumerated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a) be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. The particular personal functions which the claimant is unable to perform should be considered in connection with his condition as a whole. It is only necessary that the evidence establish that the claimant is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there is a constant need. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a); see also Turco v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 222, 224 (1996) (holding that at least one factor listed in § 3.352(a) must be present for a grant of SMC based on need for aid and attendance).

In addition, special monthly compensation is payable at a specified rate if the Veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has a service-connected disability rated as total, and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) by reason of such veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is permanently housebound. For the purpose of this subsection, the requirement of permanently housebound will be considered to have been met when the veteran is substantially confined to such veteran's house (ward or clinical areas, if institutionalized) or immediate premises due to a service-connected disability or disabilities which it is reasonably certain will remain throughout such veteran's lifetime. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (b).

38 C.F.R. § 3.401(a)(1) provides that, except as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), the effective date for an award of aid and attendance or housebound benefits is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2) and its authorizing statute, 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2), provide that where evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation, the effective date of the award "shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date, otherwise the date of receipt of the claim." 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(a)(1) also provides that "when an award of pension or compensation based on an original or supplemental claim is effective for a period prior to the date of receipt of the claim, any additional pension or compensation payable by reason of need for aid and attendance or housebound status shall also be awarded for any part of the award's retroactive period for which entitlement to the additional benefit is established."

The Veteran is in receipt of service connection for ischemic heart disease with coronary artery bypass graft and myocardial infarction, rated 100 percent; and loss of tooth #9, rated 0 percent. He is in receipt of a 100 percent rating from January 6, 2011.    

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of SMC based on aid and attendance. Specifically, the Veteran's attorney asserts the Veteran's claim for SMC based on aide and attendance is part and parcel of his service connection claim for heart disability and an effective date of January 6, 2011, date of grant for service connection for heart disability is warranted.

At the outset, the Board notes the Veteran's claim for SMC became part and parcel of the claim for service connection for ischemic heart disease with coronary artery bypass graft and myocardial infarction when service connection was granted in January 2023 with a disability evaluation of 100 percent effective August 10, 2022. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for heart disability was sought within a year and had been continuously pursued, resulting in an Office of General Counsel settlement, in which the Veteran was awarded an earlier effective date of January 6, 2011. Thus, the date of claim for purposes of the effective date analysis is therefore the January 6, 2011 date of claim for service connection. Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394, 396 (2024) ("TDIU is not a separate claim, it is a rating option available whenever a claimant attempts to get service connection or a higher rating from VA and the record includes evidence of unemployability") (emphasis added); Perciavalle v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 117, 122 (2019) ("It is true that SMC benefits "are to be accorded when a veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim").

By way of history, on April 28, 2022, the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim and subsequently submitted a claim on April 27, 2023 for SMC based on the need of regular aid and attendance/housebound. In a July 2023 rating decision, the RO granted SMC based on housebound since Veteran's ischemic heart disease with coronary artery bypass graft and myocardial infarction was rated 100 percent and he was permanently housebound (confined to his dwelling). In the August 2023 rating decision on appeal, the RO granted SMC based on aid and attendance, effective April 28, 2022, the date of intent to file. 

In the October 2024 rating decision, the RO implemented the Office of General Counsel settlement assigning an earlier effective date of January 6, 2011 for the award of service connection for ischemic heart disease with coronary artery bypass graft and myocardial infarction. The RO also granted an earlier effective date for SMC based on aid and attendance, effective February 5, 2021, the date of an aid and attendance or housebound examination report. Thus, the question in this case is whether entitlement arose prior to February 5, 2021.

Although the Veteran's attorney asserts the Veteran's service-connected heart disability solely or partially resulted in his need for aid and attendance benefits dating back to January 6, 2011, the attorney has not however identified any evidence demonstrating the Veteran was in need of care of another or permanently housebound due to service-connected heart disability as of January 6, 2011 date of claim. 

VA clinical records include annual visits dated in November 2011, November 2012, November 2013, November 2014, and October 2015, at which the Veteran reported that he lived with his elderly father and was separated from his wife. The Veteran reported that he ate healthy, walked a lot, and specifically noted at his November 2014 and October 2015 annual visits that he walked three miles daily.  He further noted at his October 2015 annual visit that he played and taught tennis and mowed the yard. The Veteran's coronary heart disease was repeatedly noted as doing well clinically. The ADL assessments performed in November 2016, February 2018, and April 2019 indicated the Veteran was independent with bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding. 

In an August 2020 VA clinical record, the Veteran's wife reported that she was his caregiver and provided him with 24-hour care. In a January 14, 2021 affidavit, the Veteran reported his wife is the caregiver. He further reported the need of round the clock care, and that his day-to-day living has deteriorated in the last three years.

In April 2021, VA received the housebound or aid and attendance examination report dated in February 2021. The examiner noted the Veteran dementia, severe cognitive impairment, coronary heart disease, external dyspnea, renal cell carcinoma, and arthritis of the upper extremities, lower extremities, and lumbar spine. The Veteran is not legally blind and does not require nursing home care. He is confined to bed from 10PM to 9AM. He needs assistance in bathing and tending to other hygiene needs. The Veteran is unable to prepare his own meals. He is able to feed himself. He is able to direct someone to manage his benefit payments. The Veteran requires medication management. The Veteran only leaves home with his spouse/caregiver for medical visits and to visit family. 

In this case, the evidence of record does not demonstrate the Veteran was in need of aid and attendance since January 6, 2011, the date of grant for service connection for heart disability. Rather, the evidence indicates that from August 5, 2020, it was factually ascertainable the Veteran had physical incapacity that required care and assistance on a regular basis to protect him from hazards and dangers incident to his daily environment from that date. As noted above, an August 5, 2020 VA clinical record indicates the Veteran's wife was his caregiver and provided him with 24-hour care and transportation.  The lay and medical evidence do not reflect that he required care and assistance on a regular basis to protect him from hazards and dangers incident to his daily environment or otherwise met the criteria for SMC based on aid and attendance or being housebound prior to that date, and affirmatively shows that in April 2019 he was independent with bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding and could leave his home.

Based on the above, the Veteran's symptoms and impairment did not suddenly get worse on the day of the February 2021 housebound or aid and attendance examination, rather, the lay and medical evidence reflect significant impairment from August 5, 2020.  In this regard, an effective date is not assigned mechanically based on the dates of treatment records, but all of the evidence including lay evidence must be considered. Estevez v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 157, 175 (2023) ("As we have said before, the Board errs when it reflexively assigns the date of a VA examination as the date of an increased evaluation; instead, the Board must analyze the examination report alongside the other lay and medical evidence of record to determine when an increase in disability actually occurred") (citing Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224-25 (2015) (rejecting the mechanical assignment of an effective date based on the date of examination and explaining that, for staged evaluation purposes, VA must examine all relevant facts to determine when an increase in a veteran's disability manifests); DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 58 (2011) ("[A]n effective date should not be assigned mechanically based on the date of a diagnosis. Rather, all of the facts should be examined to determine the date that [a disability] first manifested")).

For the above reasons, it was factually ascertainable that the Veteran needed aid and attendance on August 5, 2020, the date of the VA clinical evaluation showing the Veteran's wife was his caregiver and provided him with 24-hour care and transportation.  There is no lay or medical evidence reflecting that it was factually ascertainable prior to that date that the Veteran needed aid and attendance or that he was confined to his house immediate premises such that SMC based on housebound status was warranted.  Entitlement to an effective date of August 5, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance, is therefore warranted.
