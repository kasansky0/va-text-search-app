REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1987 to February 2008.

This appeal comes from a December 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decisions.? See VA Form 10182 AMA Notice of Disagreement (Direct Review Lane) received April 2024.? Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AMA decision on appeal.? 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Increased Ratings

Ratings for service-connected disabilities are determined by comparing the Veteran's symptoms with criteria listed in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based, as far as practically can be determined, on average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  When rating a service-connected disability, the entire history must be borne in mind.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?589 (1991).  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  The Board will consider entitlement to staged ratings to?compensate?for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal. Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505 (2009). 

The assignment of a particular diagnostic code to evaluate a disability is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case."  See Butts v. Brown, 5?Vet. App.?532, 538 (1993).  One diagnostic code may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, the diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology. 

1. Entitlement to a?compensable?rating for?hypertension.

The Veteran is seeking a?compensable?rating for his service connected hypertension. 

Under Diagnostic Code?7101,?hypertension?warrants a 10 percent rating where diastolic pressure is predominately 100 or more; systolic pressure predominately 160 or more, or if there is a history of diastolic pressure predominately 100 or more and the individual requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent disability evaluation for?hypertension?requires diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code?7101.  Where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a Diagnostic Code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a?compensable?evaluation are not met.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.31. 

There are three notes to?38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code?7101.  Note (1) provides that?hypertension?or isolated systolic?hypertension?must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days.  For purposes of this section, the term?hypertension?means that the diastolic blood pressure (i.e., bottom number) is predominantly 90 mm or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means the systolic blood pressure (i.e., top number) is predominantly 160 mm or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm.  Note (2) requires the evaluation of?hypertension?due to aortic insufficiency or hyperthyroidism, which is usually the isolated systolic type, as part of the condition causing it rather than by a separate evaluation.  Note (3) states that?hypertension?should be evaluated separately from?hypertensive?heart disease and other types of heart disease. 

The Board notes that the rating criteria for Diagnostic Codes?7101?are successive.  In other words, the evaluation for each higher disability rating includes the criteria of each lower disability rating.  Therefore, if any criterion is not met at a particular level, the Veteran can only be rated at the level that does not require the missing component.  See Tatum v. Shinseki,?23?Vet. App.?152, 156?(2009); see also Melson v. Derwinski,?1?Vet. App.?334?(1991) (noting that the conjunctive "and" and "with" in a statutory provision means that all of the listed conditions must be met). 

Having considered all the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence weighs against a?compensable?rating for?hypertension. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2023.  He reported high blood pressure manifested by symptoms of occasional chest tightness and back pressure.  The condition limited his ability to lift following a heart attack.  He required continuous medication for hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure predominantly manifested by diastolic pressure that was 100 or more.  His recorded blood pressure readings were as follows; 110/78, 112/80 and 110/80.  The Veteran's hypertension did not impact the Veteran occupationally.

The Board notes that during the period on appeal, the Veteran's VA treatment records reflect findings consistent with the VA examination report, and nothing in these records show adverse symptomatology to be worse than what was reported by the above VA examiner. Specifically, VA treatment records during the period on appeal reflect the following blood pressure reading; 113/67 and 121/81.  

In sum, while the record demonstrates that the Veteran is required to take medication for control of his?hypertension, the record reflects that the Veteran's diastolic readings have not been predominantly 100 or more and the record similarly shows that systolic readings have not been predominantly 160 or more.  Therefore, a?compensable?rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code?7101. ?38 C.F.R. § 4.3. 

In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the most persuasive evidence is against the claim, the doctrine is not for application.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough,?21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). 

Bilateral Hip Disabilities

Traumatic arthritis shown by x-ray studies is rated based on limitation of motion of the affected joint.? When limitation of motion would be noncompensable under a limitation-of-motion code, but there is at least some limitation of motion, a 10 percent disability rating may be assigned for each major joint so affected.?? 

38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5003 (degenerative arthritis) and 5010 (traumatic arthritis).? Diagnostic Code 5003 states that degenerative arthritis established by x-ray findings will be rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate Diagnostic Codes for the specific joint or joints involved. 38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003.? When, however, the limitation of motion is noncompensable under the appropriate Diagnostic Codes, a rating of 10 percent may be applied to each such major joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion.? The limitation of motion must be objectively confirmed by findings such as swelling, muscle spasm, or satisfactory evidence of painful motion.  38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003.? In the absence of limitation of motion, x-ray evidence of arthritis involving two or more major joints or two or more minor joint groups, will warrant a rating of 10 percent; in the absence of limitation of motion, x-ray evidence of arthritis involving two or more major joint groups with occasional incapacitating exacerbations will warrant a 20 percent rating.? The above ratings are to be combined, not added under Diagnostic Code 5003.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003, Note 1.?? 

The intent of the rating schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability.? Thus, with or without degenerative arthritis, it is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.? 38?C.F.R. §§?4.59; see Burton v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?1, 5 (2011) (holding that the provisions of 38?C.F.R. §?4.59 are not limited to disabilities involving arthritis).?? 

Moreover, when evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities, VA may, in addition to applying the schedular criteria, assign a higher disability rating when the evidence demonstrates functional loss due to limited or excessive movement, pain, weakness, excessive fatigability, or incoordination, to include during flare-ups and with repeated use, if those factors are not considered in the rating criteria.? See 38?C.F.R. §§?4.40, 4.45, 4.59; see also DeLuca v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?202 (1995); Burton, 25?Vet. App.?at 5.? The Court also held in Correia v. McDonald, 28?Vet. App. 158 (2016) that the final sentence of 38?C.F.R. §§?4.59 requires that VA examinations include joint testing for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint.?? 

Nonetheless, a disability rating higher than the minimum compensable rating is not assignable under any diagnostic code relating to range of motion where pain does not cause a compensable functional loss.? Rather, the "pain must affect some aspect of 'the normal working movements of the body' such as 'excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance," as defined in 38?C.F.R. §§?4.40, before a higher rating may be assigned.? See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?32, 37 (2011) (noting that while "pain may cause a functional loss, pain itself does not constitute a functional loss," and, is therefore, not grounds for entitlement to a higher disability rating).?? 

Finally, the Board acknowledges that VA examinations must include joint testing for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.59;?Correia, supra.? 

The Board has also considered the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court's) holding in?Sharp, addressing?38?C.F.R. §?4.40, which states that a VA examiner must "express an opinion on whether pain could significantly limit functional ability" and the examiner's determination in such regard "should, if feasible, be portrayed in terms of the degree of additional range-of-motion loss due to pain on use or during flare-ups."? In light of these requirements, the Board has carefully considered the VA examination of record and whether it complied with?Correia?and?Sharp.? The Board finds the September 2023 VA examination did substantially conform to those requirements. 

2. Entitlement to compensable disability ratings for the right hip and left hip.

The Veteran seeks compensable disability ratings for his service connected right and left hip disabilities based on limitation of flexion and extension.? 

The Board notes that Veteran has established service connection for limitation of adduction/abduction of both hips separately rated as 20 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code?5253, which is the maximum schedular rating available under that code.  See September 2023 rating decision.  The matter of those ratings is not befor the Board and will not be discussed herein.

Simply stated, the Veteran is reciving compensation for the hip problems (20% for each hip - 40% in total).  The only limited question in this case is if the Veteran should receive additional compensation based on the limited issued before the Board.  The Board can not use the problems the Veteran is having his the 20% percent rating for each hip as a basis to give the Veteran more compensation for the hip.  The problem must be different. 

In this regard, the Veteran, as of April 2024, is receiving a 96.6 percentage disability rating. 

Diagnostic Code?5252?compensates based on limitation of flexion of the thigh.? Under the applicable rating criteria, a 10 percent rating is assigned for flexion limited to 45 degrees.? Flexion limited to 30 degrees is afforded a 20 percent rating.? Flexion limited to 20 degrees is afforded a 30 percent rating.  Finally, a 40 percent rating is assigned for flexion of the thigh limited to 10 degrees. ?38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code?5252.? 

Diagnostic Code?5251?affords a single 10 percent disability based on limitation of extension of the thigh when extension is limited to 5 degrees.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code?5251.? Normal extension is to 30 degrees.? 

Hip flexion is measured from 0 degrees to 125 degrees; abduction is measured from 0 degrees to 45 degrees.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Plate II.? 

To the extent that the Veteran has been assigned multiple ratings for his right and left hip disabilities, the Board is cognizant that the assignment of multiple ratings based on the same symptoms or manifestations constitutes prohibited pyramiding.  38?C.F.R. §?4.14.? However, here, the Board finds that the assignment of separate ratings based on limitation of extension, flexion, and abduction of the left hip under Diagnostic Codes?5251,?5252, and?5253?would not amount to pyramiding under?38?C.F.R. §?4.14.? In this regard, separate ratings under different diagnostic codes may be assigned where "none of the symptomatology for any of [the] conditions are duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other... conditions."? See Esteban v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?259, 261-62?(1994).? Here this key consideration has been met, in that limitation of extension, flexion, and abduction/adduction concern excursions of movements in different planes, and these limitations therefore constitute different bases for rating the hip.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.45.? If these limitations are demonstrated, they must be rated separately to adequately compensate for functional loss associated with the service-connected left hip disability. Cf.?VAOPGCPREC 9-2004?(providing that separate ratings may be assigned for disability of the same joint where the Veteran has both limitation of flexion and limitation of extension of same leg); see also Yonek v. Shinseki,?722 F.3d 1355 (2013) (finding separate ratings are not warranted for limitation of motion in different planes of the shoulder because they are not warranted under the applicable diagnostic codes, but that diagnostic codes addressing joints other than the shoulder assign different codes to limitation of motion in different planes, or to limitation of motion in different directions within a single plane, for example, Diagnostic Codes?5252?and?5253?with regard to the thigh).? 

Also applicable to the hip and thigh are Diagnostic Codes addressing ankylosis, flail joint, and impairment of the femur (nonunion, false joint, or malunion).  38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5250, 5254, 5255.? As is noted below, the Veteran does not show such pathology, and therefore, these Diagnostic Codes to not apply in this matter.? 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2023 to evaluate his right and left hip disabilities.  He endorsed moderate right hip flare-ups and severe left hip flare-ups described occurring twice a week and lasting one or two days.  The flare-ups were productive of limited range of motion and move slower.  Passive and active range of motion of the right hip showed flexion to 50 degrees, extension was to 10 degrees, adduction was to 0 degrees, abduction was to 0 degrees, external rotation was 30 degrees, and internal rotation was to 15 degrees with repeated use over time and with flare-ups.  Left hip flexion was to 50 degrees, extension was to 10 degrees, adduction was to 0 degrees, abduction was to 0 degrees, external rotation was120 degrees, and internal rotation was to 20 degrees with repeated use over time and with flare-ups.  Adduction was limited in such a way to prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs.  There was no muscle atrophy.  There was no evidence of pain with weight bearing.  There was pain with active and passive range of motion, bilaterally.  The Veteran did not require assistive devices for ambulation.  Occupationally, the right and left hip disabilities were productive of pain with climbing, kneeling, squatting, and lunging, as well as limitations with prolonged walking or running.  

The Board notes that during the period on appeal, the Veteran's VA treatment records reflect findings consistent with the VA examination report, and nothing in these records show adverse symptomatology to be worse than what was reported by the above VA examiner. 

This evidence shows painful flexion with a noncompensable limitation of motion bilaterally.? The Veteran has not demonstrated flexion of the right or left thigh limited to 45 degrees; at its worst, hip flexion was only limited to 50 degrees, bilaterally.? Additionally, the evidence fails to show extension limited to 5 degrees in either hip.  The clinical findings do not demonstrate that the Veteran's symptoms result in additional functional limitation to a degree that would support compensable ratings under Diagnostic Code 5251 or higher ratings under Diagnostic Code 5252, even with consideration of whether there was additional functional impairment due to DeLuca factors.? See 38?C.F.R. §?4.71, Diagnostic Code 5252; 38?C.F.R. §§?4.40, 4.45, 4.59; See DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 207; see also Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 32; Correia, 28 Vet. App. at 158; Sharp, 29 Vet. App. at 26.?? 

The Board has carefully reviewed the other available evidence of record, to include the available medical treatment records for the relevant period in question, but finds nothing further which it could use to apply the statutory rating criteria or other pertinent caselaw.?? 

In sum, the Board finds that separate compensable disability ratings for limited flexion of the right hip or left hip are not warranted.? The most persuasive evidence weighs against the claims for compensable ratings for limitation of extension of the right or left hip.? The Board finds that the evidence weighs against the assignment of any ratings higher than those assigned.? See?38?U.S.C. §?5107;?38?C.F.R. §?3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.? ??? 

(Continued on the next page)

?

Finally, the Board does not find that this case raises a?claim?for a total disability evaluation based upon individual?unemployability?(TDIU).  See?Rice?v. Shinseki, 22?Vet. App.?447, 454 (2009).  The evidence of record does not show,?nor?does the Veteran?claim, that he is?unemployable?due to his service connected disabilities.  While the evidence of record, to include the treatment and examination reports, show that the?Veteran's service connected bilateral hip disabilities are productive of some impairment, to include difficulty climbing, kneeling, squatting, and lunging, as well as limitations with prolonged walking or running, there is no evidence that the?Veteran?was unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment solely as a result of his service-connected disabilities, either singularly or?jointly.  In fact, other than limitations due to the hips, the VA examiner found no occupational impairment as a result of the service connected disabilities on appeal, nor has the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940.  Consequently, a?claim?for TDIU has not been raised by the record and no action pursuant to?Rice?is warranted.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
