FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's low back condition began during active service or within one year of service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

2. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's radiculopathy, left lower extremity, femoral nerve involvement is etiologically related to any service-connected condition.

3. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's radiculopathy, left lower extremity, sciatic nerve involvement is etiologically related to any service-connected condition.

4. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's radiculopathy, right lower extremity, sciatic nerve involvement is etiologically related to any service-connected condition.

5. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's radiculopathy, right lower extremity, femoral nerve involvement is etiologically related to any service-connected condition.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1990 to August 1991, from January 2003 to March 2006, and from June 2006 to January 2007.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for low back condition, bilateral femoral radiculopathy, and bilateral sciatica lower leg. That same month, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review. In June 2024, the AOJ issued a higher-level review decision continuing the denial of service connection for low back condition, bilateral femoral radiculopathy, and bilateral sciatica lower leg.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.? 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. §?20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801.? 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. §?3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.? 

The Board notes that the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement also lists the issue of service connection for headaches. However, at the time the Veteran filed the Notice of Disagreement, the issue of headaches was under development for a VA examination with medical opinion in order to correct a duty to assist error. Thus, the Board does not have jurisdiction to address the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for headaches.

Service Connection 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during the service - the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

In addition, service connection for certain chronic diseases may be established on a presumptive basis by showing that the condition manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a); Fountain v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?258, 271-72 (2015). Although the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). 

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F. 3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for low back condition

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to service connection for a low back condition on a direct basis.

The Board is bound by previous favorable findings, and the June 2024 rating decision found that the Veteran has been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) with unspecified inflammatory spondylopathy, lumbar region.

However, the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's low back condition manifested during, within the year following, or as a result of active service. As such, service connection cannot be established on a direct basis.

Military personnel records show the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) as a material control and accounting specialist.

The available service treatment records (STRs) are silent for any complaint, treatment, or diagnosis of a low back condition. While the Veteran reported that his pain has worsened since 1990 when he was injured in service, subsequent STRs from 2006 and 2007 reflect a zero pain level.

In February 2024, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's low back condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. After reviewing the available evidence, the examiner reasoned that there is a lack of substantiating evidence supporting a nexus between the Veteran's current low back condition and military service. The examiner added that without chronicity during or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology.

Based on the foregoing, there is no evidence that the Veteran's low back condition manifested in service or to a compensable degree in the first year following his separation from service. According to post-service medical records, the first finding and treatment of a low back condition occurred in 2023, over 15 years after separation from service. In addition, the evidence of record does not support the Veteran's subjective complaints. For example, he reported numbness in his left lateral thigh that was present for approximately four years prior to his neck surgery in 2017. However, VA medical records show only one complaint of numbness, and it concerned below the knee of the left leg in August 2017. Additional records showed full strength and capability in the lower extremities around that time. Consequently, service connection for a low back condition on the basis that such became manifest in service and persisted, or on a presumptive basis (as a chronic disease under 38 U.S.C. § 1112), is not warranted.

The record also lacks evidence that the Veteran's low back condition is otherwise related to service. The Veteran's post-service treatment records are silent for an opinion relating his low back condition to service. As noted above, it was not until 2023 that the Veteran was diagnosed with a low back condition.

The only competent evidence in the record that addresses the question of service connection is the February 2024 VA medical opinion, which stated that the Veteran's low back condition was not related to his service. As there is no other evidence to the contrary, and the February 2024 VA medical opinion was based on a full review of the available evidence as well as an interview of the Veteran, the Board finds it persuasive.

Further, the Veteran's own statements relating his low back condition to service are not competent evidence, as he is a layperson and lacks the training to provide an adequate opinion regarding medical etiology. Specifically, the Veteran lacks the training to opine whether a low back condition, in the absence of credible evidence of continuity, as here, is related to an incident in service. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (Whether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a fact issue to be addressed by the Board rather than a legal issue to be addressed by the Veterans Court. Also, a low back condition is a disease of the musculoskeletal system, and the record does not show that the Veteran has training or education in this medical field; therefore, lay evidence of the etiology is not competent nexus evidence as it is not capable of lay observation. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 307-08 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465,469-70. Thus, the Veteran is not competent or qualified, as a layperson, to render an opinion on medical causation. 

In light of the foregoing, the Board concludes that the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a low back condition. Accordingly, it must be denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy, left lower extremity, femoral nerve involvement as secondary to non-service-connected low back condition

3. Entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy, left lower extremity, sciatic nerve involvement as secondary to non-service-connected low back condition 

4. Entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy, right lower extremity, sciatic nerve involvement as secondary to non-service-connected low back condition 

5. Entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy, right lower extremity, femoral nerve involvement as secondary to non-service-connected low back condition 

The Veteran contends that his bilateral radiculopathy, femoral nerve involvement and bilateral radiculopathy, sciatic nerve involvement are secondary to his non-service-connected low back condition. See November 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation).

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability caused or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); see Allen v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?439 (1995) (en banc). To establish service connection for a secondary disability, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) the existence of a service-connected disability; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the service-connected disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b). 

First, favorable findings from the June 2024 rating decision were that the Veteran has diagnoses of bilateral radiculopathy, femoral nerve involvement and bilateral radiculopathy, sciatic nerve involvement. Thus, the first element of secondary service connection has been satisfied. 

However, the Veteran's contention is that these conditions are secondary to his low back condition. The Veteran's low back condition is currently not service connected. Thus, the second element of secondary service connection is not met. Specifically, where the primary disability has not been service connected, as here, the Veteran cannot establish entitlement to service connection for a secondary condition as a matter of law. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.310(a); Reiber v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 516-17 (1995). The Board recognizes that the February 2024 VA examiner described the Veteran's low back condition as service-connected. The evidence shows that this was done in error (that is, this particular examiner appears to have mistakenly believed that the Veteran's low back condition was service connected when it was, in actuality, not service connected) and this opinion is therefore given no weight by the Board.

?

As the Veteran has no service-connected disability which may have caused or aggravated bilateral radiculopathy, femoral nerve involvement and bilateral radiculopathy, sciatic nerve involvement, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply and service connection on a secondary basis must be denied at law. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Reiber, 7 Vet. App. at 516-17; Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
