ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for asthma pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (Aug. 10, 2022), is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran submitted an intent to file (ITF) a claim for entitlement to service connection for asthma on July 26, 2023, the claim in September 2023, and is presumptively entitled to service connection for asthma as a result of exposure to fine particulates, burn pits and other toxins while stationed in Kuwait during the Gulf War. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for asthma have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (2),1120 and the PACT Act.

REASON AND BASIS FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1990 until February 1994. He was honorably discharged from active duty. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied an earlier effective date for the Veteran's asthma claim. In July 2024, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) requesting the direct review docket with review by a Veterans Law Judge.  

The December 2023 rating decision granted the Veteran service connection for asthma with an effective date as of the date of the VA examination and not the date of the Veteran's ITF, claim or PACT Act. In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) asserting that he filed an ITF on July 26, 2023, and the claim in September 2023, and the PACT Act deadline of August 2023 was satisfied to ensure an effective date of August 10, 2022. The May 2024 HLR rating decision denied an earlier effective date pursuant to the PACT Act or the date of the ITF. 

The evidentiary record in a HLR is limited to the evidence considered in the prior AOJ decision under review; the higher-level adjudicator may not consider additional evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601 (f). Thus, in reviewing a HLR decision, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the underlying rating decision for which the appellant requested HLR (as that is the evidence that the AOJ was permitted to consider in the HLR decision on appeal), as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran during an evidentiary window. In this case, as the May 2024 rating decision on appeal constitutes a HLR rating decision, the Board's current review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's December 2023 rating decision. Additionally, as the Veteran elected the direct review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The denial of due process may include issuing a Board decision prior to the expiration of the one-year period for a claimant to request a docket change. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  In this case, the Board is granting entitlement to the full benefits sought so the Veteran's due process rights are not affected by deciding the case prior to May 17, 2025, the end of the period in which to request a docket change. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date August 10, 2022, 2023, but no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for asthma is granted.

Generally, the effective date of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

There is no regulatory definition of the phrase "date entitlement arose." However, in Wright v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 343 (1997), the phrase "date entitlement arose" was found to be similar to the phrase "facts found." This case and the regulatory context, indicate that the "date entitlement arose" is the date on which the facts in the case demonstrate that the entitling criteria are first met. The entitling criteria for a claim are frequently met on or before the date of claim based on the lay, medical, and other information presented during the entire process of claim development. When applying the general rule, the assignment of an effective date  based on date entitlement arose being later than the date of the claim is only appropriate when the evidence clearly establishes that the entitling criteria were not met as of the date of receipt of the claim.

If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in paragraph (a) of 38 C.F.R. § 3.160, appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. 

On August 10, 2022, the PACT Act was signed into law. The PACT Act expanded the presumption of service connection for certain diseases for veterans who served in certain locations. Id. The law provides that, where compensation is awarded pursuant to any Act or administrative issue, the effective date shall not be earlier than the effective date of such Act or administrative issue. In no event shall the award be retroactive for more than one year from the date of application or the date  determination of entitlement, whichever is earlier. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g). See also, 38 C.F.R. §  3.114.

For veterans who served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, asthma is a presumptive disease which is considered service connected even though there is no evidence of such a disease during a period of active service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320. This presumption applies if the asthma manifested to any degree within 10 years from the date of separation from a qualifying period of military service. 38 C.F.R. 3.320(a)(5). For the purposes of this presumption, the Southwest Asia theater of operations, includes Kuwait for service in these locations on or after August 2, 1990. 38 C.F.R. §3.2 (i); 3.317 (e)(2).

Asthma is also presumed to be service connected as a result of exposure to burn pits and other toxins when the asthma was diagnosed after service in Kuwait beginning August 2, 1990. 38 USC 1120(a) and (b). The provision for burn pits, unlike the provision for fine particulate matter, does not have a requirement that the asthma have manifested within 10 years of the qualifying duty.   

In this case, the November 2023, VA asthma examiner noted that the date of the onset and diagnosis of the Veteran's asthma was in 1992. It was unclear whether this date was identified by the Veteran as there was not an asthma diagnosis in the record until this VA examination. The December 2023 rating decision found the Veteran was entitled to service connection for asthma pursuant to 38 C.F.R. 3.320, which pertains to diseases presumed to be service connected as a result of exposure to fine particulate matter for covered veterans. As noted above, the provision for burn pits also contains a presumption of service connection for asthma for covered veterans. See, 38 USC 1120(a) and (b).

The Veteran served in Southwest Asia, in Kuwait during the relevant presumptive period and is thus considered a Persian Gulf Veteran pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.317. See, Veteran statement to November 2023 VA sinusitis examiner; December 2022 and January 2023 VA Memoranda; October 2023 Toxic Exposure Risk Activity memorandum. As the Veteran was stationed in Kuwait at some point from August 1991 to February 1994, he is a covered Veteran under both the fine particulate matter provision (38 C.F.R. 3.320) and the burn pit exposure provision. (38 USC 1120(a) and (b)).

As noted above, the effective date of the PACT Act is August 10, 2022. The Veteran filed an ITF on July 26, 2023, and the claim was filed in September 2023. As the Veteran's claim was filed within one year of the ITF, the  date of filing is considered to be July 26, 2023. See, 38 C.F.R. § 3.160. The effective date for PACT Act claims filed between August 10, 2022, and August 10, 2023, may go back to August 10, 2022. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g). As the Veteran is considered to have filed his asthma claim on July 26, 2023, which was between August 10, 2022, and August 10, 2023, the earlier effective date of August 10, 2022, is applicable. Accordingly, the appropriate  effective date for the Veteran's entitlement to service connection for asthma is August 10, 2022, but no earlier.
