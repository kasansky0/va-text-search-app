DOCKET NO. 241230-496527
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

The claim of entitlement to an initial compensable rating for empty sella syndrome is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025 correspondence, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran, through his representative, withdrew his appeal for a compensable rating for empty sella syndrome.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an initial compensable rating for empty sella syndrome have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Air Force from March 1967 to March 1971.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in October 2024.

The claim had been continuously pursued from a September 2021 decision. The September 2021 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for empty sella syndrome, with a noncompensable rating, effective October 16, 2015. In April 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 appealing the September 2021 rating decision. In December 2023, the Board remanded the issue of an initial compensable rating for empty sella syndrome for additional development, including obtaining private treatment records. Thereafter, an October 2024 rating decision continued the noncompensable rating for empty sella syndrome.

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. On March 31, 2025, the Veteran, through his representative, withdrew the hearing request.

Subsequently, in March 2025, the Veteran's representative submitted a letter of "formal notification" that the Veteran wished to withdraw the issue of "empty sella syndrome." See March 31, 2025 BVA Motion to Vacate, 1. 

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board does not have jurisdiction over issues withdrawn by an appellant. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.205, an appellant can withdraw his or her appeal via written correspondence. Thus, the Board has no jurisdiction to consider the withdrawn issue, and it shall therefore be dismissed.
