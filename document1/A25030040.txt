ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a left foot disability is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that a left foot disability began during active service or is otherwise related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a left foot disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1980 to March 1996.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In March 2021, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim. In May 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision that denied the claim. In July 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), along with an extension request.  In September 2022, the AOJ found a duty to assist error and returned the appeal so that an examination could be scheduled. In February 2024, the AOJ denied the claim. In March 2024, the Veteran filed a HLR request. In June 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2024 decision.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for a left foot disability

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  A Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469.  Generally, lay testimony is not competent to prove a matter requiring medical expertise.  Id. at 470.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran contends that he injured his left foot in May 1983 in a karate tournament when his left foot struck his opponent's elbow.  March 2021 Statement in Support of Claim.  The Veteran reports having left foot pain since that incident.  Id.  The Veteran reports current symptoms of pain, swelling, cracking, and popping in his foot.  Id.

Service treatment records show that the Veteran had a normal foot exam in his June 1979 entrance examination.  In the accompanying Report of Medical History, the Veteran reported no foot trouble.  In a May 1983 treatment note, the Veteran reported left foot pain after he struck his left foot against another man's elbow.  X-rays were normal. He was diagnosed with a soft tissue injury.  The Veteran had normal foot examinations in April 1984 and October 1985 Reports of Medical Examination.  In a July 1991 Report of Medical History, the Veteran reported no foot trouble.  In the July 1991 re-enlistment physical, the Veteran had a normal foot examination.  In December 1991, August 1995, and January 1996 Reports of Medical History, the Veteran reported no foot trouble.  In the undated separation examination, the Veteran had a normal foot examination.

There are no private treatment records relevant to the issue of entitlement to service connection for a left foot disability.

There are no VA treatment records relevant to the issue of entitlement to service connection for a left foot disability.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2023.  He states that he injured his left foot in 1983 when he kicked an opponent at a karate tournament.  He further states that he has had issues with his left foot ever since.  The examiner diagnosed left foot strain and opined that it was less likely than not related to his active service.  The examiner noted the Veteran's May 1983 left foot injury but also found that there was no diagnosis at the time and X-rays were normal.  The examiner found that the initial injury was not chronic in nature and required no additional follow-up.  The Veteran served another 13 years with no additional follow-up for his left foot, either in service or since leaving service. Therefore, the examiner found that the Veteran's May 1983 left foot injury had resolved and is not related to the current diagnosis of left foot strain. 

The Board finds the September 2023 VA examination and opinion to be highly probative.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008).  The examiner reviewed the file, addressed the relevant medical history, and provided a rationale. The examiner acknowledged the Veteran's lay statements regarding symptoms, but placed more weight on the lack of objective findings. 

There is no evidence of record other than the Veteran's own lay assertions indicating that his left foot strain may be associated with his military service. Indeed, none of the post-service medical treatment records reflect any such opinion or comment to that effect, and he has not intimated that any such evidence or opinion exists. The Veteran has not submitted any medical evidence suggesting his left foot strain may otherwise be related to his military service.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that his current left foot strain was caused by the May 1983 left foot injury.  However, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis of a left foot condition or to provide an etiology opinion.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). His opinion has no probative value. 

For the above reasons, the evidence persuasively weighs against entitlement to service connection for a left foot disability.  As the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximate, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  For these reasons, the claim is denied.
