REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from October 1986 to July 1990.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in March 2024.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A?(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Here, the Board finds that the February 2024 opinion requires clarification and cannot be relied on by the Board without further addendum. The Veteran claimed that his in-service knee injuries contributed to his post-service knee injury which required surgical intervention.  The February 2024 examiner noted the Veteran's in-service injuries and opined these injuries corroborated the Veteran's contentions.  However, the examiner offered a negative nexus opinion without explaining how they arrived at such conclusion. Additionally, the opinion relies almost exclusively on the gap in treatment records regarding his knee. Consequently, the Board finds that this matter must be remanded for an addendum opinion to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's right knee condition is at least as likely as not (the evidence is approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not greater) related to the Veteran's in-service knee injuries and complaints. The opinion should be accompanied by an adequate rationale that should engage with the Veteran's stated theory (that his in-service right knee injuries weakened his knee making it vulnerable to later injury) and should not be based only on a gap in treatment for the condition, though that may be a part of the rationale in combination with other circumstances.
