FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's acquired psychiatric condition, to include PTSD and an adjustment disorder, is related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1979 to October 1983.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued in December 2020 and March 2021.

In the May 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on August 29, 2023. A transcript of that hearing is associated with the claims file.

The matters of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition and for asthma were addressed in the December 2020 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal with respect to those issues, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

The matters of entitlement to service connection for emphysema and prostate cancer were addressed in the March 2021 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2021 AOJ decision on appeal with respect to those issues, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for asthma, emphysema, and prostate cancer, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

These matters were previously before the Board in April 2024, along with other issues no longer on appeal. The Board denied service connection for the listed conditions in that decision. The Veteran appealed that denial to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Veterans Court) which vacated the decisions and remanded them pursuant to a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (Joint Motion) in December 2024.

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability to include PTSD and adjustment disorder, is granted.

The Veteran has claimed service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition. 

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that is related to service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Though the Board's review of the evidentiary record is restricted as described in the introduction, the Board has taken notice of the subsequent decision making by VA regarding this issue. In October 2024, VA issued a decision granting service connection for the acquired psychiatric condition. Therefore, the Board finds that service connection for the acquired psychiatric condition should be granted to harmonize the findings in this decision with the broader determination in this matter overall. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A?(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

1. The matters of (1) Entitlement to service connection for emphysema; (2) Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer; and (3) Entitlement to service connection for asthma are remanded.

As discussed in the introduction, these matters were previously addressed by the Veterans Court in December 2024. The Joint Motion that resulted in these matters being remanded to the Board contained a finding that VA had failed to provide the Veteran of notice of the right to a hearing prior to the issuance of a rating decision by the AOJ. 38 U.S.C. § 501; 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b), (d). Therefore, there has been a failure to comply with VA's duty to assist prior to the rating decision on appeal. Consequently, the Board must remand this claim to provide this notice to the Veteran and have the remaining claims on appeal readjudicated.

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Provide the Veteran with notice of the right to have a hearing prior to the adjudication of the claims pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b), (d). After this notice, and adequate time to respond, is provided to the Veteran readjudicate the claims.
