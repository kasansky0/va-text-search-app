ORDER

Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, entitlement to an initial disability rating of 10 percent for hypertension is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hypertension is manifested by a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial disability rating of 10 percent for hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1969 to November 1971.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The May 2024 rating decision was a higher-level review of a January 2024 rating decision. 

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Id. 

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for hypertension.

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating because he believes his hypertension is more severe than indicated by his noncompensable rating. The Veteran claims that since he was diagnosed with hypertension, he has been on prescription to control and lower his blood pressure daily. He believes that without the medication, his diastolic and systolic pressure readings exceed the noncompensable rating. See September 2024 Notice of Disagreement.     

Legal Criteria

Hypertension is rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension).  Under DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria.  Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common."  See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

Regarding the "minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control," this is intended to compensate veterans who do not have current readings establishing entitlement to a 10 percent rating if those veterans are using medication to control their blood pressure. Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75, 78 (2021). DC 7101 contemplates the ameliorative effects of medication and thus, a veteran can be entitled to a compensable rating even if he does not have current blood pressure readings above the statutory thresholds when there is a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more. McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 273 (2016). Pre-medication blood pressure readings are the appropriate data set when determining whether there is a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more. Wilson, 35 Vet. App. at 78. 

Factual Background

The Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension in July 2021 by his private physician. The Veteran's blood pressure reading at the diagnosing appointment was 170/100. The Veteran's provider prescribed him Losartan 50mg daily. The Veteran reported that his hypertension was discovered after a complaint of refractory nose bleeds. See July 2021 Havard Heart medical records.  

At his August 2021 appointment, his blood pressure readings were 130/84 and 136/82. See August 2021 Havard Heart medical records. In September 2023, his blood pressure was 140/76. See September 2021 Havard Heart medical records.  

In January 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA hypertension examination. The Veteran reported that he takes continuous medication, and the examiner noted that the Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more. 

Analysis

For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that the Veteran's hypertension has manifested in the history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more requiring continuous medication for control, corresponding to the criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 7101.

The Board acknowledges that the VA examiner stated that the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more. See January 2024 VA examination. In accordance with the Wilson case, and given that the Veteran's hypertension requires medication for treatment, the Board must consider readings during the appeal period, as well as blood pressure readings prior to the appeal period to determine whether the Veteran has a history of diastolic pressure of 100 or more. 35 Vet. App. at 78. 

The Veteran's medical records show readings of diastolic pressure under 100; however, the Veteran's diastolic pressure did not lower under 100 until he was put on continuous medication in July 2021. Although the record has several normal blood pressures after the Veteran's hypertension became controlled and after several months of medication, the record only shows one blood pressure reading before medication was prescribed. A blood pressure of 170/100 was noted in the July 2021 Havard Heart record, which was the same day the Veteran was officially diagnosed with hypertension and prescribed continuous medication. Prior to his diagnosis, the Veteran had been experiencing nosebleeds, which indicates that his blood pressure had been consistently high and that his reading of 170/100 was representative of his blood pressure prior to his diagnosis. As such, giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and given that the Veteran requires medication to control his blood pressure, the Board finds that the Veteran has a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control. Therefore, entitlement to an initial disability of 10 percent for hypertension is granted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

Accordingly, during the appeal period, the Veteran's hypertension warrants the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control, corresponding to the criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 7101. 

?

However, a higher 20 percent rating under DC 7101 is not warranted unless diastolic pressure is predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure is predominantly 200 or more. The aforementioned medical records show no diastolic reading that was 110 or more and no systolic readings that are 200 or more. Thus, during the appeal period, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. Accordingly, the Veteran's hypertension does not more nearly approximate the criteria corresponding to a 20 percent rating. A higher 20 percent rating is therefore not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.
