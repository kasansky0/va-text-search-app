REMANDED

Entitlement to compensation pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for residuals of bilateral inguinal hernia repair, also claimed as right iliohypogastric nerve block, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1969 to November 1970. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision by an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing before the undersigned was held on December 13, 2024. 

Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). The Board notes that evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, however, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims for entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for complications after bilateral inguinal hernia repair surgery, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Remand is permitted only to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors, or for correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

In a claim for compensation pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1151, fault may be established based on the fact that VA furnished care without informed consent. 38 U.S.C. § 1151. Informed consent in turn is specifically defined and requires that certain information be provided. 38 C.F.R. § 17.32(b). In order to ensure that proper informed consent was obtained prior to the surgery at issue, the Board must review the complete version of the informed consent. 

The Veteran's VA treatment records note that the Veteran underwent surgery for bilateral inguinal hernia repair in July 2012, the residuals of which are under appeal. A June 2012 VA treatment record includes a version of the informed consent given by the Veteran prior to his July 2012 bilateral inguinal hernia repair surgery. However, the informed consent document of record appears to be an abbreviated version and indicates that the full informed consent document may be accessed through Vista imaging. This image is not part of the claims file, which constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error. The Board cannot assess the examiner's medical opinion, including rationale, or the extent of the consent given by the Veteran without the full informed consent included in the claims file.

Accordingly, the Board finds that remand is necessary so that all records contained in Vista imaging, to include a full copy of the informed consent, can be obtained and associated with the file.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain and associate with the claims file all medical records contained in Vista imaging, including a full copy of the informed consent signed in June 2012, or any other consent document signed related to the July 2012 bilateral inguinal hernia repair surgery.

All actions to obtain the records must be documented. If the records cannot be located or do not exist, the Veteran must be notified and given an opportunity to provide them.
