ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of July 15, 2022, but no earlier, for 70 percent evaluation for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of July 15, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Since July 15, 2022, the Veteran's PTSD has been manifested by symptoms of depression, anxiety, panic attacks, suicidal ideation, impaired concentration and/or attention, obsessive rituals which interfere with routine activities, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, and productive of social and occupational impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

2. The Veteran has been found to have a permanent and total evaluation due to service-connected disabilities effective July 15, 2022. Accordingly, entitlement to DEA benefits under Chapter 35 is established from that date.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of July 15, 2022, for a 70 percent rating for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o)(2), 4.1-4.14, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

2. The criteria for entitlement to DEA benefits under Chapter 35 from July 15, 2022, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510, 5107, 5113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 2005 to October 2014. He has additional service in the United States Army Reserve from May 2002 to May 2005, and from October 2014 through at least September 2023.

This appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) is from a June 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), hereinafter the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the notice of the February 2024 AOJ decision (February 16, 2024), which was subsequently subject to higher-level review in the June 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Earlier Effective Date for a 70 Percent Rating for PTSD

The Veteran's PTSD has been rated as 30 percent disabling for the period prior to November 7, 2023, and 70 percent thereafter. 

He contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for the 70 percent rating, as the symptoms upon which the 70 percent award was based were also present prior to November 7, 2023, and as early as the date of the initial grant of service connection for PTSD. Following a review of the record, the Board agrees.

Generally, the effective date for an award of compensation is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(a). Additionally, in order to warrant a 70 percent rating for PTSD prior to November 7, 2023, the evidence must show occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

Importantly, the evidence considered in determining the level of impairment from PTSD under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 is not restricted to the symptoms listed in the General Rating Formula. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002). Instead, VA must consider all symptoms of a claimant's condition that affect the level of occupational and social impairment. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Here, the Board finds that the combination of PTSD symptoms and their overall impact on the Veteran's functioning during the period prior to November 7, 2023, warrant a higher 70 percent rating. Indeed, since the July 15, 2022, effective date of service connection for PTSD, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD has been productive of deficiencies in most areas.

In so finding, the Board first notes that the 70 percent rating was assigned based on a November 2023 VA examination during which the Veteran reported experiencing intrusive thoughts of what could happen, hypervigilance, and racing thoughts. He reported obsessive compulsions to wash his hands or use hand sanitizer frequently throughout the day. He reported poor sleep with nightmares, restlessness, and frequently awakening throughout the night. He stated he only sleeps well when he drinks. He reported avoidance of crowded places, little desire or interest in friendships, emotional numbness, and feeling disconnected from others. He reported feelings of guilt and little desire to do things he used to enjoy. He reported that he works out but finds it hard to motivate himself to go. He stated he did not typically have suicidal ideation but admitted to experiencing some thoughts from time to time. The VA examiner further noted that the Veteran's PTSD was productive of symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, chronic sleep impairment, flattened affect, disturbances in motivation and mood, suicidal ideation, and obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities.

Importantly, despite the initial August 2022 VA PTSD examination documenting far fewer symptoms, statements of the Veteran, his parents, a friend, and his wife received on October 5, 2023, competently and credibly relate that many of the foregoing signs and symptoms have been present and ongoing since the Veteran was discharged from active service in October 2014. 

In addition to supporting the competent statements of the Veteran and his wife, parents, and friend, the Board finds that the foregoing evidence demonstrates deficiencies in the areas of family, work, thinking, judgment, and mood during the period prior to November 7, 2023, such that a 70 percent rating is warranted during that period. Accordingly, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board assigns an earlier effective date of July 15, 2022, is warranted for the award of a 70 percent rating for PTSD. Furthermore, as the July 15, 2022, effective date is the date of receipt of claim and the effective date of service connection for PTSD, it is the earliest effective date assignable in this instance. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(a).

Earlier Effective Date for DEA Eligibility Under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35

Basic eligibility for DEA benefits for the child of a veteran is established if: (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

The Veteran has already been awarded entitlement to basic eligibility to DEA benefits as of November 7, 2023. However, given that the Board has granted an earlier effective date of July 15, 2022, for the award of a 70 percent disability rating for PTSD, the Veteran is now in receipt of a combined 100 percent evaluation since July 15, 2022. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran has established eligibility to DEA benefits beginning July 15, 2022; his claim, in this regard, is therefore granted, and the Board notes that this is the earliest possible date such eligibility can be granted and thus this is a full award of benefits sought in this regard. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.
