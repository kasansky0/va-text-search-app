REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 5, 2022, for a 70 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1989 to November 1991.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 higher-level review rating decision by the Regional Office (RO).  The Veteran filed an appeal to the Board by way of a June 2024 notice of disagreement (Form 10182) and elected Direct Review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

This case involves Direct Review by the Board of all of the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of a February 2023 rating decision, which was the subject of higher-level review by the June 2023 higher-level review rating decision that was appealed by the Veteran.  The Board is prohibited by law from considering any new evidence received after the issuance of the February 2023 rating decision on appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601(f), 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim to correct pre-decisional duty to assist error, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the post-remand adjudication of the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 5, 2022, for a 70 percent rating for PTSD is remanded.

A February 2023 rating decision granted an increased 70 percent rating, effective October 5, 2022.  The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the 70 percent rating.  See Supplemental claim, November 2022; Rating decision, February 2023; Request for higher-level review, March 2023; Rating decision, June 2023; Form 10182, June 2024.

With the Veteran's November 2022 supplemental claim seeking an increased rating for his PTSD, he submitted an October 2022 disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) completed by a private psychologist, Dr. D.H.  Because the October 2022 DBQ at least indicates that the Veteran's PTSD may have worsened, the Board finds that the duty to afford the Veteran a VA examination was triggered, but no opportunity for a new VA examination was provided before a decision was made on the claim by the February 2023 rating decision, which decision was later the subject of the higher-level review in June 2023.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran failed to report to a March 2019 VA examination, which was the basis of a rating reduction by an August 2019 rating decision.  Nonetheless, because the Veteran filed a November 2022 supplemental claim seeking an increased rating, with the new evidence consisting of the October 2022 DBQ showing symptoms not shown in the last VA examination in December 2016, the Board finds that it constituted pre-decisional duty to assist error for the RO to make a decision on the claim without first affording the Veteran an opportunity for a new VA examination to address the current severity of his PTSD.  

Moreover, the October 2022 DBQ from Dr. D.H. notes that the Veteran smokes "a lot" of marijuana, including at work at a medical center (in food service) and at home, and that it is a "less than ideal coping mechanism."  Because the Veteran reported smoking "a lot" of marijuana, the Board further finds that it is not readily apparent which symptoms in the October 2022 DBQ are attributable to the marijuana use, and which are attributable to the service-connected PTSD.  The Board further finds that it constituted pre-decisional error for the RO to make a decision on the claim without first seeking a medical opinion by a VA examiner to clarify, to the extent feasible, which symptoms noted in the October 2022 DBQ are attributable to marijuana use versus the service-connected PTSD.

Accordingly, the Board will remand the claim so that the Veteran may be afforded an opportunity for a new VA examination to address the current severity of the PTSD, and to address the October 2022 DBQ as discussed above.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule a new VA examination to address the current severity of the Veteran's service-connected PTSD.  The claims folder should be made available to the examiner, including a copy of this remand, and pertinent documents therein should be reviewed by the examiner.  A complete rationale for any opinions expressed should be provided.

Please ask the VA examiner to review an October 2022 DBQ (received in November 2022) and to clarify, to the extent feasible, which symptoms noted in the October 2022 DBQ are attributable to marijuana use versus diagnosed PTSD.

The examiner should also address the effect of the Veteran's PTSD on his occupational functioning and activities of daily living.
