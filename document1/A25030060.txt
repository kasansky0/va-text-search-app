DOCKET NO. 240614-448116
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

The motion to revise the June 2009 rating decision, in which an effective date of June 27, 2008, was assigned for the award of service connection for hepatocellular carcinoma, on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran died in September 2012; at the time of his death, he did not have any pending CUE motions.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

As the Appellant is not a proper claimant under 38 U.S.C. § 5109A, the motion to reverse or revise the June 2009 rating decision on the basis of CUE is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 20.204 (2024); Rusick v. Gibson, 760 F. 3d 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1951 to January 1960, and from April 1991 to February 1992. The Veteran died in September 2012. The Appellant is his surviving spouse. The Board sincerely thanks her for her husband's service.

This appeal to the Board arose from a February 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Appellant elected the Hearing docket. The requested hearing was conducted in October 2024 by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).  A transcript of the hearing is associated with the file.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.900 (c). 38 U.S.C.§ 7107 (a)(2).

In this current matter, the Appellant is seeking to revise the June 2009 rating decision, in which entitlement to service connection for hepatocellular carcinoma was awarded from June 27, 2008. The Appellant alleges that the AOJ committed CUE pertaining to the effective date assigned for the service connection award. In July 2023, she requested an earlier effective date for the award. In December 2023, the AOJ informed her she had to provide new and relevant evidence as to why the effective date should be any earlier. In response, the Appellant filed a CUE motion in January 2024. See January 2024 VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim Application). Prior to that, the Veteran had not filed a CUE motion pertaining to the June 2009 rating decision. 

The Veteran was notified of the June 2009 rating decision that same month. He did not timely initiate an appeal of the rating decision by submitting a notice of disagreement (NOD) or new and material evidence (the standard at the time) within one year of the notification of the rating decision pertaining to the effective date assigned for the service connection award. The Board notes that a NOD was filed pertaining to the issue of competency only. See June 2009 NOD. 

At the time of his death in September 2012, the Veteran did not have any pending CUE motions, nor had he raised any CUE allegations pertaining to the June 2009 rating decision. If he had, the Appellant could have substituted in his place to continue such an appeal. However, a survivor cannot initiate a freestanding CUE motion under section 5109A if the veteran had not already filed such a claim. Rusick v. Gibson, 760 F.3d 1342, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ("a survivor cannot initiate a freestanding CUE claim under section 5109A if the veteran had not already filed such a claim" even if a veteran dies after October 10, 2008, under 38 U.S.C.A. § 5121A); Haines v. West, 154 F.3d 1298, 1301-02, (Fed. Cir. 1998); Crews v. McDonough, No. 2021-2030 (Fed. Cir., March 16, 2023).

At present, no further action may be taken on this CUE motion. Here, the Veteran had not filed a CUE motion attacking the June 2009 rating decision by the time of his death. Therefore, the Appellant's instant CUE motion is a freestanding CUE motion. Pursuant to the holdings in Rusick, Crews, and Haines, supra, the Appellant does not have standing to bring such a CUE motion attacking the June 2009 rating decision that assigned an effective date of June 27, 2008, for the award of service connection for hepatocellular carcinoma.  The Board is very sympathetic to the Appellant's claim. However, the Board is bound by the laws and regulations pertaining to CUE claims. As the Appellant has no standing to bring the present CUE motion, unfortunately, this appeal must be dismissed. See 38 U.S.C. § 5109A.
