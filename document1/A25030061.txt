REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from August 2022 to September 2022.

The matter on appeal arises before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2023 rating decision.  In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a bladder condition is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for an adjustment disorder is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is remanded.

4. Entitlement to service connection for sleep disturbances is remanded.

In general, the consequences of a failure to report for a VA examination without good cause may include denial of the claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.158, 3.655. However, the record shows good cause for the Veteran's failure to appear in person for the examinations.  

Here, the Veteran was scheduled to appear for VA examinations for the claimed disabilities but did not appear in person for these examinations.  See May 2023 VA Exam Scheduling Request Contention Cancellation Notices.  Upon review of the claims file, the Board finds that the Veteran's address indicated in the requests scheduling the VA examinations, and subsequent recent VA communications, is different from the address he listed as his "preferred mailing address" in the December 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  See December 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (the Veteran provided a specific preferred mailing address).  The Board finds that this evidence shows a reasonable indication that the Veteran was not able to attend his examinations because he did not receive the notification letter for the examinations.  

Therefore, the claims must be remanded to the AOJ to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).  Upon remand, the Veteran should be notified for the scheduling of any new examinations using his preferred address, which is explicitly stated in the December 2023 VA Form 10182. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).    

Moreover, the examination scheduling information, including copies of the examination schedule notification letters that are sent to the Veteran, should be associated with the claims file.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for VA examinations to determine the nature and etiology of his claimed disabilities of a bladder condition, adjustment disorder, PTSD, and sleep disturbances. 

The claims file must be made available to the examiner for review of the case. All examination findings, along with the complete rationale for all opinions expressed, should be set forth in the examination report. All tests and studies deemed necessary should be conducted.

After reviewing the claims folder and examining the Veteran, the examiner is specifically instructed to provide the following information:

(a) Is it "at least as likely as not" that the Veteran's disability was incurred during or is otherwise related to his active-duty service, yes, or no?

The examiner must provide a supporting rationale for all opinions rendered.  

2. The Veteran should be notified for the scheduling of any new examinations through his preferred address, which is explicitly stated in the December 2023 VA Form 10182. Copies of the notice letters sent to the Veteran informing him of the time, place, and location of the examination must be associated with the Veteran's electronic claims file.

3. The notification letters should also inform the Veteran of the consequences of any failure to report for the examination without good cause. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.
