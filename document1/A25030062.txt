ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 26, 2003, for the assignment of a 20 percent disability rating for intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the lumbar spine is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 28, 2019, for the assigment of a 40 percent disability rating for residuals, surgery for recurrent dislocations, left shoulder is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's award of 20 percent for service-connected intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the lumbar spine is the date of the change in rating schedule regulation governing the evaluation of this condition and based on the application of law to the facts of the case here, is the earliest possible assignable effective date.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 26, 2003, for the assigment of a 20 percent disability rating for intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the lumbar spine have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1984 to October 1989.  For his meritorious service, the Veteran was awarded (among other decorations) the Army Achievement Medal.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued in January and February 2021 by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the March 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January and February 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to earlier effective date of an increased rating for a left shoulder disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).  

In a decision issued in June 2024, the Board denied the Veteran's claims for earlier effective date for increased rating for his service-connected low back and left shoulder disabilities.  The Veteran appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In January 2025, the Court issued an order granting a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) which vacated the Board's June 2024 decision and remanded this matter on appeal for adjudication consistent with the instructions outlined in the JMR.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 26, 2003, for the assignment of a 20 percent disability rating for intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the lumbar spine is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date of June 1, 2001, for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for his IVDS and DDD of the lumbar spine (low back disability).  

As noted above, this claim was the subject of a January 2025 JMR.  The parties determined that the Board erred when it failed to address how it relied on the February 2011 VA examination to determine September 26, 2003, reflected the proper date for the increased rating.  

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a), (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (a), (b).

The applicable effective date statute and regulations provide that the proper effective date for increased rating claims is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim for increased rating.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2). If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of the claim for increase.  Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).  The Federal Circuit reaffirmed that "the plain language of [section] 5110(b)(2) ... only permits an earlier effective date for increased disability compensation if that disability increased during the one-year period before the filing of the claim."  Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 983 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

In other words, if the increase became ascertainable more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the claim, then the proper effective date would be the date of claim.  In a case where the increase became ascertainable after the filing of the claim, then the effective date would be the date of increase.  See generally Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).  

In cases where the grant of compensation is based on a liberalized law, the effective date of the grant may generally not be earlier than the effective date of the change in law or the claim for benefits, whichever is earlier.  38 U.S.C. § 5510(g) provides that, "where compensation is awarded pursuant to any Act or administrative issue, the effective date of such award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the Act or administrative issue. In no event shall such award be retroactive for more than one year from the date of application therefor or the date of administrative determination of entitlement, whichever is earlier." "  The date of administrative determination of entitlement" is the date upon which VA makes its determination of entitlement to a benefit, i.e., the date of decision or liberalization and not the date the disability arose.  McCay v. Brown, 106 F.3d. 1577.

By way of history, on May 10, 2001, the Veteran submitted correspondence requesting an examination for his left shoulder and "other parts of my body."  In September 2003, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 9 claiming having issues with his left shoulder, lower back, knees, and feet.  See September 2003 VA Form 9.  A November 2003 letter was sent to the Veteran asking for clarification as to whether he sought to seek claims for the conditions listed in the September 2003 VA Form 9.  Subsequently, the Veteran submitted a November 2003 VA Form 21-4138 clarifying that he was seeking entitlement to a low back disability.  Service connection for a low back disability was denied in August 2006.  The Veteran filed the September 2006 notice of disagreement in response to the August 2006 denial.  

Subsequently, a Statement of the Case and Supplement Statement of the Case (SSOC) also denied service connection for service connection for a low back disability in May and December 2007, respectively.  A July 2008 Board decision remanded the Veteran's claim for service connection for a low back disability.  The June 2017 SSOC denied service connection for a low back disability.  Subsequently, the September 2017 Board decision remanded the claim of service connection for a low back disability.  The Veteran was afforded a November 2017 VA examination related to his low back.  The Veteran opted the appeal into the RAMP program in July 2018.  

A November 2019 rating decision granted service connection for a lumbosacral strain, effective May 10, 2001, and assigned a 10 percent rating, prior to September 26, 2003, and 20 percent, thereafter.  The rating decision noted that it was assigning a 20 percent rating from September 26, 2003, which corresponds to the effective date of rating schedular change. 

During the pendency of the appeal, the regulations for rating disabilities of the spine were revised, effective September 23, 2002, and effective September 26, 2003.  See 67 Fed. Reg. 54345 (Aug. 22, 2002); 68 Fed. Reg. 51454 (Aug. 27, 2003).  Pre-amendment DCs may be used throughout the appeal period if their application results in more favorable outcomes for the claimant.  Amended DCs may apply only from the effective date of the change.

Prior to September 26, 2003, the Veteran's rating under Diagnostic 5295, a strain with characteristic pain on motion, would warrant a 10 percent disability rating.  A strain with muscle spasm on extreme forward bending and loss of lateral spine motion in standing position would warrant a 20 percent disability rating.  Further, a severe strain with listing of whole spine to opposite side, positive Goldthwaite's sign, marked limitation of forward bending in standing position, loss of lateral motion with osteoarthritic changes, or narrowing or irregularity of joint space, or some of the above with abnormal mobility on forced motion would warrant a 40 percent disability rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5295 (2001).  

Effective September 26, 2003, the regulations for rating disabilities of the spine were revised, and the DCs were reclassified. These reclassified DCs contemplate various disabilities of the spine (found in DCs 5235 to 5242) under a General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (General Rating Formula) as well as DC 5243, which governs IVDS.  See 68 Fed. Reg. 51454 (Aug. 27, 2003).  The code for IVDS (DC 5243) permits evaluation under either the General Rating Formula or under the Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes, whichever results in the higher evaluation when all disabilities are combined under 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  

Under the General Rating Formula, a 20 percent rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  Id.

A 40 percent rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. A 50 percent rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  Id.

Alternatively, DC 5243 provides that a 10 percent rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes of IVDS having a total duration of at least one week but less than two weeks during the past 12 months; a 20 percent rating is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least two weeks but less than four weeks during the past 12 months; a 40 percent rating is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least four weeks but less than six weeks during the past 12 months; and a 60 percent rating is assigned in the event of incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least six weeks during the past 12 months.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71A, DC 5243.

Note (1) under DC 5243 defines an incapacitating episode as a period of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.  Id.  

Review of the medical evidence indicates that the Veteran has reported experiencing back pain dating back to 2003.  A VA examination in February 2011 diagnosed the Veteran with chronic lumbar syndrome with myotatic insufficiency and multi-segmental disc degeneration, however, the examination did not contain measurement needed to rate the disability for VA purposes.  The November 2017 VA examination found the Veteran exhibited forward flexion to 60 degrees.  

The evidence, prior to September 26, 2003, does not show that the Veteran's low back disability manifested in strain with muscle spasm on extreme forward bending and loss of lateral spine motion in standing position to warrant a 20 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5295.  The Board is also not able to apply the post-September 2003 diagnostic criteria the evidence, prior to September 26, 2003.  Moreover, if the Board was able to apply the post-September 2003 diagnostic criteria, the 20 percent rating would not be warranted for the Veteran's low back disability, as the evidence does not show forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  

Based on the Board's review of the record, the Board summarizes that the Veteran's 20 percent rating is based on findings in the November 2017 VA examination report.  Prior to the November 2017 VA examination, the record details a diagnosis of back condition with reports of pain and limits to functionality, but without the objective measures needed to rate the disability for VA purposes.  The RO awarded the Veteran a 20 percent rating, from September 26, 2003, based on findings from a 2017 VA examination.   

The currently assigned effective date of September 26, 2003, for the assignment of 20 percent rating, is, again, the date of the change in rating schedule regulation governing the evaluation of this condition and based on the application of law to the facts of the case here, is the earliest possible assignable effective date in this case.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.  Where compensation is awarded or increased pursuant to a liberalizing law, or a liberalizing VA issue approved by the Secretary or by the Secretary's direction, the effective date of such award or increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the act or administrative issue.

Although the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's appeal for an earlier effective date for the award of 20 percent rating for his service-connected low back disability, the Board is bound by the applicable statutes and regulations.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); 38 C.F.R. § 20.101(a).  Those laws and regulations provide specific guidance as to the documents on which effective dates may be based, and the fact that a disability or disabilities are of longstanding nature does not warrant a different result under these laws and regulations.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 28, 2019, for the assigment of a 40 percent disability rating for residuals, surgery for recurrent dislocations, left shoulder is remanded.

As noted above, this claim was the subject of a January 2025 JMR.  The parties determined that the Board erred when it failed to address the adequacy of the VA examinations in May 2003, May 2005, February 2011, October 2017, December 2018 and April 2019, addressing the severity of the Veteran's left shoulder disability considering the holdings in Sharp and DeLuca.  See Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26, 33 (2017), DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  

Essentially, the JMR highlighted that it is possible that the Veteran exhibited the criterion, unfavorable abduction limited to 25 degrees from the side of the minor shoulder joint, to warrant a 40 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5200 during periods of flare-ups, or due to pain, weakness, fatigue, and lack of endurance.  As such, a retrospective opinion is necessary to address the Veteran's functional loss due to flare-ups and other factors.  Thus, on remand, a retrospective medical opinion on his left shoulder for the appeal period (May 2003, May 2005, February 2011, October 2017, December 2018 and April 2019 VA examination reports) is necessary.  See Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80, 85 (2008).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an opinion as addressing the May 2003, May 2005, February 2011, October 2017, December 2018 and April 2019 VA examination findings considering Sharp, specifically describe the Veteran's report of left shoulder flare-ups in terms of either loss of range of motion or describe loss of function based on all procurable medical evidence the functional.  Whether an examination is needed prior to rendering this opinion is left to the discretion of the examiner.

The examiner should (a) offer a retrospective opinion as to all measurements required to evaluate the degree of disability for left shoulder disability for the period(s) on appeal, including the May 2003, May 2005, February 2011, October 2017, December 2018 and April 2019 VA examinations.

The examiner shall inquire as to periods of flare-ups and note the frequency and duration of any such flare-ups.  Any additional impairment on use or in connection with flare-ups should be described in terms of the degree of additional range of motion loss.  The examiner should specifically describe the severity, frequency, and duration of flare-ups; name the precipitating and alleviating factors; and estimate, per Veteran, to what extent, if any, such flare-ups affect functional impairment.

The VA examiner must consider the Veteran's reported symptomology during flare-ups in providing the requested opinions.

The Board asks the examiner to specifically provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's left shoulder disability manifested in unfavorable abduction limited to 25 degrees from the side, prior to April 28, 2019, during periods of flare-ups, or due to pain, weakness, fatigue, and lack of endurance.  

If unable to provide the requested retrospective testing, the examiner should state why and provide a reasoned explanation for the determination.
