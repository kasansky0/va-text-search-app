ORDER

Service connection for low back disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, it is at least as likely as not that his low back disability was caused or aggravated by his service-connected lower extremity disabilities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for low back disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2007 to April 2015.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for low back disability most recently addressed in a July 2022 rating decision.  In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.  

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.310.  Secondary service connection is provided for a disability that is caused or aggravated by a service-connected disease or disability. 38 C.F.R. § § 3.310 (a), (b). 

Low Back Disability

The Veteran contends his low back disability is due to his service-connected lower extremity disabilities. See April 2022 Statement in Support of Claim.

The Veteran's commissioning examination reports normal results. An August 20, 2010 service treatment record reports he experienced low back pain. See November 2015 Service Treatment Record.

The Veteran has been granted service connection for the lower extremity disabilities of left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome, right knee strain, and bilateral calcaneal spurs. 

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of low back degenerative arthritis. See May 2023 VA Examination.

The key inquiry is whether his disability is due to his service.

To that end, an April 2023 private examiner provided a positive nexus opinion that attributed the Veteran's low back disability to changes in his gait caused by his service-connected lower extremity disabilities. The examiner opined that the Veteran's gait pattern, with limping, resulted in unequal weight distribution on his lower extremities which hastened the development and progression of his low back disability.  This opinion reflects full consideration of the pertinent medical evidence of record and includes an adequate rationale for the opinion rendered with supporting data.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295 (2008). The Board assigns this opinion substantial probative weight.

The Board also considered an August 2023 VA examiner's negative nexus opinion which reported the Veteran's low back disability had not worsened since his August 20, 2010, in-service treatment. The examiner opined that the Veteran's lower extremities did not aggravate his low back disability because there was no record of chronic back pain before 2019. The rationale provided does not support the examiner's opinion and the opinion is internally inconsistent. For these reasons, the opinion is inadequate for adjudication.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).

Accordingly, as the April 2023 opinion is the only adequate medical evidence of record and relates the Veteran's low back disability to his service, the Board resolves all doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that service connection for low back disability is warranted.  38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.102; Gilbert, supra.  His appeal is granted.
