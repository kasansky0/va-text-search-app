ORDER

An earlier effective date than February 23, 2023, for the grant of service connection for lytic bone lesion, right fifth rib is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A claim for service connection for a rib lesion was not received within one year of the Veteran's March 1976 discharge. There are no informal or formal claims for service connection for a rib lesion dated prior to February 23, 2023.

2. The Veteran was diagnosed with lytic bone lesion, right fifth rib (cancer of the bone) on September 2, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date than February 23, 2023, for the grant of service connection for lytic bone lesion, right fifth rib have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant, had service from July 1973 to March 1976. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the claims file. Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, all the evidence submitted. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the Board must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence). The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claims. The appellant must not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran). The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence that it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive. Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence in the record; not every item of evidence has the same probative value.  

The Court has held that an appellant need only demonstrate that there is an "approximate balance of positive and negative evidence" in order to prevail. See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is not in equipoise, but nevertheless is in approximate balance.  An approximate balance of the evidence includes, but is not limited to equipoise. Evidence is not in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. When there is an approximate balance in the evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. An earlier effective date than February 23, 2023, for the grant of service connection for lytic bone lesion, right fifth rib.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date than February 23, 2023, for the grant of service connection for lytic bone lesion, right fifth rib.  Specifically, he stated in his April 2024 Notice of Disagreement that he was exposed to ionizing radiation during service and has tried since his discharge from service to "get service connection [for a] (TERA) event."

The Veteran's claim for service connection for "rib lesion" was received by VA on February 23, 2023.

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection based upon an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase is either the day following separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise it will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b).

A claim is a formal or informal communication, in writing, requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). VA amended its regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014).

Any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, from a claimant, his duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not sui juris, may be considered an informal claim. Such an informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year after the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155; Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413 (1999). 

The evidence of record indicates the Veteran's exposure to ionizing radiation, a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity, was conceded due to the Veteran's military occupational specialty noted on his December 1975 DD-214 and his separation examination which clearly noted that there was occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. Private treatment records show he was diagnosed with lytic bone lesion of the right fifth rib (a form of bone cancer) on September 2, 2022, a disability presumptively related to ionizing radiation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(d).

On review of the record, neither the Veteran nor the Board can point to any communication prior to the February 23, 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ that may serve as a claim for service connection for a rib lesion. While the Veteran filed a claim within a year of his separation, this claim was for a stomach disorder and did not include a claim for a rib disability. Accordingly, an effective date of the day following separation from active service is not warranted. A review of the record further reflects that while the Veteran previously filed written correspondence and claims pertaining to other disabilities, any prior claims filed by the Veteran did not reasonably encompass any rib disability, and it was not until his February 23, 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ that he expressed any intent to apply for service connection for a rib lesion. To the extent to which the Veteran seeks an earlier effective date as he had symptoms of the condition prior to the currently assigned effective date, it is not the presence of a disability that controls. The Court has long held that the mere presence of medical evidence does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for a disability. See Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999) ("[M]ere receipt of medical records cannot be construed as an informal claim."); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998) ("[T]he Board is not required to conjure up issues that were not raised by the appellant."). Accordingly, February 23, 2023, is the earliest effective date that can be assigned.
