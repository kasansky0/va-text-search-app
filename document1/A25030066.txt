REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The?Veteran?served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1984 to May 2000.  

The case is on appeal from a November 2022 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Dates

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received by VA within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). 

If a Veteran submits an intent to file a claim and VA receives a complete application form appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

Entitlement to an effective date of August 6, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy.

Here, the Veteran first applied for service connection for a back condition in December 2014.  That claim was denied in a July 2015 rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal that decision and it became final.

On August 6, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension or Survivors Pension and/or DIC.  On June 16, 2022, within one year of the intent to file, the Veteran submitted a new claim for benefits which sought service connection for degenerative disc disease.  On June 23, 2022, VA notified the Veteran that the claim for a back condition had been previously denied and thus, the claim could not be filed as a new claim but needed to be filed as a supplemental claim.  On October 27, 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim seeking service connection for his degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine.  On November 23, 2022, VA granted service connection for degenerative disc disease and the associated left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy effective October 27, 2022.  

The Board finds that although the Veteran filed a request to readjudicate his claim for service connection on the wrong form, received on June 16, 2022, he intended to request readjudication of his claim for service connection for a lumbar spine disability and indeed, utilized a form prescribed by the Secretary in doing so. While mindful of the Secretary's goal in requiring a specific form, the fact remains that the claimant may not have been aware of the difference between filing a new claim for benefits not previously denied, and a supplemental claim to readjudicate, when submitting a VA Form 21-526EZ versus a VA Form 20-0995. Both forms are intended to file claims for disability compensation.  See, e.g., Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  The Veteran then filed the correct form when notified by the AOJ as to the error; there is evidence of continuous pursuit of his claim, as he essentially filed the claim two times.

After careful consideration, the Board thus concludes that the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date of August 6, 2021, for the award of service connection for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease and the associated left lower extremity radiculopathy.  The June 16, 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ, as liberally construed by the Board, was submitted on a VA form as a means to readjudicate the finally decided issue of service connection for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease.  Further, the June 16, 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ was filed within one year of the August 6, 2021 VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension or Survivors Pension and/or DIC.

Accordingly, in compliance with VA laws and regulations regarding earlier effective dates for the award of service connection, entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 6, 2021, but no earlier, is granted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400.  

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. 

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505 (2007). Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Id. 

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that under the modernized appeals system, the?period on review?for an increased rating claim is the period from the date of the claim to the date of the decision on appeal.  Here, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension or Survivors Pension and/or DIC on August 6, 2021 and submitted his VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim on June 16, 2022.  Accordingly, the period on appeal for these claims is August 6, 2021, until November 23, 2022 (the date of the decision regarding these conditions). 

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease.

For the entire review period, the Veteran's lumbar spine degenerative disc disease with facet arthrosis has been rated as 40 percent disabling pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5010-5242.  38?C.F.R. §?4.71a.  In this regard, hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional diagnostic code is shown after the hyphen.  Here, the AOJ rated the Veteran's lumbar spine degenerative disc disease with facet arthrosis pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5010 for post-traumatic arthritis and 5242 for degenerative disc disease.  

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Id.  at Note 1.  

Unfavorable ankylosis is defined as "a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching."  Id.  at Note 5.  Additionally, fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) is "always" considered favorable ankylosis.  Id.  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  The spine has no opposite joint.

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

Upon examination in June 2022, the Veteran was found to have forward flexion to 25 degrees and extension to 15 degrees on active range of motion.  Passive range of motion was the same with pain noted in all ranges of motion.  Further, no additional loss of function was noted due to pain, weakness, fatiguability, or repetitive motion.  However, due to repeated use over time and flare ups, forward flexion was estimated to be 20 degrees and extension was estimated to be 10 degrees.  While there was localized tenderness and muscle spasm, it did not result in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour.  Muscle strength testing was normal for the right leg, however hip flexion, knee extension, ankle plantar flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and great toe extension were noted as 4/5 indicating active movement against some resistance.  Reflex and sensory examinations revealed normal reflexes and sensation in the right leg and hypoactive reflexes in the left leg with decreased sensation to the L3 through S1 nerves.  Straight leg test was positive for the left leg and the examiner noted mild constant pain, moderate intermittent pain, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and moderate numbness to the left leg.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease with facet arthrosis.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, repetitive use, pain during flare-ups, and pain during repetitive use over time.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements that the back would flare up daily for up to one hour, consisted of decreased range of motion, and were alleviated by rest, heat, and pain medication, would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  

Consideration has also been given to assigning a rating under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  However, the Veteran does not have IVDS and the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran was ever prescribed bed rest by a physician for a duration that meets the criteria for a higher rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease with facet arthrosis.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 40 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Regarding neurological impairment, the Veteran has already been granted service connection for left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy.  However, the June 2022 VA peripheral nerves condition examination shows the Veteran also has diagnoses of left lower extremity radiculopathy of the posterior tibial nerve and external popliteal nerve.  

In this regard, the examiner found that the Veteran's radiculopathies were manifested by mild symptoms. 

Paralysis of the posterior tibial nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8525.  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Complete paralysis of all muscles of sole of foot, frequently with painful paralysis of a causalgic nature; toes cannot be flexed; adduction is weakened; plantar flexion is impaired is rated as 30 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a.

Paralysis of the external popliteal nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8521.  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 30 disabling.  Complete paralysis, consisting of foot drop and slight droop of first phalanges of all toes, cannot dorsiflex the foot, extension (dorsal flexion) of proximal phalanges of toes lost; abduction of foot lost, adduction weakened; anesthesia covers entire dorsum of foot and toes is rated as 40 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a.  

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124. 

Furthermore, VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (Manual), though not binding on the Board, provides benchmarks for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe peripheral nerves conditions.  Per the Manual, mild incomplete paralysis is described as the disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area.  Additionally, a very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis. M21-1, V.iii.12.A.2.c. 

Moderate incomplete paralysis is described as the maximum evaluation reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment.  Symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category include: combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate.  Id. 

A moderately severe evaluation level includes motor and/or reflex impairment at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability, and potentially atrophy. To be described as severe, it would be expected that there is marked muscular atrophy.  Id. 

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28?Vet. App.?376 (2017). 

Here, the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy of the posterior tibial nerve and external popliteal nerve show mild to moderate sensory deficits with minimal reflex and motor abnormalities.  This is evidenced by muscle strength testing showing active movement against some resistance and hypoactive reflexes in the knee and ankle.  More severe symptoms such as muscle atrophy, trophic changes, or abnormal gait are absent.  As such, a moderate rating is warranted.  

Given the above, the Board finds that service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy of the posterior tibial nerve and the external popliteal nerve is warranted with a 20 percent rating assigned under Diagnostic Code 8521 and a 10 percent rating assigned Diagnostic Code 8525.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy.

The Veteran's left lower extremity sciatica is rated under Diagnostic Code 8520.  Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling.  Complete paralysis, in which the foot dangles and drops, there is no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, and flexion of the knee is weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. 

As previously indicated, the words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule; however, the definitions adopted by the Board previously in this decision continue to apply.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a 40 percent rating for his left lower extremity sciatica.   

For the reasons that follow, the evidence persuasively shows that the Veteran's left lower extremity sciatica manifested in moderate incomplete paralysis, corresponding to the criteria for a 20 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 8520. 

The Board acknowledges that the June 2022 VA examiner concluded that the Veteran had mild incomplete paralysis of the left sciatic nerve, which corresponds with a 10 percent evaluation.  However, the examiner also noted symptoms that are more indicative of moderate incomplete paralysis.  The examiner explained that the Veteran had moderate intermittent pain, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and moderate numbness of the left lower extremity.  Additionally, the examiner noted decreased sensation of the feet and toes.  Therefore, entitlement to an initial disability rating of 20 percent for left lower extremity sciatica was granted. 38?C.F.R. §?4.124a. 

However, a disability rating in excess of 20 percent is not appropriate. The VA examiner did not opine that the Veteran's sciatica symptoms were moderately severe or worse. Furthermore, the Veteran had no muscle atrophy, no trophic changes, and his gait was normal.  As such, entitlement to a 40 percent disability rating for left lower extremity sciatica is not warranted. 

(continued on next page)?

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected by this decision. Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.
