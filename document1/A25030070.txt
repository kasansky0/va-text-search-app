DOCKET NO. 220810-266850
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of service connection for sinusitis is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On September 5, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran's authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  In the present case, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  See September 2024 statement in support of claim.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
