REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2011 to January 2015. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2022 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The rating decisions considered the evidence of record on that date.  The Veteran timely appealed these decisions to the Board by requesting the AMA Direct Review docket for a reevaluation of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In the AMA decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) made binding favorable findings.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Duties to Notify and Assist

The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations impose obligations on VA to provide claimants with notice and assistance.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).

In the VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Veteran declined a Board hearing.

The Veteran's representative submitted an August 2023 Informal Hearing Presentation (IHP).

The Veteran in this case has not referred to any deficiencies in either the duties to notify or assist; therefore, the Board may proceed to the merits of the claim.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015, cert denied, U.S.C. Oct. 3, 2016) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board....to search the record and address procedural arguments when the [appellant] fails to raise them before the Board"); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to an appellant's failure to raise a duty to assist argument before the Board).

The Board has reviewed all of the evidence in the Veteran's claims file.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no requirement that the evidence submitted by the Veteran or obtained on his behalf be discussed in detail.  Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) and Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-130 (2000).

The Board incorporates the history in the section above by reference.

Only an appellant, or an appellant's authorized representative, may withdraw an appeal. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 19.55 (a).  Appeal withdrawals must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf), the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety, or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 19.55 (b)(1).  Withdrawal of an appeal will be deemed a withdrawal of the Notice of Disagreement and, if filed, the Substantive Appeal, as to all issues to which the withdrawal applies. Withdrawal does not preclude filing a new Notice of Disagreement and, after a Statement of the Case is issued, a new Substantive Appeal, as to any issue withdrawn, provided such filings would be timely under these rules if the appeal withdrawn had never been filed.  38 C.F.R. § 19.55 (c).  The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees.  38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d).

Recently, by way of a December 2024 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran informed the Board that he wished to withdraw the instant appeal currently before the Board.  The Veteran provided his contact information and wrote, "I would like to cancel my appeal that is currently pending with the Board of Veteran's Appeals docket number 230720-364413."  An additional sentence reflects the Veteran's understanding that he would have to apply again for any new benefits surrounding these claims.  The Veteran signed the form and dated it on December 9, 2024.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review these issues on appeal.  Therefore, these issues on appeal are dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 19.55.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).  The instant appeals are withdrawn.
