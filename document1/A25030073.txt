ORDER

Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for a left hip disability prior to March 30, 2015, is denied.

Prior to March 30, 2015, a separate 10 percent evaluation under DC 5253 for impairment of the left thigh due to limitation of rotation is warranted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.	Prior to March 30, 2015, the Veteran's left hip disability was not manifested by flexion of the left thigh limited to 30 degrees or less.

2.	Prior to March 30, 2015, the Veteran's left hip disability was also manifested by limitation of rotation of the left thigh that resulted in inability to toe out more than 15 degrees of the left leg.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left hip disability prior to March 30, 2015, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.27, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5252, 5255.

2. The criteria for a separate 10 percent evaluation, but not higher, under DC 5253 for impairment of the left thigh have been met prior to March 30, 2015. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.27, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5253.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1989 to September 1993.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2021 higher-level review rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In the February 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2020 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. The percentage ratings represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making a disability determination. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where service connection has already been established, and increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of the disability that is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). However, in Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999), it was held that evidence to be considered in the appeal of an initial assignment of a disability rating was not limited to that reflecting the then current severity of the disorder. The Court also discussed the concept of the "staging" of ratings, finding that, in cases where an initially assigned disability evaluation has been disagreed with, it was possible for a veteran to be awarded separate percentage evaluations for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period. See also Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2008).

The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant. Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value. According to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021), the proper standard of review is whether the factors are in an "approximate balance." Lynch held that the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in an approximate balance, i.e., nearly equal and does not require the evidence to be in exact equipoise. Id.

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In this case, the Veteran is competent to testify on factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge. Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005). He is also competent to report symptoms of his left hip disability. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994). The Veteran is competent to describe his symptoms and their effects on employment or daily activities.

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.40. Functional loss may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior in undertaking the motion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 (discussing facial expressions such as wincing, muscle spasm, crepitation, etc.). Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled. Excess fatigability and incoordination should be taken into account in addition to more movement than normal, less movement than normal, and weakened movement. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45.

The intent of the schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability. It is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. Although the first sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 refers only to arthritis, the regulation applies to joint conditions other than arthritis. Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 3-5 (2011).

In evaluating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, it is necessary to consider, along with the schedular criteria, functional loss due to flare-ups of pain, fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, and weakness. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).

Although pain may cause functional loss, pain itself does not constitute functional loss. Rather, pain must affect some aspect of "the normal working movements of the body," such as "excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance," in order to constitute functional loss. Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 38-43 (2011) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40).

Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for a left hip condition prior to March 30, 2015, is denied.

The Veteran, through his attorney, contends that he is entitled to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent, prior to March 30, 2015, for his left hip condition. Specifically, the attorney contends that he is entitled to a 20 percent disability rating, under diagnostic code (DC) 5255. See February 2022 VA Form 10182. Notably, the Veteran does not take issue with remaining staged ratings issued in the February 2021 AOJ decision.

The Veteran currently has a 10 percent evaluation, from February 24, 2009, under DCs 5003-5252.

Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. DC 5003 provides that degenerative arthritis that is established by X-ray findings will be rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Under Diagnostic Code 5252, a 10 percent rating is assigned for hip flexion limited to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. A 20 percent rating is assigned for hip flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is assigned for hip flexion limited to 20 degrees. A maximum 40 percent rating is assigned for hip flexion limited to 10 degrees. Id.

While portions of the rating schedule addressing the musculoskeletal system were revised effective February 7, 2021, the amendments did not change the criteria under Diagnostic Code 5252.

Notably, the criteria for impairment of the femur under Diagnostic Code 5255 have changed during the period covered by this appeal, effective February 7, 2021. See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76463 (Nov. 30, 2020) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5255).

If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g). If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. 38 U.S.C. § 5110. Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claim under the old criteria prior to February 7, 2021, and both the old and new rating criteria from February 7, 2021. The criteria that is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied.

Diagnostic Code 5255 pertains to impairment of the femur. Prior to the regulatory change, malunion of the femur with slight knee or hip disability warrants a 10 percent evaluation; with moderate knee or hip disability warrants a 20 percent evaluation; or with marked knee or hip disability warrants a 30 percent evaluation. Fracture of the surgical neck of the femur with false joint warrants a 60 percent evaluation. Fracture of the shaft or anatomical neck of the femur with nonunion, without loose motion, weightbearing preserved with the aid of a brace warrants a 60 percent evaluation. Fracture of the shaft or anatomical neck of the femur with nonunion, with loose motion (spiral or oblique fracture), warrants an 80 percent evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5255.

Diagnostic Code 5255 contemplates impairment of the femur. Prior to the regulatory change, malunion of the femur warrants a 10 percent rating with slight knee or hip disability, a 20 percent rating with moderate knee or hip disability, and 30 percent rating with marked knee or hip disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

As of February 7, 2021, the new regulation revises the rating criteria for Diagnostic Code 5255 regarding malunion of the femur. The revised rating stated that malunion of the femur should be evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 5256, 5257, 5260, or 5261 for the knee, or 5250-5254 for the hip, whichever results in the highest evaluation. The Board notes that Diagnostic Codes 5250 through 5254 and 5255 regarding impairment of the femur remain unchanged.

Words such as "severe," "moderately," and "markedly" are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all evidence, to the end that decisions will be equitable and just. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, it is not dispositive of an issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.100 (a) (delegating the Secretary's authority "to make findings and decisions as to the entitlement of claimants to benefits" to, inter alia, VA "adjudicative personnel"); 38 C.F.R. § 4.2 ("It is the responsibility of the rating specialist to interpret reports of examination so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present."). Instead, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding a request for a higher disability rating. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6. Additionally, the use of the phrase "such as" in diagnostic codes reflects that the terms following the phrase are examples and not an exclusive list. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002).

Normal ranges of motion of the hip include hip flexion from 0 to 125 degrees, hip extension from 0 to 30 degrees, hip abduction from 0 to 45 degrees, hip adduction from 0 to 25 degrees, hip external rotation from 0 to 60 degrees, and hip internal rotation from 0 to 40 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

Factual Background and Analysis

During the relevant period (prior to March 30, 2015), the Veteran did not undergo a VA examination in connection with his left hip disability. As such, the relevant private medical evidence is discussed below. 

A medical report from June 2010 noted that the left hip had "flexion to about 120 degrees, external rotation 30 degrees and internal rotation 10 [degrees] with mild pain." See June 2010 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 1. The physician also noted that the Veteran reported increased left hip achiness over the years that, at that time, occasionally limited his activity. Id. The Veteran also reported episodes of pain but noted that he has frequent times where he has minimal-to no pain. Id. 

Additionally, a June 2010 x-ray report noted that the left hip did not show any fractures or dislocation. Id. at 3. Further, additional imaging showed left hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis. Id. at 4-5. The medical record also noted "[t]here is slightly T2 signal at the head of the left femur, suggestive of reactive marrow edema."  Id. at 5. The report provides an impression of "fraying of the left anterior superior acetabular labrum," "left posterior superior acetabular labral tear with adjacent paralabral cyst," and "left hip dysplasia and moderate left acetabular femoral joint ostearthritis." Id. 

July 2010 medical records noted that recent x-rays and MRIs showed severe left hip dysplasia with degenerative changes, confirmed with tearing of his labrum. See July 2010 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 3. On examination, a July 2010 medical record noted that the Veteran "can flex to approximately 90 degrees with limited internal and external rotation as well as limited abduction. He has limb length discrepancy with his left leg being approximately 1.5cm shorter than contralateral side." Id. 

A May 2012 medical record noted that the Veteran had left hip "flexion to about 100, pain with any rotation, which is markedly limited, 0 [degrees] internal with only about 10 degrees external. See October 2013 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 18.

An October 2013 medical record noted that, on examination, the Veteran had left hip flexion to 110 degrees and marked decreased rotation. Id. at 16.

An October 2014 medical record noted that, on examination of the left hip, the Veteran had "significant stiffness to the hip with groin pain. He has hip flexion to about 75 degrees. His internal and external rotation is about 15 degrees with both, it is extremely decreased as compared to his right hip motion. He walks with a limp. He has good straight leg raise ability with good quad tone. He has minimal tenderness over the greater trochanteric region palpation. Id. at 13.

Flexion

As noted above, the Veteran currently has a 10 percent disability rating for his left hip disability (from February 24, 2009, to March 30, 2015), under Diagnostic Codes 5003-5252. The AOJ noted that the Veteran was assigned a compensable rating based on painful motion of the hip, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, which allows consideration of functional loss due to painful motion to be rated at least the minimum compensable rating for a particular joint.

In this instance, the Board does not find that a rating in excess of 10 percent is warranted for the Veteran's right hip limitation of flexion disability.

Notably, under Diagnostic Code 5252, a 20 percent rating is warranted for limitation of flexion of the thigh to 30 degrees.

Specifically, a June 2010 record noted that the Veteran's left hip flexion was limited to 120 degrees; a July 2010 record indicated that the Veteran's flexion was limited to 90 degrees; a May 2012 medical record noted the Veteran's flexion was limited to 100 degrees; an October 2013 record noted that the Veteran's flexion was limited to 110 degrees; and an October 2014 medical record noted that the Veteran's flexion was limited to about 75 degrees. 

Additionally, there is no competent evidence of record that demonstrates that the Veteran has loss of motion to a degree required by a rating in excess of 10 percent. 

As a result, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence is against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for left hip limitation of flexion.

Impairment of the Femur

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a 20 percent evaluation under DC 5255.

As noted above, DC 5255, prior to the regulatory change, malunion of the femur warrants a 10 percent rating with slight knee or hip disability, a 20 percent rating with moderate knee or hip disability, and 30 percent rating with marked knee or hip disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

As of February 7, 2021, the new regulation revises the rating criteria for Diagnostic Code 5255 regarding malunion of the femur. The revised rating stated that malunion of the femur should be evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 5256, 5257, 5260, or 5261 for the knee, or 5250-5254 for the hip, whichever results in the highest evaluation.

The Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to a rating under either version of Diagnostic Code 5255. As a threshold matter, the record does not reflect that the Veteran has fractured his left femur, nor does it show that he has malunion of the left femur. 

The Veteran is also not entitled to a rating under the revised Diagnostic Code 5255 for malunion of the femur. The evidence of record does not show that he has malunion of the left femur or fracture of shoft or anatomical neck of the femur with nonunion, nor does he have ankylosis of the left hip (Diagnostic Code 5250), flail hip joint (Diagnostic Code 5253), or left hip with limitation of extension of the thigh (Diagnostic Code 5251), and he is already rated for his left hip disability with painful motion (Diagnostic Code 5252). He is therefore not entitled to ratings under Diagnostic Code 5255 based on malunion of the femur. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5255.

In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the assertions of the Veteran and his attorney as to the Veteran's symptomatology and the severity of his condition, but to the extent the Veteran believes that he is entitled to a higher rating than assigned herein, concludes that the available medical records are more probative than his assertions to that effect.  

Separate 10 percent rating for limitation of rotation of the left thigh

The Board finds a separate rating under DC 5253 is warranted prior to March 30, 2015, based on medical evidence of limitation of rotation of the left thigh that prevented the left leg from toe-out more than 15 degrees.

As discussed above, a July 2010 medical record found the left leg had limited internal and external rotation and a May 2012 medical record observed pain with any rotation that was described as markedly limited to include about 10 degrees external rotation of the left leg. See October 2013 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 18. An October 2014 medical record measured external rotation of about 15 degrees. Resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, the record reflects the criteria for a 10 percent evaluation under DC 5253 have been met prior to March 30, 2015. There is no indication that abduction was limited beyond 10 degrees to warrant a higher evaluation under that Diagnostic Code. As such, a separate 10 percent evaluation, but not higher, is granted prior to March 30, 2015. 

In reaching its decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran is entitled to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for his left hip disability under DC 5252 or 5255 prior to March 30, 2015, that doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. In addition, a separate evaluation of 10 percent, but not higher, is granted under DC 5253 prior to March 30, 2015.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
