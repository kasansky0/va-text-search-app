DOCKET NO. 231021-386150
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for a compensable disability rating for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On September 25, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received notification from the appellant requesting a withdrawal of this appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This case comes to the Board on appeal from a July 2023 decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that in pertinent part, granted service connection and a noncompensable rating for bilateral hearing loss.

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket, and appealed for a higher disability rating for service-connected bilateral hearing loss.  However, before the Veteran's hearing could be scheduled, he withdrew his appeal in a September 2024 statement.  See September 2024 VA Form 21-4138.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
