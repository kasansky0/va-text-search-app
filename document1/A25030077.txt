DOCKET NO. 220407-340406
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

Eligibility for educational assistance benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 30 Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30 or MGIB) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record shows the Veteran had separate periods of service to qualify for education benefits under the MGIB and Post-9/11 GI Bill.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility for educational assistance benefits under the MGIB are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (18), 3011(a)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.13 (c), 21.7042 (a), 21.9520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2009 to January 2017.

In February 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting to reinstate her Chapter 30 education benefits. A February 2022 letter denied the education claim, finding the Veteran made an irrevocable election to Chapter 33 benefits that may not be changed. In March 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), requesting review of the February 2022 decision. A March 2022 decision letter denied the claim, finding the February 2022 decision was correct. A March 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealed the decision and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Eligibility for education benefits under Chapter 30 MGIB

In March 2021, the Veteran applied for VA education benefits (VA Form 22-1990) requesting Chapter 33 in Lieu of Chapter 30 benefits, effective July 15, 2021. In January 2022, the Veteran applied for VA education benefits (VA Form 22-1990) requesting Chapter 30 benefits, effective January 20, 2022. 

VA denied the request to use Chapter 30 MGIB education benefits, finding the Veteran made an irrevocable election from Chapter 30 to Chapter 33 education benefits. The Veteran appealed the denial of Chapter 30 benefits.

The law provides that individuals entitled to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33 who are also eligible for educational assistance under Chapter 30, among other programs, "may not receive assistance under two or more such programs concurrently but shall elect (in such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe) under which chapter or provisions to receive educational assistance." 38 U.S.C. § 3322(a). The law prohibits duplication of eligibility based on a single event or period of service. 38 U.S.C. § 3322 (h)(1). Specifically, the law states that "[a]n individual with qualifying service in the Armed Forces that establishes eligibility on the part of such individual for educational assistance under [chapter 33], chapter 30 or 32 of this title, and chapter 1606 or 1607 of title 10, shall elect (in such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe) under which authority such service is to be credited." Id. This law was due to amendments enacted by Congress, effective August 1, 2011. See Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-377, § 111, 124 Stat. 4106, 4120-21 (Jan. 4, 2011).

Pertinent to this appeal, the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) recently held that servicemembers who, through separate periods of service, accrue educational benefits under both the MGIB and Post-9/11 GI Bill may use either one, in any order, up to a maximum of 36 months of either program with an aggregate limit of 48 months. Rudisill v. McDonough, 144 S. Ct. 945 (2024). 

The Board finds the evidence of record shows the Veteran had separate periods of service to qualify for education benefits under the MGIB and Post-9/11 GI Bill. 

Looking to the eligibility requirements for Chapter 30, an individual may establish basic eligibility for educational assistance under the MGIB by showing he or she first entered into active duty as a member of the armed forces after June 30, 1985, and served at least three years of continuous active duty if the obligated period of active duty was three years or more. 38 U.S.C. § 3011 (a)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 21.7042(a).

Looking to the eligibility requirements for Chapter 33, an individual may establish eligibility for basic educational assistance under the Post-9/11 GI Bill by showing active duty service after September 10, 2001, with a minimum of 90 aggregate days excluding entry level and skill training. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 101 (18), an individual who enlisted or reenlisted before completion of a period of active service may establish eligibility for VA benefits if he or she satisfactorily completed the period of active service for which he or she was obligated at the time of entry.

The VA website, Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) page, states when determining whether a veteran has two or more qualifying periods of active duty service for education benefit purposes, any reenlistment is considered a separate period of active duty. https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/ (last visited April 1, 2025).

In this appeal, the Veteran's DD-214 shows active duty service in the U.S. Air Force from April 2009 to January 2017. Personnel records show a March 2009 initial enlistment agreement for 4 years and a subsequent reenlistment agreement for 3 years and 9 months. VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR) reports show additional qualifying active service in the Air Force National Guard from June 27, 2018 to August 15, 2018 (50 days) and October 18, 2017 to December 9, 2017 (53 days).

Under Rudisill, considering the Veteran's reenlistment during Air Force active duty service or additional qualifying active service in the Air Force National Guard, the evidence shows more than one period of qualifying service to warrant education benefits under MGIB and Post 9/11 GI Bill.

Accordingly, the Veteran is separately eligible for educational assistance benefits under the MGIB. The appeal is granted.
