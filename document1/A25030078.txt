DOCKET NO. 240108-407344
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis (claimed as PACT Act (Toxins) and breathing symptoms) on a direct basis and as presumptive to Burn Pit and other Toxins (BPOT) is denied. 

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder stain is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for left wrist sprain is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for overuse disorder left hand ring finger is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for overuse disorder right hand ring finger is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

1.  The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had sinusitis at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for sinusitis (claimed as PACT Act (Toxins) and breathing symptoms) on a direct and as presumptive to Burn Pit and other Toxins (BPOT) are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 2003 to February 2004 and May 2010 to June 2011. He was awarded the Army Achievement Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, and Iraq Campaign Medal, among others.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2023 and November 2023 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In October 2022 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of left shoulder strain, overuse disorder of the left-hand ring finger, overuse disorder right hand and left wrist pain most recently addressed in an August 2022 rating decision. In July 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal.

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of left shoulder strain, left hand overuse, right hand overuse and left wrist strain, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection for Sinusitis. 

The Veteran contends that he has sinusitis that should be presumptively service connected through the PACT Act. Alternatively, the Veteran contends that he has sinusitis that should be directly service connected. 

Pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), exposure to burn pits and other toxins (BPOT) is presumed for "covered veterans," i.e., those who served in specific locations on or after specific dates. 38 U.S.C. § 1119. Any veteran who, on or after August 2, 1990, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in and/or airspace above Bahrain; Iraq; Kuwait; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Somalia; the United Arab Emirates; the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia; the Gulf of Aden; the Gulf of Oman; the Persian Gulf; the Arabian Sea; or the Red Sea will be presumed BPOT exposed, as will any veteran who, on or after September 11, 2001, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in and/or airspace above Afghanistan; Djibouti; Egypt; Jordan; Lebanon; Syria; Yemen; or Uzbekistan. 38 U.S.C. § 1119; VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 7, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022). Certain diseases will be presumed related to service for veterans with in-service toxic exposure, including BPOT exposure. 38 U.S.C. § 1120.

Here, the Veteran is a "covered veteran" with presumed BPOT exposure under 38 U.S.C. § 1119. As such, presumptive service connection will be warranted for diseases enumerated in 38 U.S.C. § 1120. However, the Veteran is not currently diagnosed with any diseases on this list. 38 U.S.C. § 1119. Therefore, presumptive service connection due to BPOT exposure is not warranted under 38 U.S.C. § 1120. 

Additionally, while service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3. 303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Thus, the question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of sinusitis and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The November 2023 VA examiner determined that, while the Veteran experienced subjective symptoms of sinus pressure and pain, the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of sinusitis. Further, private treatment records do not contain a diagnosis of sinusitis and rather show that the Veteran has clear sinuses. See C&P Exam November 2023. Finally, in the Burn Pit registry evaluation, the Veteran stated he had no sinus pain or tenderness. See CAPRI August 2023.

The Board has also considered the holding in Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), in which the Federal Circuit held that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."  Id. at 1367-69. However, there is no evidence of record that the Veteran is experiencing a functional impairment of earning capacity due to sinus pain or pressure. 

While the Veteran believes he has a current diagnosis of sinusitis, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence and service connection for sinusitis must be denied. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Left shoulder strain. 

Left wrist sprain. 

Overuse disorder left hand ring finger. 

Overuse disorder right hand ring finger. 

Unfortunately, there were pre-decisional duty to assist errors and a failure to obtain adequate medical opinions on these issues. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R.§ 20.802(a). The Board does not have enough information to conclude if these disabilities were caused by or aggravated by service. The Veteran attended his VA examinations and while the examinations are thorough in their discussion of toxic exposures, they do not directly address the Veteran's main contention as to the root cause of his joint pain.

Because the examiners never addressed a key contention by the Veteran that his work offloading and loading boxes full of mail bags that weigh between twenty and sixty pounds every day for 10-12 hours a day caused his joint pain, new opinions are needed. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (finding that "[i]t is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion, not the mere fact that the claims file was reviewed, that contributes probative value to a medical opinion").

Regrettably the Board lacks enough information to decide these matters and they must be remanded for new examinations which address the Veteran's contentions. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a new medical opinion for the Veteran's left shoulder strain in which the examiner opines whether or not the Veteran's left shoulder stain was caused or aggravated by his work lifting mail bags in service. 

2. Obtain a new medical opinion for the Veteran's left wrist sprain in which the examiner opines whether or not the Veteran's left wrist sprain was caused or aggravated by his work lifting mail bags in service.

3. Obtain a new medical opinion for the Veteran's overuse disorder left ring finger in which the examiner opines whether or not the Veteran's overuse disorder left ring finger was caused or aggravated by his work lifting mail bags in service.

4. Obtain a new medical opinion for the Veteran's overuse disorder right ring finger in which the examiner opines whether or not the Veteran's overuse disorder left ring finger caused or aggravated by his work lifting mail bags in service.
