ORDER

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss (BHL) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's BHL began in service and has been present since. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for BHL are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1154(b), 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service with the United States Army from June 1962 through May 1965 and from July 1965 through July 1968. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), hereinafter the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied service connection for BHL.  The Veteran filed a Board Appeal:  Notice of Disagreement, VA Form 10182, in March 2025, in which the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. As such, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the decision on appeal (October 15, 2024). The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the issuance of the decision on appeal (on or after October 16, 2024). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

As an initial matter, the Board notes the time afforded the Veteran to switch appellate dockets, pursuant to Williams, has not yet expired and no waiver of the right to switch dockets has been received at this time. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). However, the Board finds that adjudicating the matter on the merits, notwithstanding the lack of such waiver, is of no prejudice to the Veteran as the Board is granting the full benefit sought on appeal. 

As a final initial matter, the Board points out that the October 2024 rating decision on appeal found that no new and relevant evidence had been received sufficient to readjudicate the Veteran's claim for service connection for BHL. However, the AOJ continued to adjudicate the claim on the merits, which constitutes an implicit finding of new and relevant evidence. The Board is therefore bound by this favorable finding. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Board will therefore proceed to adjudicate the merits of the claim for service connection for BHL.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Where a veteran served 90 days or more of active service, and those certain chronic diseases become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. Id.

For purposes of applying VA laws, impaired hearing is considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Sensorineural hearing loss (an "organic disease of the nervous system") is considered by VA to be a "chronic disease" listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); therefore, 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) applies. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Accordingly, service connection for sensorineural hearing loss may be established on a presumptive basis by showing that it manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), where the evidence shows an enumerated "chronic disease" in service (or within the presumptive period under § 3.307), or "continuity of symptoms" of such a disease after service, the disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service. Walker, 708 F.3d at 1335-1337.

The failure to meet hearing loss criteria at the time of a Veteran's separation from active service is not necessarily a bar to service connection for hearing loss disability. A Veteran "may nevertheless establish service connection for a current hearing loss disability by submitting evidence that the current disability is related to service." Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 159-60; see 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

In any case where a veteran is engaged in combat in active service during a period of war, campaign, or expedition, lay or other evidence of service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury related to combat will be considered sufficient proof of service connection if consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service, notwithstanding the fact that there is no official record of such incurrence during service, and, to that end, VA shall resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 1154(b). Service connection of such disease may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.

In Reeves v. Shinseki the higher U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit Court) held that the combat presumption contained within 38 U.S.C. § 1154(b) [and the implementing VA regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(d)] not only applied to a combat injury, but also the consequences of that injury, at least in service. Reeves v. Shinseki, 682 F.3d 988, 999 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (holding that the Board was required to apply the section 1154(b) presumption to the Veteran's claimed acoustic trauma during service and the separate question of whether he suffered permanent hearing loss while on active duty). Therefore, the Board must determine whether 38 U.S.C. § 1154(b) establishes the onset of BHL during or as a consequence of the Veteran's service. See Id.

At the outset, the Veteran's DD-214 lists the Veteran's Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) as an Executive Chef. However, the Veteran has reported in his July 2024 Statement in Support of Claim that he engaged in combat and was exposed to rocket and mortar fire as well as small arms fire. He also stated in his August 2011 Statement in Support of Claim that as part of a light tank company he escorted conveys from place to place and during such escorts the "big guns" were almost constantly firing. Further, the AOJ, in its October 2024 rating decision, made a favorable finding that the Veteran served in a combat zone in Vietnam in 1967. The Board is bound by this finding. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). As such, the Veteran's reports of exposure to hazardous noise are consistent with the circumstances of his service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  Therefore, the Board concedes that an in-service event is present in this case.

The Board also notes the AOJ, in its October 2024 rating decision, made the favorable finding that the Veteran has BHL. See August 2024 VA Audiological Examination; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The Board is equally bound by this determination.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Accordingly, the first two elements are met in this case.  The sole issue left is the nexus element.  In this regard, the Board finds there is a nexus in this case.  

Accordingly, this case turns on whether there is a nexus to service. The Board finds that there is.

Although the Board acknowledges the August 2024 VA examiner's opinion that the Veteran's BHL was not related to military service, the Board finds that those opinions are of no probative value as the basis of the examiner's conclusion was that the Veteran had normal hearing at entrance and exit from service, with minimal change in decibel loss during service.  As noted above, the lack of any hearing loss during service is not fatal to a claim for service connection.  See Hensley, supra.  Further, the examiner does not address the Veteran's noise exposure during service; rather, the entirety of the opinion is based on the lack of documentation during service.   See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (examination was inadequate where the examiner did not comment on the appellant's report of in-service injury and instead relied on the absence of evidence in the service medical records to provide a negative opinion.) As such, the Board finds that the opinion has no probative value.  See Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467 (1993) (the probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion the physician reaches.); Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998) (the failure of the physician to provide a basis for his/her opinion affects the weight or credibility of the evidence).

The sole evidence left with regards to next is the Veteran's lay statements.  In this regard, the Veteran reported that his hearing loss began during service in Vietnam, and that there has been continuity of symptoms since service. See August 2011 Statement Support of Claim; see also August 2024 VA medical examination. Although the Veteran is not qualified and/or competent to render a diagnosis, he is competent and qualified to report his symptoms.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting general competence to testify as to symptoms but not to provide medical diagnosis); see also Jones v. West, 12 Vet. App. 383, 385 (1999) (where the determinative issue is one of medical causation or a diagnosis, only those with specialized medical knowledge, training, or experience are competent to provide evidence on the issue).  In this regard, the Board finds this evidence to be highly competent, credible and probative.  

Accordingly, the probative evidence in this case demonstrates incurrence of hearing loss during service.  As such, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted based on the evidence of record in this case and considerable in this appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  In so reaching that conclusion, the Board has appropriately applied the benefit of the doubt doctrine in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
