FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On February 22, 2022, a Demand Letter was sent to the Appellant advising her of a debt.  The letter stated that she could request a waiver of the recovery of the debt within 180 days.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Appellant's request for a waiver of recovery of the overpayment of apportionment benefits is timely.  38 U.S.C. § 5302(a); 38 C.F.R. § 1.963(b)(2).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 2002 to June 2004.  The Appellant is his estranged spouse who was in receipt of apportionment benefits while the custodial parent of their son.

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 Decision on Waiver of Indebtedness issued by the Committee on Compromises and Waivers (Committee), the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. The request for waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) apportionment payments was timely filed; to this extent only, the appeal is granted.

By way of background, the Appellant was granted an apportionment of the Veteran's benefits as the custodial parent of their son in November 2011, effective March 11, 2011.

In January 2020, the Appellant wrote VA and asked for the apportionment to be canceled, as she and their son were now living with the Veteran.

In July 2020, VA informed the Appellant that the apportionment was terminated, effective February 1, 2020.

In February 2022, VA sent a Demand Letter in the amount of $990.00 to the Appellant.

On April 25, 2022, the Appellant emailed the Debt Management Center and wrote, "In regards to the debt, I am requesting a dispute."  On the same day, she submitted a Supplemental Claim stating she did not owe anything because when VA sent the July 2020 letter, she and the child were living with the Veteran, essentially, he was in receipt of his own apportionment.

In May 2022, the Appellant sought an audit and again disputed the debt, and again in July 2022. 

In October 2022, VA responded and informed the Appellant that they had received her debt disagreement and dispute on July 26, 2022.  VA also informed her that although she informed VA of the apportionment award adjustment in January 2020, VA did not make the adjustment until July 2020, which resulted in the $990.00 overpayment debt, and that the debt was proper in all respects.

The Appellant submitted a Financial Status Report in support of her waiver request in February 2023.

In March 2023, the Committee on Waivers and Compromises denied the Appellant's waiver request as untimely, apparently disregarding the entire procedural history outlined above, and found that she was notified on February 22, 2022 and that her waiver request was not received until February 28, 2023.  

The Appellant appealed in December 2023.

The Board finds that even a cursory reading of the Appellant's correspondences of April 2022, May 2022, and July 2022, all within the 180-day time limit to seek waiver, show she was disputing the validity of the debt and a requesting for a full waiver of any overpayment.  Accordingly, as to the issue of whether a request for waiver of recovery of an overpayment was timely received, the appeal is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) apportionment payments in the amount of $990.00 is remanded.

Due to the Board's finding of a pre-decisional duty to assist error as shown in the above grant, the issue of waiver of recovery of the overpayment must now be adjudicated by the AOJ.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Adjudicate the issue of waiver of recovery of the overpayment.  Undertake all development as necessary to adjudicate the issue, to include obtaining a complete and current financial status report from the Appellant.
