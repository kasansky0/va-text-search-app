ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a dental condition for compensation purposes is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran is not shown to have a dental disability for which compensation is payable.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for establishing service connection for a dental disorder for compensation purposes have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101(24), 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.381, 4.150.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1968 to July 1970.  During his period of service, he earned the National Defense Service Medal, two (2) Overseas Bars, Marksman Badge (M-14), Expert Badge (M-16), and Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (Korea).  

In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for a dental condition for compensation purposes most recently addressed in a September 2010 rating decision.  In January 2025, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  In a due process waiver received in March 2025, the Veteran expressly waived any remaining time to change the AMA appeal lane; thus, the Board may proceed to adjudicate the case.  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2025 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R.  §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for a dental condition for compensation purposes

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  In order to prevail on a claim of service connection, generally, there must be (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Disability compensation and VA outpatient dental treatment may be provided for certain specified types of service-connected dental disorders.  For other types of service-connected dental disorders, the claimant may receive treatment only and not compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1712; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.381, 4.150, 17.161.  Under current legal authority, compensation is only available for certain types of dental and oral conditions, as set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.150.  They include chronic osteomyelitis, osteonecrosis, or osteoradionecrosis of the maxilla or mandible; complete loss of the mandible between angles; loss of the ramus; nonunion or malunion of the mandible; temporomandibular disorder (TMD); loss of the condyloid or coronoid processes; loss of the hard palate; loss of teeth due to the loss of substance of the body of the maxilla or mandible without loss of continuity; loss of more than half of the maxilla; loss of half or less of the maxilla; malunion or nonunion of the maxilla; and benign or malignant neoplasm of the hard or soft tissue.  38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Codes 9900-9905, 9908-9909, 9911, 9913-9918.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.381, treatable carious teeth, replaceable missing teeth, dental or alveolar abscesses, and periodontal diseases are to be considered service-connected only for the purpose of establishing eligibility for outpatient dental treatment as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 17.161.

In Nielson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d 802, 808 (Fed. Cir. 2010), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) held that service trauma in a dental context means "an injury or wound produced by an external physical force during the service member's performance of military duties" and does not include "the intended result of proper medical treatment."  The Federal Circuit went on to hold, however, that although this definition of trauma excludes the intended result of proper medical treatment, it is possible that "an unintended result of medical treatment due to military negligence or malpractice" may qualify as a "service trauma."  Id.

Thus, to warrant compensation for a dental disability, as opposed to treatment only, the evidence must show not only that there was a dental trauma or disease, but that the trauma or disease caused a loss of substance of the body of the maxilla or mandible resulting in a loss of teeth.

Review of the evidence of record does not support a finding of any trauma or disease that caused loss of the substance of the body of the maxilla or mandible, resulting in any tooth loss.  38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Code 9913, Note.

Service dental records indicate moderate calculus and gingivitis upon examination in December 1968.  In June 1969 the Veteran teeth numbers 1 through 5 were extracted.  Teeth number 12 through 15 were extracted in July 1969.  Tooth number 16 was noted to be impacted and was also extracted at that time.  Tooth number 28, and teeth numbers 30 through 32 were extracted in August 1969.  Tooth number 17 was noted to be impacted and was extracted in September 1969, as well as teeth numbers 18 through 21.  Teeth numbers 22, 23, 26, and 27 were noted to be carious in October 1969.  In November 1969 teeth numbers 6 through 10 were extracted.  Teeth numbers 24 and 25 were noted to be carious in November 1969.  See STR-Medical, dated April 28, 2010, p. 5.  The Board also notes that impressions for full upper and partial lower dentures were documented.  See id., p. 4. 

Post-service treatment records do show that the Veteran wears dentures; however, the records are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for any dental disorder or related symptoms or treatment.

As discussed above, replaceable missing teeth are not compensable unless the missing teeth are the result of a loss of substance of body of the maxilla or mandible.  Absent such loss, missing teeth may only be service connected for the purpose of entitlement to dental examinations or outpatient dental treatment, which is not of issue here.  As the record does not reveal a diagnosis of loss of substance of body of the maxilla or mandible, the criteria to award entitlement to service connection for a dental condition, for compensation purposes, have not been met.  Therefore, the claim is denied.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination to determine the etiology of his dental issues.  However, as the evidence of record does not show or suggest that the Veteran has a compensable dental disability for VA purposes, such examination is not necessary to adjudicate this claim.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83-86 (2006) (describing the circumstances under which VA's duty to provide a medical examination is triggered).

Consideration has also been given to the Veteran's contentions that his dental condition should be service connected.  See VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, received June 13, 2024.  Although laypersons, such as the Veteran, are sometimes competent to provide opinions on certain medical questions, the specific issue in this case falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a layperson.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  While the Veteran can describe what he experiences, such as tooth loss, he is not able to provide competent evidence as to nature or the etiology of these symptoms.  Providing such an opinion or diagnosis requires medical expertise.  The Veteran has no such expertise.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  There is simply no competent evidence of a medical nexus.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the claim of entitlement to service connection for a dental condition for compensation purposes must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence weighs against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
