REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1984 to September 1988.

This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2023 higher-level review (HLR) decision and a December 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim requesting readjudication of the issues on appeal, all most recently addressed in a May 2022 rating decision, except for entitlement to service connection for PTSD, which was most recently adjudicated in an August 2022 rating decision.  In April 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received for any issue except for entitlement to service connection for PTSD and headaches and entitlement to an increased rating for bilateral hearing loss.  Entitlement to an earlier effective date for bilateral hearing loss was not addressed by the rating decision's "Decision" section, but it was discussed and addressed in the "Reasons for Decision" section which also denied an increased rating.

In July 2023, the Veteran requested HLR of the issues on appeal.  In July 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which denied an increased rating and an earlier effective date for hearing loss and service connection for PTSD and headaches, considering the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2023 rating decision.  For the remaining issues, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the supplemental claim decision review option for additional development.  In December 2023, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the remaining claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In his December 2023 notice of disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, for appeals regarding PTSD, headaches, and hearing loss, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the April 2023 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  With respect to the remaining service connection claims, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection requires:  (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection may be awarded on a secondary basis if a claimant suffers a disability that is "proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury."  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); but see Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023).  For "aggravation of non-service-connected disabilities" it is enough to show that a non-service-connected disability would have been less severe but-for a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability.

For certain chronic diseases, such as neuropathy or arthritis, a presumption of service connection arises if the disease is manifested to a degree of 10 percent within one year following discharge from service.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).  When a chronic disease is not shown to have manifested to a compensable degree within one year after service, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) for the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support a claim for such diseases; however, such continuity of symptomatology may only support a claim for those chronic diseases listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

When entitlement to a benefit cannot be established without a current VA examination or reexamination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination, the claim is referred for appropriate action.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a).  If the examination was scheduled in conjunction with an original service connection claim, the claim is rated based on the evidence of record.  If the examination was scheduled in conjunction with a supplemental claim or an increased rating claim, the claim is denied.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the claimant prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability

The Veteran claims service connection for a back disability.  

Service connection was initially denied in a May 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in February 2023.  The December 2023 rating decision found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claim.  This is a favorable finding by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to the address the claim on the merits.  See 38?U.S.C. § 5104A; 38?C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service treatment records do not reflect any symptoms of or treatment for a back disability.  No such abnormality was noted at the Veteran's August 1988 separation examination, and in the accompanying report of medical history she expressly denied having ever experienced recurrent back pain.

VA treatment records reflect that in January 2016 the Veteran presented to the emergency room reporting severe back pain after tripping in a hole in the road several days prior.  She was diagnosed with back pain and myalgia.  In February 2016 she presented to the emergency room reporting a flare of severe lower back pain that was present since her December 2015 fall.  X-rays showed a mild compression deformity at the anterior superior endplate of L5.  In March 2016 she reported continued pain and was diagnosed with ongoing muscular strain status post December fall.  In June 2016 she reported continued pain and was referred for physical therapy and an MRI.  In November 2017, while being treated for bilateral foot numbness, she denied low back pain.  In June 2019 she reported occasional back pain.

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's claimed back disability is related to service or manifested within one year of separation from service.  The only evidence of any back disability are VA treatment records showing back pain beginning with a December 2015 fall, decades after separation from service.  There is nothing in these records to indicate a relationship to service.  Moreover, neither the Veteran nor her representative have explained why she believes her back pain is related to service.  As the evidence shows no indication of a relationship to service, VA has no duty to provide a VA examination, and remand for such is not warranted.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); see 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).  For these reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's claimed back disability is related to service or manifested within one year of separation from service.  Service connection is therefore denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability

The Veteran claims service connection for a left hip disability.

Service connection was initially denied in a May 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in February 2023.  The December 2023 rating decision found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claim.  This is a favorable finding by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to the address the claim on the merits.  See 38?U.S.C. § 5104A; 38?C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service treatment records do not reflect any symptoms of or treatment for a left hip disability, and no such abnormality was noted at the Veteran's August 1988 separation examination.

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of a current left hip disability.  There is no evidence of such a disability in the Veteran's service treatment records, private treatment records, or VA treatment records.  Moreover, she has not presented competent and credible evidence of a left hip disability or functional impairment of earning capacity from left hip symptoms during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Indeed, she has provided no statements describing her claimed disability or explaining how she believes it is related to service.  As the evidence does not establish a current disability, VA has no duty to provide a VA examination, and remand for such is not warranted.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); see 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).  Where the evidence does not support a finding of current disability upon which to predicate a grant of service connection, there can be no valid claim for that benefit.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  As such, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of a current disability and service connection must therefore be denied.

3. Entitlement to service connection for headaches

The Veteran claims service connection for headaches.

Service connection was initially denied in a May 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in February 2023.  The December 2023 rating decision found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claim.  This is a favorable finding by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to the address the claim on the merits.  See 38?U.S.C. § 5104A; 38?C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service treatment records do not reflect any symptoms of or treatment for headaches.  No such abnormality was noted at the Veteran's August 1988 separation examination, and in the accompanying report of medical history she expressly denied having ever experienced frequent or severe headaches.

VA treatment records reflect that in January 2016 the Veteran presented to the emergency room after falling into a street hole in December 2015.  The nurse's record indicated that she reported headaches, neck pain, and back pain, but the physician's record only addressed her back pain.

The Veteran submitted medical literature with her February 2023 supplemental claim.  Specifically, a March 2016 study found an association between migraines and tinnitus among young individuals, a July 2018 study found that the risk of tinnitus was significantly higher among patients with a history of migraines, and an October 2020 study found that headaches impact tinnitus on many different levels and may be an important cofactor for tinnitus subtyping.  The Veteran is service connected for tinnitus.  None of these studies found causation or aggravation between headaches and tinnitus.  If anything, the conclusions in the July 2018 and October 2020 studies indicated that headaches may cause tinnitus, not the other way around.

Records indicate that the Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination in March 2023, but she failed to report.

In a statement accompanying her July 2023 request for HLR, the Veteran's representative argued for a VA examination for her headaches, which may be related to her service-connected tinnitus.

A November 2023 record indicates additional attempts to schedule the Veteran for a VA examination, but she was unable to be contacted.

The Board finds that the Veteran has not shown good cause for her failure to report to her March 2023 VA examination.  After submitting her February 2023 supplemental claim, an examination was scheduled for March 2023.  This examination was necessary to obtain an opinion as to whether her headaches were related to her tinnitus.  She did not report.  The Board recognizes that while the record does not clearly reflect whether the Veteran was given proper notice of this examination.  Nevertheless, both she and her attorney were adequately notified by the April 2023 rating decision that she had been scheduled for an examination and had failed to report.  No good cause for this failure was shown; rather, in her July 2023 request for HLR, the attorney merely requested that another examination be scheduled.  Attempts to contact her to schedule another examination failed.  Neither the Veteran nor her representative have given any explanation for her failure to report to her initial examination.  Furthermore, the Board finds that the examination was necessary because the AOJ could not have requested a medical opinion based on review of the record.  There was simply no medical evidence in the record for an examiner to review, with no diagnosis of any particular type of headaches.  The only evidence of a current disability was the Veteran's act of filing a claim.  While she is competent to report her symptoms of headaches, she is not competent to diagnose her headaches absent medical examination.  For these reasons, Board finds that the Veteran has not shown good cause for her failure to report to her March 2023 VA examination.  As this appeal arises from her February 2023 supplemental claim, service connection must be denied under 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b). 

4. Entitlement to service connection for a left ankle disability

5. Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability

The Veteran claims service connection for disabilities of the bilateral ankles.

Service connection was initially denied in a May 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in February 2023.  The December 2023 rating decision found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claims.  This is a favorable finding by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to the address the claims on the merits.  See 38?U.S.C. § 5104A; 38?C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service treatment records do not reflect any symptoms of or treatment for an ankle disability, and no such abnormality was noted at the Veteran's August 1988 separation examination.

VA treatment records reflect that in May 2016 the Veteran presented with a fracture of the first metatarsal head of the right foot.  Right ankle x-rays were normal.

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of a current left ankle disability.  There is no evidence of such a disability in the Veteran's service treatment records, private treatment records, or VA treatment records.  Moreover, she has not presented competent and credible evidence of a left ankle disability or functional impairment of earning capacity from left ankle symptoms during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Indeed, she has provided no statements describing her claimed disability or explaining how she believes it is related to service.  As the evidence does not establish a current disability, VA has no duty to provide a VA examination, and remand for such is not warranted.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); see 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).  Where the evidence does not support a finding of current disability upon which to predicate a grant of service connection, there can be no valid claim for that benefit.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  As such, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of a current disability and service connection must therefore be denied.

The Board further finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's claimed right ankle disability is related to service or manifested within one year of separation from service.  The only evidence of any right ankle disability are VA treatment records showing a metatarsal fracture in May 2016, decades after separation from service.  There is nothing in these records to indicate a relationship to service.  Moreover, neither the Veteran nor her representative have explained why she believes an ankle disability is related to service.  As the evidence shows no indication of a relationship to service, VA has no duty to provide a VA examination, and remand for such is not warranted.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); see 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).  For these reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's claimed right ankle disability is related to service or manifested within one year of separation from service.  Service connection is therefore denied.

6. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability

7. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability

The Veteran claims service connection for disabilities of the bilateral knees.

Service connection was initially denied in a May 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in February 2023.  The December 2023 rating decision found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claims.  This is a favorable finding by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to the address the claims on the merits.  See 38?U.S.C. § 5104A; 38?C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service treatment records do not reflect any symptoms of or treatment for a knee disability.  No such abnormality was noted at the Veteran's August 1988 separation examination, and in the accompanying report of medical history she expressly denied having ever experienced a trick or locked knee.

VA treatment records reflect that in November 2023 the Veteran presented to the emergency room with an abrasion on her left knee after a fall.  X-rays showed no acute fracture or dislocation and mild narrowing of the medial femoral tibial compartment.  She was diagnosed with a left knee abrasion and early cellulitis with mild edema in the left leg.

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's claimed left knee disability is related to service or manifested within one year of separation from service.  The only evidence of any left knee disability are VA treatment records showing an abrasion after a fall in November 2023, decades after separation from service.  There is nothing in these records to indicate a relationship to service.  Moreover, neither the Veteran nor her representative have explained why she believes a knee disability is related to service.  As the evidence shows no indication of a relationship to service, VA has no duty to provide a VA examination, and remand for such is not warranted.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); see 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).  For these reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's claimed left knee disability is related to service or manifested within one year of separation from service.  Service connection is therefore denied.

The Board further finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of a current right knee disability.  There is no evidence of such a disability in the Veteran's service treatment records, private treatment records, or VA treatment records.  Moreover, she has not presented competent and credible evidence of a right knee disability or functional impairment of earning capacity from left ankle symptoms during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Indeed, she has provided no statements describing her claimed disability or explaining how she believes it is related to service.  As the evidence does not establish a current disability, VA has no duty to provide a VA examination, and remand for such is not warranted.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); see 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).  Where the evidence does not support a finding of current disability upon which to predicate a grant of service connection, there can be no valid claim for that benefit.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  As such, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of a current disability and service connection must therefore be denied.

8. Entitlement to service connection for left foot neuropathy

9. Entitlement to service connection for right foot neuropathy

The Veteran claims service connection for neuropathy of the bilateral feet.

Service connection was initially denied in a May 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in February 2023.  The December 2023 rating decision found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claim.  This is a favorable finding by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to the address the claim on the merits.  See 38?U.S.C. § 5104A; 38?C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service treatment records do not reflect any symptoms of or treatment for a foot disability.  No such abnormality was noted at the Veteran's August 1988 separation examination, and in the accompanying report of medical history she expressly denied having ever experienced foot trouble or neuritis.

Private treatment records reflect that in September 2006 the Veteran reported numbness in both feet.

VA treatment records reflect that in March 2016 the Veteran reported numbness into her feet related to her recent back pain, but on later questioning reported that the numbness had actually been going on for many years.  She exhibited gross loss of sensation to the plantar surface of the feet and up to mid-shin to pinprick and light touch.  She was diagnosed with neuropathy consistent with vitamin deficiency or diabetes.  In May 2016 she reported a progressive three week history of right foot pain, swelling, and numbness.  She was diagnosed with a fracture of the first metatarsal head in the right foot confirmed by x-ray.  In November 2017 she reported bilateral foot numbness that first started three to four months prior and had worsened over the prior two to three weeks.  She was diagnosed with numbness likely secondary to neuropathy which may be due to vitamin deficiency or alcohol use.  In June 2018 she reported that her neuropathy had resolved since she cut down on her drinking.  In June 2019 she reported an exacerbation of peripheral neuropathy.  She stated that she started having numbness again three weeks prior after her prescriptions ran out.  She was diagnosed with bilateral lower extremity numbness due to alcohol versus vitamin deficiency.  In September 2019, as she was treated for elongated painful toenails, she reported numbness and tingling in the toes.  Her podiatrist diagnosed alcohol-induced painful peripheral neuropathy with digital ischemia.  At an October 2021 podiatry consultation, she again reported and was diagnosed with severe alcohol-induced painful peripheral neuropathy.  In February 2022 she reported continued bilateral foot neuropathy with a recent fall.  She was diagnosed with painful alcohol-induced peripheral neuropathy.

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's bilateral foot neuropathy is related to service or manifested within one year of separation from service.  The Veteran's treatment records indicate numbness first reported in 2006, decades after separation from service.  There is nothing in these records to indicate a relationship to service.  Rather, her podiatrists and physicians consistently attribute her neuropathy to vitamin deficiencies or her alcohol use.  Moreover, neither the Veteran nor her representative have explained why she believes her neuropathy is related to service.  As the evidence shows no indication of a relationship to service, VA has no duty to provide a VA examination, and remand for such is not warranted.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); see 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).  For these reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's bilateral foot neuropathy is related to service or manifested within one year of separation from service.  Service connection is therefore denied.

10. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD

The Veteran appealed a denial of service connection for PTSD.  The Board has recharacterized the issue in accordance with Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition was initially denied in an August 2014 legacy decision based on a finding of no in-service event, disease, or injury.  The Veteran did not appeal this denial, and no new and material evidence was received within the one-year appeal period.  The decision therefore became final.  

In November 2020, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim requesting readjudication of service connection for a mental health condition, now claimed as due to military sexual trauma.  Her claim was denied in a May 2021 rating decision.  In May 2022, she again submitted a supplemental claim requesting readjudication of the claim.  The claim was again denied in an August 2022 rating decision, after which the Veteran submitted the February 2023 supplemental claim giving rise to this appeal.  The April 2023 rating decision and July 2023 HLR decision found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate this claim, now characterized as service connection for PTSD.  This is a favorable finding by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to the address the claim on the merits.  See 38?U.S.C. § 5104A; 38?C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service connection for PTSD requires:  (1) a diagnosis of the disorder made in accordance with the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred; and (3) a link established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304(f), 4.125(a).

There are special considerations for PTSD claims predicated on a personal assault.  The pertinent regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5), provides that PTSD based on a personal assault in service permits evidence from sources other than a veteran's service records which may corroborate his or her account of the stressor incident.  Examples of such evidence include but are not limited to records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5).  VBA's Adjudication Procedure Manual, M21-1MR, also identifies alternative sources for developing evidence of personal assault, including private medical records, civilian police reports, reports from crisis intervention centers, testimonial statements from confidants such as family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy, and personal diaries or journals.  M21-1MR, Part IV, Subpart ii, 1.D.17.n.

Evidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources.  Examples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include but are not limited to a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance, substance abuse, episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5).

Service treatment records do not reflect any symptoms of or treatment for mental health disabilities apart from treatment for substance abuse, referenced in records dated March 1986 and August 1988 which characterized her as a "drug experimenter."  No mental health abnormality was noted at the Veteran's August 1988 separation examination, and in the accompanying report of medical history she expressly denied having ever experienced depression, excessive worry, or nervous trouble of any sort.

Private treatment records reflect that in July 2010 the Veteran reported to the emergency room with suicidal intent.  She was admitted and diagnosed with alcohol abuse, rule out alcohol dependence, cocaine abuse, and rule out substance induced mood disorder, depressed type.  In January 2012 she presented to the emergency room reporting alcoholism and seeking detoxification.  She reported alcoholism for 10-15 years.  At a psychiatric evaluation the next day she described alcohol dependence of 20 years or longer.  She stated that she was told she had bipolar disorder.  She was not currently taking medication and denied a history of psychiatric admissions or recent treatment.  She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, alcohol dependence, and cannabis dependence.  After four days she was discharged with diagnoses of alcohol withdrawal with psychotic symptoms and suicidal ideation.  She continued outpatient treatment for depression and bipolar disorder in January 2012 and February 2012.

In December 2013, the Veteran communicated an intent to claim service connection for anxiety and alcoholism.  In February 2014 she submitted a formal fully developed claim for depression and bipolar disorder.

VA treatment records reflect that in December 2013 the Veteran reported a depressed mood for about three years.  She described intermittent depressed and anxious moods that had been worse in the past.  She endorsed periodic feelings of helplessness.  She reported drinking a half pint of vodka and some beer daily.  She was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, rule out substance induced mood disorder, and rule out adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious mood.  In February 2014 she reported that she was very anxious due to financial constraints and currently being unemployed.  In March 2014 she presented for alcohol detoxification treatment for three weeks.

In a June 2014 statement, the Veteran reported depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.  She attributed her depression to her inability to pay her bills.  She stated that she learned how to drink alcohol in the military and attributed her mental health disability to military sexual trauma.

VA treatment records reflect that in December 2015 the Veteran endorsed symptoms associated with alcohol dependence, PTSD, anxiety, depression, mania, and psychosis.  She was diagnosed with alcohol-induced bipolar and related disorder/depressive disorder with alcohol-induced mood disorder.  

In February 2016 she presented to the emergency room reporting low back pain and depression caused by financial problems, employment problems, marital problems, health problems, and loneliness.  She initially reported suicidal ideation.  She reported a history of abuse including military sexual trauma.  She was diagnosed with unspecified depressive disorder, PTSD, and substance use disorders.  

In April 2017 she presented to the emergency room reporting that she was depressed and could not take it anymore.  She described excessive drinking due to her mood and family issues.  She was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder and depression.  After one to two hours, she changed her mind and asked to leave.  In November 2017, she reported depression and anxiety surrounding her unemployment and stated that she tried to drink her problems away.  At a consultation for substance abuse disorder treatment, she reported that she started drinking when she was in service.  She reported improved mood since she stopped drinking.  She was diagnosed with moderate alcohol use disorder, rule out bipolar disorder versus substance induced mood disorder versus major depressive disorder.  She continued treatment in December 2017.  

In June 2018 she reported she had cut down on her drinking and her depression was much better.  

In June 2019 she reported worsening depressive symptoms.  In July 2019 she presented to the emergency room reporting exacerbation of chronic pain in the context of psychosocial stressors including financing, inability to work, and family conflict.  In August 2019 she presented to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of delirium more likely than a primary mood or psychotic disorder and was admitted for treatment.  On further observation she appeared to be acutely psychotic versus delirious without any clear medical cause.  She reported anxiety about her financial situation and was mildly paranoid about those around her.  She was discharged from mental health and admitted for addiction treatment.  During treatment, she reported that she was raped at least three different times while in service.  She stated that she never told anyone because she felt shameful and was worried what people would say.  She was diagnosed with PTSD, major depressive disorder, rule out bipolar disorder, and substance abuse disorder.

In her November 2020 supplemental claim, the Veteran claimed service connection for a mental health disability as due to military sexual trauma.

The Veteran underwent a VA PTSD examination in April 2021.  She reported that her tech sergeant would slap her behind every morning and occasionally grope her.  She stated that on one occasion he grabbed her, took her in the back room and tried to assault her.  Another man in her office pressured her into sex; she stated she had no other choice.  On a third occasion she accompanied a man to his house, and he came out naked.  She thought she was going to be raped and disrobed, but the man took her back to the base when she asked.  The examiner found no current symptoms and stated that the Veteran did not have a current mental health disability under the DSM-5 criteria.  

VA treatment records reflect that in August 2021 the Veteran returned to primary care for the first time since September 2019, having avoided medical care during the pandemic.  She was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.  She was not on any current medication for a mental health disability.  At a March 2022 consultation, she denied current psychiatric distress but reported a lifetime history of depressive episodes and recurrent anxiety.  She attributed the depression to difficulty navigating interpersonal dynamics, difficulty managing unpleasant emotions, and coping with increased current psychosocial stressors.  She attributed the anxiety to increased worry, having known several people who died of the pandemic.  She denied any history of PTSD related to military sexual trauma or otherwise.

The Veteran underwent a VA mental disorders examination in May 2022.  She reported doing well.  She stated that she was seeking help from VA and that she knew it was not related to the service or anything, but she needed the money.  The examiner found that she did not meet diagnostic criteria for any mental disorder at this time.  

The Veteran submitted two statements with her February 2023 supplemental claim.  In the first statement, she stated that she believed her PTSD was related to her service.  She stated that on several occasions in service she dealt with sexual assaults from her superior officers and bosses.  She stated that almost every day she was expected to attend after-work cookouts with plenty of alcohol.  She stated that these incidents impacted her immediately, causing anxiety, depression, and frustration.  She believed her mental health condition led to the development of her alcohol addiction.  She stated that she consistently experienced nightmares, flashbacks, difficulty dealing with stress, and difficulty interacting with others, especially men.  In the second statement, her husband stated that they have been separated for several years due to her anxiety and mood swings, though they still talked daily.  He stated that they met in service.  He described her has emotionally volatile and stated that she began drinking at this time.

The Veteran underwent another VA PTSD examination in March 2023.  She was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.  The examiner explained that she did not meet the criteria for any other mental health diagnosis under the DSM-5.  The examiner opined that her alcohol use disorder was less likely than not related to her military sexual trauma.  This opinion was based on the rationale that she reported that her problematic alcohol use started in the early 2000s in the context of marital, family, and financial stressors at that time.  The examiner nevertheless stated that her reports of military sexual trauma were supported by multiple indirect markers in her records, including testing for sexually transmitted disease, drug use related to stress, urinary tract infection, and chest pain.  The examiner thus found that the record as likely as not supported the occurrence of military sexual trauma.

In a statement accompanying her July 2023 request for HLR, the Veteran's representative argued that the March 2023 VA examination was inadequate.  The representative argued that the examiner failed to acknowledge multiple past diagnoses of PTSD in August 2019 and September 2019, and failed to discuss the lay statement submitted by the Veteran and her spouse.  The representative also argued that the examiner failed to acknowledge markers in the record suggesting that military sexual trauma occurred, despite the examiner's explicit finding that the record supported the occurrence of such trauma due to said markers.  The representative also erroneously argued that the examiner failed to provide an alternative cause for the disability, despite the examiner's express attribution of her diagnosis to post-separation marital, family, and financial stressors.

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's mental health disability is related to service.  The April 2021, May 2022 and March 2023 VA examiners found that her current symptoms did not meet the criteria for any diagnosis under the DSM-5 beyond alcohol use disorder.  The March 2023 examiner further offered an opinion that, despite the likelihood that she experienced military sexual trauma, her disorder was less likely than not related to service based on the record of her increased drinking due to current stressors, not in-service incidents.  This opinion is fully consistent with treatment records focused heavily on contemporaneous stressors.  While the Veteran's representative argued that the examiner did not acknowledge her prior diagnoses of PTSD in 2019, such diagnoses are of minimal probative value to her current disability upon filing her continuously pursued November 2020 claim.  Her representative further argued that the examiner failed to address the February 2023 lay evidence.  Notably, the examination did reference these statements, though not expressly when offering a rationale.  The Board gives the Veteran's February 2023 statement minimal probative value as it is inconsistent and conflicts with statements made to VA examiners and treatment providers.  The Veteran's post-service treatment records contain no discussion of her military sexual trauma, and to the extent they focus on trauma, they refer to traumas experienced prior to her induction into service.  The symptoms she reported in the February 2023 statement further conflict with her reports at her May 2022 VA examination, where she stated that she was doing well and expressly acknowledged that her prior symptoms were unrelated to service, and in her August 2021 VA treatment records, where she denied current symptoms and attributed her past symptoms solely to post-service stressors.  

In addition, to the extent the Veteran asserts that she started abusing alcohol and drugs during service, the law is clear that progressive and frequent use of drugs to the point of addiction will be considered willful misconduct.  38 C.F.R. § 3.301 (c)(3).

The Board has taken the Veteran's concerns seriously. She and her husband are competent to report mental health symptoms that are observable.  However, determining the etiology of an acquired psychiatric disorder falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person because it involves a medical subject extending beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1376 (2007); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011). Thus, the Board gives the VA examiner opinions more probative value because the examiners have greater medical training.  See Black v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 297, 284 (1997) (in evaluating the probative value of medical statements, the Board looks at factors such as the individual knowledge and skill in analyzing the medical data).

For these reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's mental health disability is related to service, and service connection is therefore denied.

11. Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss

The Veteran claims an increased rating for her bilateral hearing loss.

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss was granted in a May 2022 rating decision which assigned a noncompensable rating.  The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in February 2023.  The July 2023 HLR decision found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claim.  This is a favorable finding by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to the address the claim on the merits.  See 38?U.S.C. § 5104A; 38?C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Disability evaluations are determined by application of the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  An evaluation of the level of disability present must also include consideration of the functional impairment of the Veteran's ability to engage in ordinary activities, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  

When a question arises as to which of two ratings apply under a particular diagnostic code, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).

In evaluating service-connected hearing loss, disability ratings are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are performed.  Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992).  An examination for hearing impairment for VA purposes must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a pure tone audiometry test.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85.  Evaluations of bilateral hearing loss range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on an organic impairment of hearing acuity, as measured by controlled speech discrimination tests in conjunction with the average hearing threshold, as measured by pure tone audiometric tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 cycles per second.  The rating schedule establishes 11 auditory acuity Levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness.

VA audiological evaluations are conducted using a controlled speech discrimination test together with the results of pure tone audiometry tests.  The vertical line in Table VI (printed in 38 C.F.R. § 4.85) represents nine categories of the percentage of discrimination based on a controlled speech discrimination test.  The horizontal columns in Table VI represent 9 categories of decibel loss based on the pure tone audiometry test.  The numeric designation of impaired hearing (Levels I through XI) is determined for each ear by intersecting the vertical row appropriate for the percentage of discrimination and the horizontal column appropriate to the pure tone decibel loss.  The percentage evaluation is found from Table VII in 38 C.F.R. § 4.85 by intersecting the vertical column appropriate for the numeric designation for the ear having the better hearing acuity and the horizontal row appropriate for the numeric designation for the level for the ear having the poorer hearing acuity.  For example, if the better ear had a numeric designation of Level V and the poorer ear had a numeric designation of Level VII the percentage evaluation is 30 percent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

Regulations also provide that in cases of exceptional hearing loss, i.e., when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 hertz) is 55 decibels or more, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Each ear will be evaluated separately.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b) further provide that when the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or VIa, whichever results in the higher Roman numeral.  That numeral will then be elevated to the next higher Roman numeral. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in May 2022.  She reported that her daughter complained that she had the television too loud and had to repeat things for her.  Pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Average

RIGHT	10	15	15	20	15

LEFT	15	15	15	20	16.25

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 88 percent in each ear.  The examiner diagnosed hearing loss based on speech discrimination.

The Board finds that an initial compensable evaluation is not warranted for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss.  Her May 2022 VA examination showed speech recognition ability and pure tone thresholds indicating Level II hearing loss on Table VI.  Under Table VII, these levels warrant a noncompensable rating; compensable ratings are not available without at least Level IV hearing loss in the worse ear.  Furthermore, her 1000-2000 hertz thresholds were less than 55 decibels, and her 2000 hertz thresholds were less than 70 decibels.  Exceptional hearing loss under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 is therefore inapplicable.  There is no evidence to contradict the findings at the May 2022 VA examination, and neither the Veteran nor her representative have offered argument or explanation as to why she believes a higher rating is warranted.  For these reasons, the Board finds that an initial compensable evaluation is not warranted for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss.

12. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 10, 2020 for an award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss

The Veteran claims an earlier effective date for her award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss was granted in a May 2022 rating decision which assigned an effective date of September 10, 2020.  The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in February 2023.  While neither the April 2023 rating decision nor the July 2023 HLR decision made an express finding regarding new and relevant evidence, both decisions addressed the issue on the merits.  As such, viewed in the light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds an implicit finding of new and relevant evidence having been received.  This is a favorable finding by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to the address the claim on the merits.  See 38?U.S.C. § 5104A; 38?C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Generally, the effective date of an award of a service connection claim, including a claim reopened after a final disallowance, is the date of receipt of a claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

Under regulations applicable prior to March 24, 2015, any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim.  An informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2014).

If a claimant submits an?intent to file?a claim, VA will recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within a year.? An?intent to file?a claim can be submitted in one of the following three ways: (1) saved electronic application; (2) written intent on prescribed intent to file a claim form; or (3) an oral intent communication to designated VA personnel and recorded in writing.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.155(b).? 

The first communication from the Veteran expressing an intent to claim service connection for hearing loss was an October 2020 fully developed claim attaching to an intent to file received by VA on September 10, 2020, the Veteran's current effective date.

(Continued on the next page)

?

The Board finds that an effective date earlier than September 10, 2020 is not warranted for the Veteran's award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  There is no evidence of any communication expressing an intent to claim service connection for bilateral hearing loss prior to this date.  Moreover, neither the Veteran nor her representative have presented evidence or argument explaining why she believes an earlier effective date is warranted.  For these reasons, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than September 10, 2020 is not warranted for the Veteran's award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
