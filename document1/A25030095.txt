FINDING OF FACT

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim for entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service from July 1972 to September 1996. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) following a November 2020 rating decision denying service connection for a low back disorder.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in December 2021. He elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2020 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Following review of the record, however, the Board concludes that the appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder is not properly before the Board. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.203, a claimant must file a properly completed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) to an AOJ decision within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision. An extension of the period for filing a Notice of Disagreement may be granted for good cause. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board, and the Board will determine whether good cause for an extension has been shown. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b). 

Here, the AOJ issued the decision denying service connection for a low back disorder was issued on November 13, 2020. Notice of this decision was mailed to the Veteran on November 17, 2020. On June 17, 2021, the Veteran attempted to file a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, again seeking service connection for a low back disorder. On June 18, 2021, the Veteran was informed that his VA Form 21-526EZ could not be accepted because the claim for entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder had previously been denied. He was instructed to file a different form if he wished to have his claim for service connection for a low back disorder reviewed. The letter also included a chart to help the Veteran identify what form he needed to submit. 

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), received on December 23, 2021. He indicated that he was seeking review of a June 18, 2021 rating decision denying service connection for a low back disorder. However, the Board notes that no rating decision was issued on June 18, 2021. Rather, the only rating decision addressing the claim for service connection for a low back disorder was issued on November 13, 2020. 

The evidence clearly shows that VA did not receive the December 23, 2021 VA Form 10182 within one year of the November 17, 2020 notification of the rating decision on appeal. This VA Form 10182 is therefore considered untimely. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(a). 

The Veteran does not contest this. Rather, after the Veteran was notified that his VA Form 10182 was not timely, he submitted a letter in February 2025 in which he provided the same timeline of events as described above. He stated, "I make no excuses for the 38-day lateness." He went on to explain that his VA Form 10182 was not timely because he originally used the wrong form in June 2021. He also pointed out that VA confirmed receipt of the December 2021 VA Form 10182 and sent him several emails and letters regarding the status of this appeal over the past several years. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's February 2025 letter does not show good cause for the untimely submission of the December 2021 VA Form 10182. Although the Veteran states that he was not notified that he submitted the wrong form until almost a year after he incorrectly submitted the VA Form 21-526EZ in June 2021. However, this conflicts with the record, which shows that he was notified that he had submitted the incorrect form on June 18, 2021, one day after VA received his VA Form 21-526EZ. The Veteran had nearly five months remaining to submit the correct form before the expiration of the one-year period from the November 17, 2020 notification of the rating decision. He has not explained why he was unable to submit the correct form in those five months. Thus, the Board finds that good cause has not been shown, and the December 2021 VA Form 10182 was not timely with respect to the issue of entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203. 

As essential claims processing rules have not been filed, the issue of entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder must be dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.
