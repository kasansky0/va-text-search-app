DOCKET NO. 210604-281068
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA COVID-19 testing provided to the Veteran on February 10, 2021, by Aegis Science Corporation (ASC) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The COVID-19 testing performed by ASC on February 10, 2021, was not authorized by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) nor performed as part of emergency medical care to the Veteran.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There is no legal basis for payment of expenses for medical services performed by ASC on February 10, 2021.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1725, 1728; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.120, 17.1002, 17.4000-17.4040.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Appellant is a provider that furnished services to the Veteran.  See generally 38 U.S.C. § 1703(c), (h); 38 C.F.R. § 17.4030.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a decision of the VA Veterans Health Administration, which constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  Here, VHA denied payment for a February 10, 2021, episode of care furnished by the Appellant because pre-authorization had not been received.

The AOJ denied payment for a COVID-19 test, a non-emergency medical service, furnished by ASC on February 10, 2021, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1703, on the basis that such services had not been authorized by VA as required for payment.  The appellant appealed.

In general, non-VA care and medical services that will be paid for by VA through the Veterans Community Care Program must be authorized in advance.  See 38 C.F.R. § 17.4020.  However, the Board takes notice that the Office of Community Care announced a policy by VA to temporarily reimburse all COVID-19 testing claims for eligible veterans. On Community Care's "Provider News" webpage, it specifically states that "COVID-19 testing and services with dates of service prior to January 1, 2021, that were not authorized (do not have a VA referral) can be submitted to VA for payment," but that claims for dates of service after January 1, 2021, must be approved via VA referral or otherwise meet urgent or emergent care eligibility requirements to warrant payment.  See Provider News, Community Care, Health Care, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/providers/Latest_news.asp (last updated December 29, 2021).

In addition, the Board finds that the record is negative for evidence that the Veteran received the medical services as part of an emergent event.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1725, 1728.

As the COVID-19 diagnostic testing in question was provided on February 10, 2021, the announced Community Care Program policy is inapplicable.  Therefore, relevant VHA policy was that prior approval of the COVID-19 related services was needed for testing on February 10, 2021.  Accordingly, the appellant's claim for payment of the expenses of such services must be denied.  See Sabonis 

v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
