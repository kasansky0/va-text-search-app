ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type 2 is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran did not serve in a location with a presumption of herbicide agent exposure. 

2. The Veteran was not otherwise exposed to herbicide agents during military service.

3. The Veteran's hypertension did not begin in service.

4. The Veteran's hypertension is not causally related to his military service.

5. The Veteran's diabetes mellitus type 2 did not begin in service.

6. The Veteran's diabetes mellitus is not causally related to his military service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type 2 are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from May 1973 to March 1974.

These issues come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 3, 2024, Rating Decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the May 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran also listed the issue of "deferred decision for entitlement obstructive sleep apnea" and the April 5, 2024, rating decision (giving the notice letter date rather than the April 3, 2024, date on the decision itself) on his Notice of Disagreement. While the April 3, 2024, rating decision did defer that issue, an April 22, 2024, rating decision granted service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. As the Veteran does not identify any determination in the April 22, 2024, rating decision with which he disagrees, the Board concludes that no issue from that rating decision is currently on appeal.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type 2.

2. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension.

Service Connection on a Presumptive Basis

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for diabetes mellitus type 2 (diabetes) and hypertension, specifically due to his alleged exposure to herbicide agents while serving in the Navy. See May 2024 Correspondence. 

If a Veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent (to include Agent Orange) during active service, certain diseases shall be service connected if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6) are met, even if there is no record of such disease during service, provided further that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d) are also satisfied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). Serving in certain locations applies a presumption that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6).

The Veteran contends he was exposed while serving on the U.S.S. Gurke. See May 2024 Correspondence. However, the AOJ's development of the claim, which included obtaining the logbooks of the ship, resulted in a finding that the ship nor the Veteran were in any of the locations where a presumption of exposure to herbicides would apply. See February 2024 VA Memo; February 2024 Records Research Center Response; February 2024 Logbooks. A review of the ships logbooks in detail resulted in a finding that while the Veteran was aboard the ship, it was operating in the Western Pacific, however not within 12 nautical miles of the Republic of Vietnam nor any of the other PACT Act locations. Id. Thus, the AOJ concluded the Veteran did not serve in any of the locations listed in 38 U.S.C. § 1116 and 38 C.F.R. §3.307(a)(6) which would presume exposure to herbicide agents. 

The Veteran submitted a statement in June 2023 in which he states that while he was assigned to the U.S.S. Gurke it traveled in and out of the shores of Vietnam in the Sea of Tonkin. See June 2023 statement in Support of Claim. 

The Board finds that the evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran served in one of the locations listed in 38 U.S.C. § 1116 or 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6). The AOJ's development and research of the claim found that the Gurke did not serve in any of the presumptive locations while the Veteran was aboard it. It determined, based on review of the logbooks it obtained, that the ship served in the northern waters of the Western Pacific and in and around the Philippines. The Veteran's counter assertion that the ship traveled in and out of the waterways of Vietnam is unsupported in the record. The Board finds that the logbook review greatly outweighs the Veteran's recollection and discounts his credibility. As such, the evidence demonstrates persuasively that the Veteran did not serve in any of the location where a presumption of exposure to herbicides exists. 

However, notwithstanding the forgoing, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has held that a Veteran is not precluded from establishing service connection where entitlement on a presumptive basis is not warranted, as long as there is proof of direct causation. Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-1044 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

Other Bases of Service Connection

The evidence does not reflect, and the Veteran has not contended, that his diabetes or hypertension began during service. Service treatment records do not reflect any treatment for diabetes or hypertension. The March 2024 VA examination notes that the date of the Veteran's diabetes diagnosis was 2005. See March 2024 VA Examination. The same examination found that the Veteran's hypertension date of diagnosis was March 2024. Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran's diabetes nor his hypertension began during service.

Direct Service Connection Basis-Exposure to Herbicides

With respect to service connection on a direct basis, the evidence demonstrates the Veteran has a diagnosis of diabetes and hypertension. Thus, the first element of service connection is met for both claims. Therefore, the Board turns to the second element of service connection, to determine whether the Veteran showed an in-service exposure to herbicide agents. 

Although the Veteran argues the Board has the records showing he handled both powder and liquid form of agent orange while service on the Gurke, no such evidence exists in the file. A review of the evidence before the AOJ at the time of the Rating Decision is absent any evidence whatsoever that the Veteran ever came in contact with agent orange. See November 2019 Military Personnel Record; October 2014 Military Personnel Record. 

Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence of record demonstrates persuasively that the Veteran's diabetes or hypertension was not incurred in-service or related to exposure to herbicide agents. The Board finds the Veteran's recollection, particularly in light of his mistaken memory that the Gurke transited the territorial waters of the Republic of Vietnam and offered nearly 50 years after the events in question, to be of no credibility. In the absence of competent, credible evidence, the second element of service connection is not met on this basis for either claim. 

Direct Service Connection Basis-Exposure to a TERA

Although the Veteran is found not to have been exposed to herbicide agents, the Veteran did participate in a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) and the AOJ found exposure to asbestos. See February 2024 TERA Memorandum; April 2024 Rating Decision. This satisfies the second element of service connection for this theory of entitlement for both claims. Thus, the Board turns to whether there is competent medical evidence of a nexus between the Veteran's service and his in-service exposure to asbestos. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination and TERA medical opinion in March 2024 for both his claims. The examiner found that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's diabetes or his hypertension is caused by asbestos. The rationale was that there was nothing in the medical literature that says that diabetes or hypertension is due to exposure to asbestos. For both claims, the examiner provided details from the Veteran's file, an alternative etiology of the claimed condition, and the sources he used for his research. See March 2024 C&P Exam. 

The Board finds the VA medical opinions adequate and assigns them great probative value. They are based on the Veteran's prior medical history, cite the medical resources used by the examiner in researching the opinions, and describe the medical principles used to make the determinations. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). As such, the third element of service connection is not met for either claim as there is not competent medical evidence showing a nexus between the in-service exposure to asbestos and the current diagnosis of diabetes or hypertension.

Accordingly, the Veteran is not entitled to service connection on a direct basis for either claim. Since the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents in-service, or that the Veteran's exposure to asbestos is causally related to his diabetes or hypertension, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply and the claims are denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
