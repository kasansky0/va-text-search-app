REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for lumbar spine strain and intervertebral disc syndrome (claimed as low back condition) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from October 1998 to May 2007.

In a May 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran timely appealed the May 2024 rating decision and elected the Direct Review docket.

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for intervertebral disc syndrome, most recently addressed in a February 2022 rating decision. In January 2024, the AOJ issued a supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and adjudicated the claim on the merits. 

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) and requested review of the January 2024 supplemental claim decision. In May 2024 the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2024 supplemental claim rating decision.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 supplemental rating decision that was subject to the HLR request. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the January 2024 supplemental claim decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that while the May 2024 HLR decision contains a heading stating no new and relevant evidence was received, as the January 2024 decision addressed the merits of the claim and did not indicate the January 2024 AOJ favorable finding of new and relevant evidence was rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error, the Board will proceed to adjudicate the claim on the merits. 38 C.F.R. 3.104(c).

The Board also recognizes the Court's decision in Williams v. McDonough, requiring the Board to afford the Veteran the opportunity to modify his docket election in the absence of a waiver of this right. 37 Vet. App. 305, 310 (2024). However, because the Board is remanding the claim, the Veteran is not prejudiced by the Board's expedient disposition prior to expiration of the time to request a docket switch.

Entitlement to service connection for lumbar spine strain and intervertebral disc syndrome (claimed as low back condition) is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his low back condition is caused by, related to, or aggravated by his service-connected left hip condition. 

Service treatment records reflect treatment for lower back pain and stiffness after an in-service motor vehicle accident in 1999. See STR 8/24/07 p. 17 (4/12/1999); September 2007 VA examination (diagnosis chronic spine strain, onset 1999 car accident); November 2007 rating decision (finding "one-time complaint" of lower back pain in service lacks nexus for service connection). The Veteran's 2007 discharge examination does not note any back issues, nor does his 2003 retention examination. See 08/24/2007 STR, p. 2 (04/09/2007), p. 7 (07/17/2003). Treatment records do not reflect any further complaints of back pain or issues since 1999, until the Veteran reported undergoing back surgery in October 2012. See 03/17/2020 CAPRI, p. 73 (11/27/2012 PCP treatment record). The Veteran's file contains no treatment records reflecting the Veteran's 2012 back surgery or complaints of back problems leading up to it. 

A November 2023 VA examination provided a diagnosis of intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and spinal stenosis. The Veteran reported chronic pain and problems with walking, inability to run or play golf, decreased range of motion of his back, and numbness and tingling of his lower extremities. He reported onset after an injury to his right fibula incurred in a fall during service in 2000 in the Middle East, after which he noticed problems with walking and pain and has since suffered ongoing back problems. The Veteran stated he received treatment for his back pain in service with pain medication. He reported undergoing back surgery (disc herniation and lumbar laminectomy/ discectomy/decompression) in 2012 and that he was advised by his private spine physician to have a second surgery but declined. Severe flareups occurring every couple of weeks and lasting two weeks were endorsed. Functional impact was noted of pain and inability to perform activities such as prolonged walking, running, golfing, or riding a bike, causing him emotional issues as well.

In a January 2024 opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed low back condition was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) proximately due to or the result of his service connected left hip Iliopsoas tendinitis. The rationale was that IVDS is a separate entity entirely from left hip Iliopsoas tendinitis and unrelated. The examiner concluded that a thorough review of medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship. The examiner further reasoned that IVDS results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, some of which have been identified, but many that remain unknown. In addition to reviewing the potential genetic factors, the environmental factors listed included aging, smoking, obesity, chronic inflammation, and driving for long periods of time. The examiner also observed that the Veteran reports onset of his back condition in 1999, which is prior to onset of his left hip condition as reported by the Veteran after an ankle fracture in 2001. No aggravation opinion was provided.

The Board finds that a remand is warranted to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors to obtain outstanding relevant private treatment records and an adequate addendum opinion.

First, the Board notes there appear to be outstanding private treatment records related to the Veteran's 2012 back surgery that are potentially relevant to the etiology of the claimed low back condition. Specifically, the Veteran identified a private spine physician at the November 2023 VA examination (Barrow Brain and Spine) who advised him to undergo surgery. The Board can locate no evidence, however, of any records from this provider or any provider related to the Veteran's 2012 back surgery. A remand is required to allow VA to obtain authorization and request these treatment records.

Next, the Board finds the VA examiner's opinion inadequate, warranting a remand for an addendum opinion. The examiner's opinion applies an incorrect legal standard for secondary service connection, as "proximate" causation is not required. See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (but-for causation is undisputedly broader than proximate cause). Moreover, there was no opinion provided with respect to the potential aggravation of his claimed lower back condition by his service-connected hip condition. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140-41 (2013). The opinion was also speculative and conclusory, as the examiner did not apply the specific facts of the Veteran's case to the genetic and environmental factors discussed as causative of IVDS. See Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 54, 60-61 (2018) (holding that a medical opinion was inadequate as a matter of law because the rationale was based solely on general articles and did not discuss any facts pertaining to Veteran's condition or individual circumstances); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (stating that "The Board must be able to conclude that a medical expert has applied valid medical analysis to the significant facts of the particular case in order to reach the conclusion submitted in the medical opinion).

The Board cannot make a fully-informed decision on the issue of service connection without an adequate VA opinion on whether the Veteran's low back condition is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) caused by, aggravated by, or would not have occurred but for a service-connected disability, to specifically include his service-connected left hip condition. As such, the matter is remanded for an addendum and opinion.

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 in order to obtain private treatment records from Barrow Brain and Spine and/or any other provider the Veteran identifies to have performed his 2012 back surgery. Make two requests for the authorized records unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's low back condition is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) caused by, aggravated by, or would not have occurred but for a service-connected disability, to specifically include his service-connected left hip condition?

The opinion must address aggravation. Under Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023), when addressing aggravation of non-service-connected disabilities, it is enough to show that "but for" the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, any incremental-increase in severity of the Veteran's condition would not have occurred.
