REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for hypothyroidism is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1993 to June 1996. 

The Veteran filed an original disability claim in December 2022, which was denied by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in July 2023. 

Also in July 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, higher level review (HLR) appeal, which was denied by the AOJ in August 2023.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and hypothyroidism any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for hypothyroidism is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and hypothyroidism are etiologically related to his time in service, in Haiti, where he participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), from September 27, 1994, to November 22, 1994, where he states that he was exposed to burn pits. See December 2022 VA 21-526EZ. 

By way of background, the August 2023 AOJ rating decision favorably found that the Veteran had current disabilities of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and hypothyroidism and that participation in a TERA was conceded, based on service in Haiti from September 27, 1994, to November 22, 1994. 

Notably, an April 2023 memorandum shows that the Veteran participated in a TERA while serving in Haiti from September 27, 1994 to November 22, 1994, but it does not indicate what chemicals or toxins the Veteran was exposed to during this service. The details concerning the exposure (e.g., the type(s) of chemicals the Veteran was exposed to) are pertinent to this claim.  Significantly, while VA medical opinions were obtained in this case, negative nexus opinions were provided as the specific place, activity, duration, route, and frequency of the Veteran's exposure was "unknown." 

The AOJ fell short of verifying the Veteran's specific TERA exposures prior to obtaining a medical opinion before adjudication of the claim. This constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error. On remand, the AOJ must provide details as to the Veteran's nature and level of exposure to the TERA, and complete any necessary development arising from the results.

Accordingly, the matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Arrange for all development deemed necessary and make a formal finding for the record regarding the Veteran's exposure to toxic chemicals, to include possible exposure to burn pits while in Haiti, from September 27, 1994, to November 22, 1994. The final report may take the form of an Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER).

The Board notes that while burn pits were primarily a problem in Southwest Asia,?many veterans have reported exposure to burn pits during deployments to Haiti, specifically during Operation Uphold Democracy in 1994.?See https://history.state.gov/milestones/1993-2000/haiti. This covers the time period where this Veteran served in Haiti.
