ORDER

Entitlement to restoration of a reduction of the rating assigned to service-connected sinusitis from 50 percent disabling to noncompensable, effective August 27, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In the January 2023 rating decision, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), in pertinent part, proposed to reduce the rating assigned to the Veteran's service-connected sinusitis from 50 percent disabling to noncompensable, effective August 27, 2020.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim of entitlement to restoration of a reduction of the rating assigned to service-connected sinusitis from 50 percent disabling to noncompensable, effective August 27, 2020, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from December 1971 to October 1975.

By a January 2023 rating decision, the AOJ proposed to reduce the rating assigned to the Veteran's service-connected sinusitis from 50 percent disabling to noncompensable, effective August 27, 2020.  The Veteran submitted a February 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), electing Direct Review of the January 2023 rating decision.  

Entitlement to restoration of a reduction of the rating assigned to service-connected sinusitis from 50 percent disabling to noncompensable, effective August 27, 2020.

By way of background, the Veteran filed an October 2021 claim of entitlement to an increased rating for his service-connected sinusitis.  In a January 2022 rating decision, the AOJ proposed to reduce the rating assigned to such.  The Veteran filed an April 2022 Decision Review Request:  Higher Level Review for the January 2022 rating decision, to which the AOJ addressed in a May 2022 letter informing the Veteran that his April 2022 Higher Level Review request was premature as no reduction had been made.  

In July 2022, the AOJ decreased the rating assigned to service-connected sinusitis from 50 percent disabling to noncompensable, effective October 1, 2022.  The Veteran filed an August 2022 Decision Review Request:  Higher Level Review for the July 2022 rating decision.  In the January 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found clear and unmistakable error in the July 2022 rating decision and restored the 50 percent for service-connected sinusitis, effective October 1, 2022.  The AOJ also proposed to reduce the rating again, from 50 percent disabling to noncompensable, effective August 27, 2020.  By an April 2023 rating decision, issued after the Veteran's February 2023 VA Form 10182 as to the January 2023 rating decision, the AOJ indeed reduced the rating assigned for service-connected sinusitis from 50 percent disabling to noncompensable, effective August 27, 2020.  

From this, there was a proposal in the January 2023 rating decision to reduce the rating assigned to the Veteran's service-connected sinusitis from 50 percent disabling to noncompensable, effective August 27, 2020.  The Veteran's February 2023 VA Form 10182 was in response to a proposed reduction.  However, this is not an appealable decision, as it is not a final action by the AOJ.  

As such, at the time of the Veteran's February 2023 VA Form 10182, there was no initial decision with regard to the reduction of the rating assigned to the Veteran's service-connected sinusitis, and the identified January 2023 rating decision is not an appealable decision under 38 U.S.C. § 511, as a proposed reduction does not decide any questions of law or fact.  Accordingly, the reduction issue is dismissed as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
