ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence of record is at least evenly balanced to suggest that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss first manifested during, or else is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) otherwise directly attributable to, active duty service.

2. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence of record is at least evenly balanced to suggest that the Veteran has a valid diagnosis of tinnitus during the appellate period, and it is directly attributable to active duty service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from February 1972 to February 1974.  The claims on appeal come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a February 9, 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the November 30, 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

In the June 3, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 9, 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) post-HLR supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the RAMP supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300,?20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran submitted an etiological opinion concurrently with his June 2024 VA Form 10182.  The submission of evidence with a Direct Review docket election can require the Board to seek clarification from the Veteran. See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023) (when a veteran selects the direct docket but nevertheless submits evidence with the 10182, the docket election is unclear under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f)).  Instead of causing unnecessary delay in obtaining this clarification, the Board will simply not consider this concurrent evidence, but still grant the claims in full, even without this evidence.  Adjudicating the claims in this way ensures that the Veteran is not prejudiced in any manner, while also ensuring that no improper evidence is unlawfully used in favor of the claim. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, 3.304. Service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Walker v. Shinseki, 701 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In addition, for certain chronic diseases, such as organic diseases of the nervous system, a presumption of service connection arises if the disease is manifested to a degree of 10 percent within one year following discharge from service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). When a chronic disease is not shown within one year after service, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) for the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support a claim for such diseases; however, such continuity of symptomatology may only support a claim for those chronic diseases listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  In an October 4, 1995, opinion, VA's Under Secretary for Health determined that it was appropriate to consider high frequency sensorineural hearing loss an organic disease of the nervous system and therefore a presumptive disability.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that §§ 1110 and 1131's requirement of the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary); see also McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 323 (2007) (holding that the requirement of a current disability is met when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim). Consequently, the evidence of record must show that the Veteran currently has the disability for which benefits are being claimed.

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

For service connection, it is not required that a hearing loss disability by the standards of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 be demonstrated during service, although a hearing loss disability by these standards must be currently present, and service connection is possible if the current hearing loss disability can be adequately linked to service. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant; however, if the evidence of record is persuasive for or against the claim, then the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is instead adjudicated in accordance with the evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  As pertinent to this Veteran's claims on appeal, the Veteran has valid diagnoses of both bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes and tinnitus; meanwhile, in-service exposure to hazardous noise has been conceded, through his military occupational specialty of rifleman (0311). See Rating Decision (Feb. 9, 2024); C&P Exam (Sept. 23, 2022); 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); Form DD-214 (rec'd June 21, 2017), at Question No. 16a. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

On September 23, 2022, the Veteran underwent audiometric testing. See C&P Exam (Sept. 23, 2022, rec'd Sept. 26, 2022).  The authorized VA examination audiogram is associated with the claims file.  The results are reproduced below:

 	 	 	HERTZ 	 	 

 	500 	1000 	2000 	3000 	4000 

RIGHT 	20	25	25	60	65

LEFT 	20	25	30	60	60

Speech discrimination scores using the Maryland CNC word list were as follows: for the right ear, 84 percent; left ear, 82 percent.  As shown here, audiometric testing results as of this date did demonstrate hearing loss in each ear that is recognizable for VA compensation purposes. 38?C.F.R. §?3.385.  Each ear happens to have one auditory threshold (among those specified by regulation) at 40 decibels or greater, and each ear also happens to have a sufficiently low speech discrimination score. 

With respect to an in-service onset, the Veteran is competent to testify about matters pertaining to his duties pursuant to his military occupational specialty (MOS). 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  His MOS was rifleman (0311), as listed on his Form DD-214.  This MOS has a "high" probability of noise exposure, but since the AOJ has already conceded that an in-service occurrence took place, the Board accepts those previous, favorable findings as binding.

The last remaining element is the nexus, i.e.: whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the current hearing loss is etiologically related to the in-service acoustic injury.  With regards to nexus, the Board notes that the record only contains one remaining etiology opinion (which happens to be negative) which must be considered and weighed. See Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 69-70 (1993) (citing Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192-93 (1992)). See also Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-471 (1993) (stating that the probative value of medical evidence is based on the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion the physician reaches; as is true of any evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to medical opinions are within the province of the Board). When faced with conflicting medical opinions, the Board may favor one medical opinion over the other. See Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 (1998), citing Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995). 

In developing this claim, the AOJ had previously found Duty to Assist errors, so the Board will ignore all etiological opinions given before the Higher-Level Review Return. See VA Form 20-0999 Higher-Level Review Return (rec'd Feb. 14, 2023).  In the AOJ's attempts to rectify these errors, they obtained the following negative etiological opinion on April 28, 2023:

The claimed condition is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. Rationale is veteran reported that the hearing loss occurred while performing his duties as a rifleman, which had a high probability for hazardous noise exposure, and was exposed to weapons fire to include machine guns, explosions, and military vehicle noise during his time in military service. Noise levels associated with weapons fire to include machine guns, explosions, and military vehicle noise are known to exceed the safe levels of noise exposure, especially without the use of hearing protection, and can result in noise induced hearing loss. His enlistment exam and separation exam show normal hearing and no significant hearing changes during service.  His post-military history is significant for noise exposure in that he worked in the oilfields for 8 years and was exposed to heavy machinery with the use of hearing protection. His hearing loss was found many years after service which is consistent with hearing loss due to age and post service noise exposures. His [bilateral] hearing loss is less likely than not caused by his military service.

See C&P Exam (Apr. 28, 2023), at Section III, Page 2 of 4, Question No. 3 et seq.

The Board concludes that the portion of the conclusion that states "His enlistment exam and separation exam show [...] no significant hearing changes during service" is a bare assertion without sufficient explanatory rationale. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A] medical opinion... must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions.").  Meanwhile, the portion that states "His hearing loss was found many years after service which is consistent with hearing loss due to age and post service noise exposures" appears to be based upon a lack of evidenced hearing problems. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (an examination was inadequate where the examiner did not comment on a veteran's reports of in-service injury and instead relied on the absence of evidence in a veteran's service treatment records to provide a negative opinion).  This is not adequate rationale.  

Finally, the Board cannot ignore that on February 14, 2023, duty to assist errors were specifically found in that "details of this work [for eight years post-service at the oilfield] are unknown.  What is known is that your MOS of a Rifleman is highly probable for noise exposure, and the opinion should have focused more on that in the rational[e] rather than a variable post service that is [un]known."  The Board still does not know exactly what degree of hazardous noise was present at the oilfield, nor what degree of hearing protection was available to the Veteran.  If the AOJ continued to improperly overvalue the oilfield noise and/or improperly undervalue the MOS noise, see, e.g.: Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458 (1993) (medical opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value), then the Board will finally resolve this reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor.

For all the above reasons, the Board assigns the April 2023 examiner's etiological opinion infinitesimal probative weight, while thoroughly discounting all etiological opinions given prior to when the duty to assist errors were identified.  Instead, the Board will determine that the current hearing loss diagnosis is valid, the in-service acoustic injury is conceded, the Veteran is otherwise competent to testify about circumstances related to his MOS, see 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a), he is competent to testify about symptoms that he can observe, such as a decrease in his hearing acuity since active duty service, see, e.g.: Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993), and there is no affirmative evidence that directly contradicts the Veteran's contentions.

Under these circumstances, the Board is balancing one negative VA etiological opinion that is not probative against the Veteran's testimony that hearing loss was caused by exposure to ammunition during active duty service and has continued to the present day.  The Board has no reason to impugn the Veteran's credibility.  The Board is also precluded from remanding a claim for the purpose of obtaining negative evidence against a claim, see Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003).  Instead, the Board will grant the claim for service connection now, and the Veteran cannot possibly be prejudiced by such an adjudication, see Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  

As such, upon review of this record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is related to his service.  The appeal therefore must be GRANTED.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).  There is no further doubt to be resolved because that represents a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal.

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

Where a Veteran served for at least 90 days during a period of war or after December 31, 1964, and manifests certain chronic diseases, including organic diseases of the nervous system, to a degree of 10 percent within one year, respectively, from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  In an October 4, 1995, opinion, VA's Under Secretary for Health determined that it was appropriate to consider high frequency sensorineural hearing loss an organic disease of the nervous system, and therefore a presumptive chronic disability.  The Board also notes that in Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims determined that tinnitus is an "organic disease of the nervous system" subject to presumptive service connection where there is evidence of acoustic trauma and nerve damage.

The Veteran's current diagnosis of tinnitus is not in dispute. See generally C&P Exam (Sept. 23, 2022); Rating Decision (Feb. 9, 2024).  It is also undisputed that the Veteran was exposed to acoustic trauma during service in performance his MOS. See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); Form DD-214 (rec'd June 21, 2017), at Question No. 16a.  Similarly, the Board has granted the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss, above.  The only remaining question is whether the Veteran's tinnitus had onset in service or is otherwise related to his period of active duty service.

In sum and substance, the April 2023 examiner provided the same etiological opinion, with the same negative rationale, for tinnitus as was given for hearing loss.  Now that hearing loss is service connected, the Board might otherwise be required to remand for a new opinion, as to whether tinnitus is secondary to hearing loss. See generally Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (issues are "inextricably intertwined" when a decision on one issue would have a "significant impact" on a Veteran's claim for the second issue).  Meanwhile, tinnitus is a disorder that is capable of lay diagnosis.  See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007).  The Veteran is therefore competent to report his ongoing experience of tinnitus since service.  Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, he is also competent to testify that tinnitus began in March 1972, which is shortly after his February 1972 induction to active duty service. See C&P Exam (Sept. 23, 2022), at Page 6 of 9, Section 2 (Tinnitus), Question No. 2, first sentence of paragraph starting under the word "Rationale.").

If the Board were to deny the claim for any reason, then a denial would be based upon an absence of evidence from the record, and such a denial would be inadequate. See Dalton, supra. See also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (2006); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (2007).  Regardless, as stated above, the Board cannot deny the claim for tinnitus at this time, because tinnitus may be secondary to hearing loss that is now determined as service connected.  With the remaining choices of either remanding this claim as inextricably intertwined, or granting the claim for service connection in full, the Board will ultimately resolve all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, see Lynch, supra, and grant the claim.   Even if tinnitus might arguably be intertwined with hearing loss, the Board is also precluded from remanding a claim for the sole purpose of obtaining negative evidence against a claim.  See Mariano v. Principi, 7 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003).   Ultimately, the Veteran cannot be prejudiced by granting this claim in full. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  Granting the claim on a direct basis or secondary basis would each constitute a grant in full, so with no advantage between those two options, the Board will choose to grant on a direct basis, taking the Veteran at his word that tinnitus manifested as early as March 1972-during active duty service.

Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the evidence both for and against his claim is at the very least approximately evenly balanced; therefore, the claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus must be GRANTED.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
