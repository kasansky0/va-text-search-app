DOCKET NO. 240305-422472
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

1. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is service connected, in relevant part, for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at 70 percent, right knee degenerative osteoarthritis at 10 percent, and left knee strain with tendonitis and patellofemoral pain syndrome at 10 percent; they have reasonably shown to have been of a nature and severity that rendered the Veteran unable to maintain regular, substantially gainful employment consistent with his education and experience.

2. The Veteran's OSA is not related to his military service or his service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The schedular criteria for a TDIU rating are met, and a TDIU rating is warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.15, 4.16.

2. The criteria for service connection for OSA have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 2009 to January 2013 and from June 2018 to July 2020. Notably, the Veteran earned the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with two campaign stars.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from multiple rating decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal which are February 2024 (TDIU) and March 2024 (OSA). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to a TDIU.

The Veteran asserts he is unable to work due to his service-connected disabilities. See February 2023 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.

Legal Criteria

Entitlement to a TDIU may be granted where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or higher, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or higher, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or higher. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

Total disability will be considered to exist when there is impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation; provided that permanent total disability shall be taken to exist when the impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person. 38 C.F.R. § 4.15.

Substantially gainful employment is defined as work that is more than marginal and that permits the individual to earn a living wage. Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991). In Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) defined substantially gainful employment as "an occupation that provides an annual income that exceeds the poverty threshold for one person, irrespective of the number of hours or days that the Veteran actually works and without regard to the Veteran's earned annual income."

The sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough; a high rating (in itself) is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment. Rather, the dispositive question is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether the Veteran can find employment.

In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his age or impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19. In a claim for a TDIU, the ultimate question of whether a Veteran is capable of substantially gainful employment is not a medical one; that determination instead is for the adjudicator. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38?C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b). When the evidence persuasively favors against the claim of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38?U.S.C. §?5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Factual Background and Analysis

The Board notes the Veteran was awarded a combined rating of 100 percent effective November 27, 2023. A 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a veteran is totally disabled. Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994) (citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990)). If a veteran is totally disabled as a result of a particular service-connected disability or combination of disabilities pursuant to the rating schedule, there is no need, and no authority, to rate the Veteran otherwise totally disabled on any other basis. See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding a request for TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period).

Thus, the period on review for the TDIU claim in this matter is from the date VA received the TDIU claim through the date the Veteran received a combined 100 percent rating, or February 2, 2023, through November 27, 2023. (See above for analysis of evidence available for review based on the docket selected by the Veteran).

The Veteran is service connected as follows: PTSD at 70 percent, radiculopathy right upper extremity (dominant) at 40 percent, radiculopathy left upper extremity (non-dominant) at 30 percent, cervical strain at 30 percent, rotator cuff tendonitis of left shoulder at 20 percent, right knee degenerative osteoarthritis at 10 percent, left knee strain with tendonitis and patellofemoral pain syndrome at 10 percent, asthma at 10 percent, and he is rated at noncompensable for chronic constipation, right knee scar, dermatophytosis claimed as athlete's foot, right shin splint, and right knee instability (associated with right knee degenerative osteoarthritis).  

In the February 2024 rating decision, the RO made a favorable finding that the Veteran met the schedular criteria for entitlement to a TDIU. Therefore, the schedular rating requirement for a TDIU in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) is met. The February 2024 rating decision highlighted that the Veteran was not working and identified it as a favorable finding. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran worked full time, approximately 50 hours per week, for Capstone Logistics as a warehouse worker/selector from August 1, 2022, to November 18, 2022. See February 2023 VA Form 21-4192. The Veteran was terminated as he was not able to perform the tasks at hand due to his disabilities. See id. There was another VA Form 21-4192 from January 2023 submitted for Capstone Logistics with slightly different information regarding the Veteran's position, amount earned, and reason for termination. However, as the two forms were filled out by different employees of the company, the Board acknowledges the differences and finds them inconsequential to the holistic analysis of the Veteran's employment. The January 2023 VA Form 21-4192 described the Veteran as "mental was not there, quit without notice."   

From August 24, 2021, to April 21, 2022, the Veteran worked as a contract driver for CircYoulation, Inc, with variable hours. See March 2023 VA Form 21-4192. According to the company, the Veteran quit this position. 

From November 23, 2020, to February 4, 2021, the Veteran was a Detention Officer at the Cumberland County Sherriff Office where he worked 12-hour swing shifts for approximately 42.5 hours per week. See June 2021 VA Form 21-4192. The Veteran resigned this position "due to my injuries sustained while serving in the US Army." Veteran statement. The Veteran's spouse submitted a statement detailing that the Veteran gave up his job due to the excruciating pain caused by walking up and down stairs all day or standing for long periods of time. See February 2021 Spouse's statement.

The Veteran asserts that since becoming too disabled to work, he tried to secure employment as a probation officer with the Atlanta Department of Community Supervision. See February 2023 Application for Increased Compensation. The record is silent as to why the Veteran was not selected for this position. He also described having only some college training for his education. See id. 

In a February 2023 VA examination for PTSD, the Veteran described having quit or lost close to 10 jobs since leaving the military. The examiner reported the Veteran as having decreased function in occupational roles, and he becomes anxious and irritable at times. The VA examiner also documented that the Veteran's symptoms of PTSD cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 

The Veteran was afforded a knee VA examination in March 2023. The VA examiner documented that the functional impact of the Veteran's knee condition is a decreased ability to squat, traverse stairs, and an inability to sit, walk, or stand for prolonged periods due to pain and stiffness. The examiner further notated that there would be a need for more frequent breaks if the Veteran was on his feet a lot at work. The overall functional impact of the Veteran's knee condition would affect both standing and seated occupations.  

The Veteran was afforded an additional knee VA examination in July 2023. The VA examiner documented that the Veteran's flare-ups prevent him from driving, walking, standing, going up steps, squatting, and working out. The Veteran further reported that he can't run, go up steps, he struggles to switch between pedals while driving, and he can't squat at all. The examiner also documented that the Veteran is limited by activities that require prolonged walking, climbing stairs, prolonged driving, or squatting during flare-ups as his knee pain produces a decrease in productivity and efficiency. 

In June 2022, the Veteran requested a letter showing he can still work despite having disabilities. See June 2022 VA treatment note. This request establishes the Veteran continued to seek employment opportunities.  

?

The Board finds the Veteran is unable to maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities. The Veteran's primary work experiences have been in law enforcement and as a driver. The February 2023 VA examination confirms that the Veteran has decreased function in occupational roles due to his service-connected PTSD. The multiple knee VA examinations received during the period on review suggest the Veteran is limited by his service-connected knee condition to sit, stand, or walk for prolonged periods of time, and he is limited in his ability to traverse stairs. These limitations negatively impact a job in law enforcement, where the Veteran has experience. The knee conditions also impact the Veteran's capacity to alternate between pedals while driving, ultimately making a job as a driver difficult. 

While the Veteran could probably obtain substantially gainful employment in an online, remote, or predominately seated position, he is unlikely to maintain such employment due to the restrictions for sitting and standing.  

Resolving reasonable doubt in his favor (as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.102), the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD and knee conditions were reasonably shown to have been of a nature and severity that rendered the Veteran unable to maintain regular, substantially gainful employment consistent with his education and experience. A TDIU is therefore warranted.

2. Service connection for OSA.

The Veteran asserts his OSA is caused by his service-connected PTSD. See November 2023 Application for Disability Compensation.

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38?C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b). When the evidence persuasively favors against the claim of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38?U.S.C. §?5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Direct Theory of Entitlement

In order to establish entitlement to service connection for a disability, a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship ("nexus") between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). Lay evidence cannot be determined to be not credible merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Competent lay evidence can be sufficient on its own to establish any element of a claim. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In order to be competent, the individual must have personal knowledge, derived from his/her own senses, of what is being attested; "[c]ompetent testimony is thus limited to that which the witness has actually observed, and is within the realm of his personal knowledge." Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 471 (1994).

In the March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ identified a diagnosis of OSA as a favorable finding. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. Accordingly, the first element of service connection has been met. 

Upon review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs), there is no evidence of OSA or its related symptoms such as difficulty sleeping, snoring, or gasping while sleeping. However, the Veteran reported the OSA began in 2012, while in service, with symptoms of snoring, waking up during the night, and excessive daytime drowsiness. See January 2024 VA examination. The Board finds the Veteran competent and credible to report the onset of these symptoms. Accordingly, the second element of service connection has been met.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2023, where the examiner opined the Veteran's OSA was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the Veteran's service. The examiner based this opinion on the lack of complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for a sleep apnea condition while in service. The Board acknowledges that a VA examiner may not generally rely on absence of evidence as negative evidence. See Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272-75 (2015). However, in the rationale, the examiner included a review of pertinent records in their opinion, including VA treatment records showing pain that interferes with the Veteran's sleep. As such, the examiner did not solely rely on the absence of evidence for their opinion. The Board finds the VA examination adequate for rating purposes but assigns it low probative weight.   

Here, there is no medical nexus that connects the Veteran's current OSA to the symptoms he experienced in service. Accordingly, service connection on a direct basis is not warranted.

Secondary Theory of Entitlement

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis. This requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc); see also Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (invalidating the requirement of "proximate cause" and instead held a "but for" causation or aggravation is enough to show entitlement to secondary service connection). 

Secondary service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) is warranted where a non-service-connected disability would have been less severe but for a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability. See Spicer, 61 F.4th at 1364.

The Veteran specifically asserts his OSA is caused by his service-connected PTSD. The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2024 for a medical opinion as to the secondary nature of the Veteran's OSA. The examiner opined that the Veteran's OSA is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected PTSD. The examiner's rationale described OSA as an obstructive process of the oral-pharyngeal airway, a separate and unrelated entity to the PTSD that does not cause physical airway obstruction. The examiner completed a full review of the Veteran's electronic VA record and described specific symptoms experienced by this Veteran. Accordingly, the Board finds the March 2024 medical opinion adequate for rating purposes and assigns it high probative weight. 

The record does not support, and the Veteran has not argued, that his OSA was aggravated by his service-connected PTSD. 

The Board finds the Veteran's OSA is not proximately due to or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD. Accordingly, service connection for OSA on a secondary basis is not warranted. 

Presumptive Theory of Entitlement

Certain chronic diseases may be service connected on a presumptive basis if manifested to a compensable degree within a specified period following separation from service (one year for organic diseases of the nervous system). 38 U.S.C. § 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. For chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), nexus to service may be established by showing continuity of symptomatology since service. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338-40 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

OSA is not a disease identified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309. Additionally, the Veteran received a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) examination in April 2024. The VA examiner opined the Veteran's OSA was less likely than not caused by TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran. The examiner's rationale described no medical or scientific evidence available that provides any indication of a relationship between the development of OSA and the TERA. The TERA examination included a detailed documentation of the Veteran's deployments and possible TERAs, and included a thorough review of the Veteran's record. As such, the Board finds this examination adequate for rating purposes and assigns it high probative weight. Accordingly, service connection on a presumptive basis is not warranted.

Service connection for OSA fails under every theory of entitlement. Therefore, the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply, and service connection for OSA must be denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
