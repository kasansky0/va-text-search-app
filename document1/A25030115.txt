REMANDED

Whether the termination of VA compensation and pension benefits based on fugitive felon status was proper is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

This matter is on appeal from a March 2024 notification letter by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The law prohibits the payment of compensation benefits or pension for any period during which a veteran is a fugitive felon. 38 C.F.R. § 5313B, 38 C.F.R. § 3.666(e).  

The term fugitive felon means a person who is a fugitive by reason of: (i) fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, for an offense, or an attempt to commit an offense, which is a felony under the laws of the place from which the person flees; or, (ii) violating a condition of probation or parole imposed for commission of a felony under Federal or State law. The term felony includes a high misdemeanor under the laws of a State which characterizes as high misdemeanors offenses that would be felony offenses under Federal law.  38 C.F.R. § 3.665(n).

The statute barring Veterans from receiving VA benefits while they are "fugitive felons," does not require an adjudication of guilt or knowledge of the outstanding arrest warrant. Mountford v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 443 (2011).

In June 2014, the Undersecretary for Benefits of the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) issued fugitive felon policy and procedures.  VBA Letter 20-14-09 (June 23, 2014).  VBA Letter 20-14-09 indicates that VBA previously presumed that a beneficiary was a fugitive felon if the beneficiary was the subject of any felony arrest warrant.  The letter states that, effective immediately, VBA no longer presumed that any valid outstanding felony arrest warrant established a beneficiary's fugitive felon status under 38 U.S.C. § 5313B.  

The letter further states that VBA will request information only for beneficiaries who have a felony arrest warrant with a felony arrest warrant with a National Crime Information Center (NCIC) offense code indicating flight or a probation or parole violation. Those codes are:

4901 - Escape

4902 - Flight to avoid prosecution

4999 - Flight-escape

5011 - Parole violation

5012 - Probation violation

8101 - Juvenile offender abscond while on parole

8102 - Juvenile offender abscond while on probation

Thus, VA will discontinue benefits based on fugitive felon status only if: a judge issued a felony arrest warrant with a NCIC offense code indicating flight or a probation or parole violation; VA provided the beneficiary notice regarding the reason for the warrant and an opportunity to present evidence, such as an acknowledgment of the validity of the warrant or failure to respond to the due process notification, or that he or she did not flee from justice or did not violate any condition of probation or parole; and VA determines, based upon the warrant and evidence submitted by the beneficiary (if any), that the beneficiary was fleeing from justice or violated a condition of probation or parole.  

Benefits will be terminated for Veterans while they are fugitive felons and dependents of Veterans while the Veteran is a fugitive felon.

When a warrant is dismissed, recalled, or quashed, there is still a valid warrant up until the date the warrant was cleared and VA benefits are subject to adjustment from the warrant date until the date it is recalled, dismissed, or quashed, unless there was a specific determination that the warrant was void from its inception because of mistaken identity or a defect in the warrant, or the court order specifically states that the recall is effective from a specific date that is on or before the date of the warrant, or uses the terminology nunc pro tunc, which refers to changing back to an earlier date.  M21-1, Pt. X, Ch. 16.

In the March 2024 notification letter on appeal, VA indicated the Veteran's benefits were going to be withheld effective January 27, 2023 based on a felony arrest warrant for probation violation.

A previous November 2023 letter informing the Veteran of the proposal to adjust VA benefit awards indicated the warrant agency, the warrant number, and the warrant offense code.  However, underlying documents such as the warrant itself or confirmation from the warrant agency that the warrant was still valid or when the warrant was cleared was not included.

Thus, while VA complied with the requirements that instruct notice be sent to the Veteran about his due process rights (see November 2023 notice letter), the Board finds there was a pre-decisional duty to assist error because the RO did not obtain the underlying documents to verify the Veteran's fugitive felon status.  

A November 2023 FFP-3 VA Investigative Summary Form shows the warrant date to be January 27, 2023.  However, it does not show if the warrant has been cleared or not.

In December 2023, the Veteran said he had contacted the Hampton Police Department and they told him they didn't have a warrant for him. 

However, in February 2024, VA called the Hampton Police Department who said the warrant was valid from August 20, 2019 to January 27, 2023.

On remand, the underlying documents to verify the Veteran's fugitive felon status must be obtained.  

Additionally, records associated with the Veteran's file show an overpayment amount resulting from his fugitive felon status to be $17,675.13.  However, there is no audit associated with the file showing how VA determined that was the amount due and owing. 

On remand, an audit should be performed, showing how VA arrived at that amount.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the claims file a copy of the warrant issued for the Veteran as well as any other information, specifically the NCIC offense code, reflecting the nature of the Veteran's arrest warrant.

Obtain written confirmation as to whether the Veteran's warrant is still valid or if the warrant has been cleared.

The Veteran may submit additional documentation. 

2. Perform an audit of the Veteran's account and show how the overpayment amount of $17,675.13 was arrived at and draft a memo explaining the findings.
