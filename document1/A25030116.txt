REMANDED

The issue of whether the character of the Appellant's discharge from service is a bar to entitlement to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits, exclusive of health care and related benefits authorized under Chapter 17, Title 38, United States Code, is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to VA compensation for tinnitus is remanded. 

The issue of entitlement to service connection, to include for treatment purposes only under Chapter 17, Title 38, United States Code, for bilateral hearing loss is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Appellant served on active duty from July 16, 1985 to September 16, 1987. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

Historically, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) prepared a June 2021 administrative decision regarding the Appellant's character of service. A July 2021 rating decision granted service connection, for treatment purposes only under Chapter 17, Title 38, United States Code, for tinnitus. The September 2023 rating decision on appeal confirmed and continued the grant of service connection, for treatment purposes only under Chapter 17, for tinnitus and denied service connection, to include for treatment purposes only under Chapter 17, for bilateral hearing loss. The September 2023 notification letter informed the Appellant that he had not been provided a copy of the June 2021 administrative decision. 

In the September 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Appellant elected the direct review docket. As such, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the decision on appeal (September 18, 2023). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. Because these matters are being remanded, any evidence that is not considered by the Board at this time will be considered by the AOJ upon readjudication of this claim.

The initial question for the Board is the scope of the instant appeal. The September 2023 rating decision on appeal confirmed and continued the grant of service connection, for treatment purposes only, under Chapter 17 and stated that "Compensation is not payable for this condition."  This rating decision then cited to 38 C.F.R. § 3.360, related to discharges under other than honorable conditions. While the Appellant did not specifically appeal the character of his discharge, the essential issue before the Board is whether the Appellant's service is honorable for VA purposes. Accordingly, the Board has determined that the issue of the Appellant's character of service is a part and parcel of the instant appeal and has recharacterized the issues on appeal accordingly. See Murphy v. Wilkie, 983 F.3d 1313, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2020); see also Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 256 (2007). 

Character of Discharge And Tinnitus Claims

The Board finds that remand is appropriate to satisfy a statutory or regulatory duty that has a reasonable possibility of substantiating the Appellant's claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Specifically, 38 C.F.R. 3.12, which governs eligibility to VA benefits based on the character of a claimant's discharge, was amended effective June 25, 2024. 89 Fed. Reg. 32361 (2024). The Supplementary Information to this regulatory change states that "When this rule becomes effective, any claimant with a prior unfavorable COD determination, to include the no longer used undesirable discharge, may request a new COD determination under new §?3.12." 

Given the foregoing, the Board finds that a new character of discharge determination must be issued under the revised 38 C.F.R. § 3.12. 

The matter of entitlement to compensation for tinnitus is inextricably intertwined with the issue of whether the Appellant's period of service from July 16, 1985 to September 16, 1987, exclusive of health care and related benefits authorized under Chapter 17, Title 38, United States Code, is a bar to entitlement to VA benefits. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (two or more issues are inextricably intertwined if one claim could have significant impact on the other). Therefore, this claim must also be remanded.

Bilateral The September 2023 rating decision relied on a June 2023 VA audiology examination and opinion. This opinion, in part, states that the examiner was unable to find any audiograms other than those dated May 1987 and June 1987. However, the claims file contains an entrance audiogram dated May 1985. Therefore, the Board finds that this opinion is inadequate. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460-61 (1993) (medical opinion based on inaccurate factual premise may properly be rejected as non-probative); D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 104 (2008) (holding that a medical opinion must be based on a veteran's prior medical history); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 303 (2008) (Board may properly consider the failure of a medical examiner to conduct complete and accurate review of the c-file where it explains why a review was "necessary or important in forming the appropriate medical judgment").

This remand is required to cure a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Issue a new character of discharge determination under the revised provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.12.  The Veteran and his representative, if any, should be issued proper notification of this decision and provided with the appropriate appellate rights.

2. Schedule the Appellant for a VA audiology examination. The claims folder must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner. All tests deemed necessary should be conducted and the results reported in detail. 

During the course of this examination, the examiner must obtain information regarding the Appellant's noise exposure before, during and after military service, as well as information regarding onset of hearing loss symptomatology and the course of symptoms since onset of symptoms.  

After examination and review of the claims file, the examiner should opine whether any bilateral hearing loss disability found under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 began during service, within one year of discharge therefrom, or is otherwise the result of military service.  

The examiner is reminded that merely a lack of any noted hearing loss in service is not an adequate basis on which to base any negative opinion, and the examiner must focus on whether any hearing loss found is related to service, to include noise exposure therein.

If the Appellant's hearing loss is not found to be directly related to service, the examiner should opine whether the Appellant's bilateral hearing loss is (a) caused by; or, (b) aggravated (i.e., worsened) by the Appellant's tinnitus. 

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for all opinions rendered. The examiner is reminded that separate and distinct opinions with supporting rationales should be provided for all theories of entitlement addressed, particular secondary causation and secondary aggravation.
