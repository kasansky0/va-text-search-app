FINDING OF FACT

The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran incurred an additional right shoulder, left shoulder, right hip, left hip, right knee, or left knee disability caused by carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in furnishing treatment, or an event not reasonably foreseeable. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right shoulder disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 1151; 38 C.F.R. § 3.361.

2. The criteria for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a left shoulder disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 1151; 38 C.F.R. § 3.361.

3. The criteria for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right hip disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 1151; 38 C.F.R. § 3.361.

4. The criteria for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a left hip disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 1151; 38 C.F.R. § 3.361.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on active duty from November 1977 to June 1992.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2020 rating decision of a VA Regional Office (RO).

In May 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) and requested a hearing before the Board.  An August 2024 letter advised the Veteran that a hearing was scheduled for October 2024.  However, the Veteran did not appear for the scheduled Board hearing and has not requested rescheduling.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2020 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran within 90 days following the date of the scheduled hearing.  38?C.F.R. §?20.302(c).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the RO issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date of the scheduled Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the date of the scheduled hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(c), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the claims for service connection for right and left knee strain, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

As an aside, the Board acknowledges that in a January 2021 VA 21-0820 Report of General Information, a VA representative noted that the "Veteran and attorney called..." and in his May 2021 VA Form 10182, the Veteran noted that his representative's name was Travis N. Barrick, Esq.  Notably, there is no signed VA Form 21-22a, Appointment of Individual as Claimant's Representative, in the Veteran's claims file.  Accordingly, in February 2025, the Board sent a letter to the Veteran asking him to clarify his representation.  To date, the Veteran has not responded to the clarification letter.  Therefore, in the absence of a completed VA Form 21-22 or 21-22a, the Board will assume that the Veteran wishes to represent himself. 

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b).

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the appellant and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015).

Claims for Compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151

A veteran who suffers disability resulting from hospital care or medical or surgical treatment provided by a VA employee or in a VA facility is entitled to compensation for the additional disability in the same manner as if such additional disability were service-connected if the additional disability was not the result of willful misconduct and was proximately caused by carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of VA in furnishing that treatment, or an event not reasonably foreseeable.  38 U.S.C. § 1151; 38 C.F.R. § 3.361; Viegas v. Shinseki, 705 F.3d 1374, 1377-78 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  The purpose of the statute is to award benefits to those veterans who were disabled because of VA treatment or vocational rehabilitation.  38 U.S.C. § 1151(a).

First, there must be evidence of additional disability, as shown by comparing the veteran's condition before and after the VA medical care in question.  38 C.F.R. § 3.361(b).  To determine whether a veteran has an additional disability, VA compares the veteran's condition immediately before the beginning of the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, training and rehabilitation services, or compensated work therapy (CWT) program upon which the claim is based to the veteran's condition after such care, treatment, examination, services, or program has stopped.  VA considers each body part or system separately.  The additional disability must not be the result of the veteran's willful misconduct.  38 U.S.C. § 1151(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(c)(3).

Second, the additional disability must be caused by hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, training and rehabilitation services, or CWT program furnished the veteran by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.361(c).  For an additional disability to be compensable under 38 U.S.C. § 1151, the additional disability must have been actually caused by, and not merely coincidental to, hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or medical examination furnished by a VA employee or in a VA facility.  Merely showing that a veteran received care, treatment, or examination and that the veteran has an additional disability does not establish cause.  38 C.F.R. § 3.361(c)(1).  The Federal Circuit has held that the causation element of section 1151 is satisfied not only when an injury is "directly" or "actually" caused by the actions of VA employees, but also where an injury occurs in a VA facility resulting from VA's negligence.  See Viegas, 705 F.3d at 1378.

Hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination cannot cause the continuance or natural progress of a disease of injury for which the care or treatment was furnished unless VA's failure to timely diagnose and properly treat the disease or injury proximately caused the continuance or natural progress.  38 C.F.R. § 3.361(c)(2).  The factual elements necessary to support a claim under section 1151 based on failure to diagnose or treat a preexisting condition may vary with the facts of each case and the nature of the particular injury and cause alleged by the claimant.  As a general matter, however, entitlement to benefits based on such claims would ordinarily require a determination that: (1) VA failed to diagnose and/or treat a preexisting disease or injury; (2) a physician exercising the degree of skill and care ordinarily required of the medical profession reasonably should have diagnosed the condition and rendered treatment; and (3) the veteran suffered disability or death which probably would have been avoided if proper diagnosis and treatment had been rendered.  See VAOGCPREC 5-2001 (Feb. 5, 2001); see also Roberson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d 809, 817 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  

The Board acknowledges that the above three elements necessary to establish a section 1151 claim based on VA's failure to diagnose and/or treat were delineated by VA's General Counsel in VAOPGCPREC 5-2001 as part of the version of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 that was effective for claims filed prior to October 1, 1997.  Although the law in effect at such time did not contain a "fault" requirement as it now does, the courts have determined that it is impossible to delineate proximate cause without speaking in terms of duty when considering a claim based on failure to diagnose, even for claims filed prior to the change in law.  See Roberson, 607 F.3d at 816.  As such, there has been no real change in the standard for section 1151 claims concerning a failure to diagnose and/or treat.  Therefore, the elements delineated by VA's General Counsel remain relevant to claims filed after October 1, 1997, such as in the present appeal.

VA's General Counsel has also held that an additional disability resulting from aggravation of an injury by VA medical treatment and/or failure to treat is to be compensated as though it were a service-connected disability.  As with a service-connected disability resulting from service aggravation of a pre-existing disease or injury, section 1151 compensation should be paid for only the "additional disability," i.e., the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing before the aggravation by medical treatment.  But importantly, as with a service-connected aggravation, that additional disability need not necessarily be of compensable degree in itself.  See VAOPGCPREC 4-2001 (Feb. 2, 2001); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.322(a) and 4.22.

Moreover, additional disability caused by a veteran's failure to follow properly given medical instructions is not caused by hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination.  38 C.F.R. § 3.361(c)(3).

Third, the proximate cause of the disability, as opposed to a remote contributing cause, must be: (1) carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of VA in furnishing the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination; or (2) an event that was not reasonably foreseeable.  38 U.S.C. § 1151(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(d).

To establish that carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on VA's part in furnishing hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination was the proximate cause of a veteran's additional disability or death, it must be shown that the hospital care or medical or surgical treatment caused the additional disability or death; and (1) VA failed to exercise the degree of care that would be expected of a reasonable health care provider; or (2) VA furnished the hospital care or medical or surgical treatment without the veteran's informed consent.  Determinations of whether there was informed consent involve consideration of whether the health care providers substantially complied with the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 17.32.  38 C.F.R. § 3.361(d)(1).

Regarding reasonable foreseeability, whether the proximate cause of a veteran's additional disability or death was an event not reasonably foreseeable is in each claim to be determined based on what a reasonable health care provider would have foreseen.  The event need not be completely unforeseeable or unimaginable but must be one that a reasonable health care provider would not have considered to be an ordinary risk of the treatment provided.  In determining whether an event was reasonably foreseeable, VA will consider whether the risk of that event was the type of risk that a reasonable health care provider would have foreseen or disclosed in connection with the informed consent procedures of 38 C.F.R. § 17.32.  38 C.F.R. § 3.361(d)(2); Schertz v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 362, 367-69 (2013).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  If the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, the claim is denied.

1. Entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right shoulder disability

2. Entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a left shoulder disability

3. Entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right hip disability

4. Entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a left hip disability

5. Entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right knee disability

6. Entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a left knee disability

The Veteran asserts he is entitled to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for disabilities of the right shoulder, left shoulder, right hip, left hip, right knee, and left knee.  In the May 2020 rating decision on appeal, the RO made the following favorable findings: (1) the Veteran is diagnosed with right shoulder rotator cuff repair, given a VA treatment record noting his previous surgery at a private facility in May 2003; (2) the Veteran is diagnosed with mild degenerative arthritis of the right knee; and (3) the Veteran is diagnosed with mild degenerative arthritis of the left knee.  See VA treatment records dated August 2003 to February 2020.  Having found no clear and unmistakable error, the Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Accordingly, current right shoulder, right knee, and left knee disabilities are established.

However, the existence of a current disability is not the relevant question in a claim for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151.  Rather, the relevant question is whether there is an additional disability following VA care or treatment.  Here, the Veteran has not asserted, nor does the record show, any instance(s) of VA care or treatment (or failure to diagnose or treat) that caused or aggravated any of his claimed disabilities of the right shoulder, left shoulder, right hip, left hip, right knee, and left knee.   

As noted previously, the first element of a claim for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 is that there must be evidence of additional disability, as shown by comparing the veteran's condition before and after the VA medical care in question.  To determine whether a veteran has an additional disability, VA compares the veteran's condition immediately before the beginning of the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, training and rehabilitation services, or CWT program upon which the claim is based to the veteran's condition after such care, treatment, examination, services, or program has stopped.

As the Veteran has not identified the VA care or treatment upon which his claims for compensation under 38 C.F.R. § 1151 are based, the Board is unable to compare the Veteran's disabilities before and after such care or treatment to determine if there is any additional disability.  Thus, the Veteran fails to meet the threshold element of his claims for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151.  Since there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence in these matters, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable, and the claims must be denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for right knee strain with degenerative changes is remanded.

The Veteran also asserts he is entitled to service connection for right knee strain with degenerative changes.  In the May 2020 rating decision on appeal, the RO made the following favorable findings: (1) the Veteran is diagnosed with mild degenerative arthritis of the right knee; and (2) a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during the Veteran's service, since a December 1977 service treatment record (STR) reveals he sought treatment for a twisted right knee.  See also May 2020 VA knee examination report (diagnosing the Veteran with bilateral knee strain, degenerative arthritis, and chondromalacia).  Having found no clear and unmistakable error, the Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The Board finds that remand is necessary to cure a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

In March 2020, the Veteran was provided a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his claimed right knee disability, which was documented in a May 2020 VA knee examination report.  The VA examiner provided a negative nexus opinion as to direct service connection in May 2020, reasoning, in pertinent part, "No evidence of knee condition during time of military service...THERE IS NO KNEE PATHOLOGY NOTED DURING MILITARY SERVICE."  On review, the Board finds the May 2020 VA medical opinion to be inadequate since it is based upon an inaccurate factual premise.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993).  As noted above, per a December 1977 STR, the Veteran sought treatment for a twisted right knee during service; there is no indication that the examiner reviewed and considered this in-service injury, rendering the opinion inadequate.

Prior to adjudicating the claim, the RO should have obtained an adequate VA medical opinion.  This must be accomplished on remand.

2. The Veteran asserts he is entitled to service connection for left knee strain with degenerative arthritis.  

The Veteran asserts he is entitled to service connection for left knee strain with degenerative arthritis.  In the May 2020 rating decision on appeal, the RO made a favorable finding that the Veteran was diagnosed with mild degenerative arthritis of the left knee.  Having found no clear and unmistakable error, the Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The Board finds that remand is necessary to cure a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

As noted previously, in March 2020, the Veteran was provided a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his claimed left knee disability, which was documented in a May 2020 VA knee examination report.  The VA examiner diagnosed bilateral knee strain, degenerative arthritis, and chondromalacia and noted the date of diagnosis as the date of the VA examination.  In describing the history of the Veteran's knee disability, the VA examiner wrote, "Veteran states they have difficulty going from sitting to standing.  His doctor has said that he has no cartilage left.  Veteran says that he has had pain for a long time, since Kansas.  This has impacted the [V]eteran's functionality by impacting his walking, getting up." (emphasis added).  Notably, the Veteran's DD-214 reflects that he separated from active service at Fort Riley, Kansas, and VA treatment records also reflect that the Veteran lived in Kansas for a period after service.  See, e.g., VA treatment records dated August 2016 to January 2020.  Thus, the Board finds that the medical history obtained from the May 2020 VA examiner is unclear as to the date of onset of the Veteran's knee pain.  Prior to adjudicating the claim, the RO should have obtained an additional VA examination to clarify to the approximate date of onset of the Veteran's knee pain, as well as a new VA medical opinion that considers this information.  This must be accomplished on remand.

Accordingly, the matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum VA medical opinion regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed right knee strain with degenerative changes.  The claims file, including a copy of this Remand, must be made available to, and be reviewed by, the examiner.  If another examination is indicated, one must be provided to the Veteran.

After a thorough review of the entire claims file, the examiner is asked to provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's right knee strain with degenerative changes at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) had its onset during or is otherwise related to the Veteran's active service, specifically addressing the December 1977 STR noting treatment for a twisted right knee.

2. Provide the Veteran an additional VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his claimed left knee strain with degenerative arthritis.  The claims file, including a copy of this Remand, must be made available to, and be reviewed by, the examiner.

After a review of the entire claims file, the examiner is asked to:

(a)	Elicit from the Veteran and the record the history of his knee symptoms during and since active service.  Specifically, identify the approximate date of onset of the Veteran's knee pain.  

(b)	For each currently diagnosed left knee disability, provide an opinion as to whether it at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) had its onset during or is otherwise related to the Veteran's active service.
