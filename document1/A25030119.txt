ORDER

An earlier effective date of September 30, 2007, for the award of service connection for hypersomnia is granted based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a September 2008 rating decision.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The September 2008 rating decision that denied service connection for hypersomnia became final because the Veteran did not submit a notice of disagreement, and new and material evidence was not received within the appeal period nor were new, relevant service records received at any time thereafter.

2. The statutory or regulatory provisions extant at the time of the September 2008 rating decision were not correctly applied, and the failure to correctly apply those laws and regulations was undebatable and manifestly changed the outcome of the September 2008 rating decision.

3. The Veteran filed an initial claim of entitlement to service connection for hypersomnia received by VA on October 17, 2007, within one year of service separation; entitlement to service connection for hypersomnia arose during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Clear and unmistakable error is shown in the September 2008 rating decision to the extent it did not properly apply the statutory or regulatory provisions then extant, and it is revised to reflect a grant of service connection for hypersomnia effective from September 30, 2007.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a), 3.400 (2024); 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111 (2006); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304 (2008).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, had active service in the U.S. Air Force from July 2000 to September 2007.        

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from a March 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO); the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

New evidence cannot be considered in deciding motions seeking revision or reversal of prior final decisions based on CUE, as such CUE motions must be based upon the facts and law that existed at the time of the prior decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(iii).

1. An earlier effective date of September 30, 2007, for the award of service connection for hypersomnia is granted based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a September 2008 rating decision.

This appeal arises from a January 2023 motion by the Veteran to revise a September 2008 rating decision that denied service connection for hypersomnia on the basis of CUE.  For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that there was CUE in the September 2008 rating decision and that revision of that decision to reflect a grant of service connection for hypersomnia effective from September 30, 2007, is warranted.

The Veteran in this case filed an initial claim of entitlement to service connection for hypersomnia in October 2007.  A September 2008 rating decision denied the claim, finding that hypersomnia existed prior to service and was not aggravated therein.

A previous RO determination that is final and binding will be accepted as correct in the absence of CUE.  Where evidence establishes such error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).  Here, the Veteran did not file a timely notice of disagreement (NOD) challenging the September 2008 decision, and new and material evidence was not received within one year of promulgation of the rating decision, nor were new, relevant service records received at any time thereafter.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) and 3.156(c).  Consequently, the September 2008 rating decision became final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.156(b), (c), 3.160(d), 19.52, 20.1103.  

Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of CUE.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105.  CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error."  It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.  Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE.  Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error."  Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993).  In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different.  Id. at 44.

Where evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).  For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision.  Id.

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated"; and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time that decision was rendered.  Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992).  

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision.  See Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233, 235-36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset.  King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014).  The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different.  Id. at 442.  

The benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application in claims of CUE. Andrews v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 177, 186 (2004) (citing Russell, 3 Vet. App. at 313) (it is well established that the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine can never be applicable in assessing a CUE motion because the nature of such a motion is that it involves more than a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated).

As a threshold matter, the Board finds that the arguments advanced by the Veteran allege CUE with the requisite specificity.  See Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003).  The Board will therefore adjudicate the merits of her claim.

Evidence at the time of the September 2008 rating decision included a September 1999 commission examination report that was silent for any signs, symptoms, findings, or diagnoses of hypersomnia.    

In October 2001, the Veteran reported daytime sleepiness and excessive sleep and underwent a sleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea, which was negative for apnea but showed excessive leg movements.  The interpreting clinician noted that her history was consistent with many of the characteristics of narcolepsy, i.e., teenage onset and a history suggestive of cataplexy, stating that if, after managing her leg kicks for approximately one month, her sleepiness did not resolve, performance of a multiple sleep latency test to assess the degree of pathological sleepiness would be beneficial.  She was placed on a trial of Sinemet for the leg movements.

In December 2001, she reported that her sleepiness had been much worse over the past several weeks, stating that she fell asleep when still, approximately 1 to 2 times per day.  The assessment was sleep disorder/narcolepsy.  Sinemet was discontinued and she was placed on Adderall.  

In January 2002, she reported that she had started experiencing sleepiness again despite medication and asked to increase her Adderall dosage.  She was subsequently deployed during which time she was able to sleep approximately 9 hours per night.  Upon her return from deployment, she felt she did not need Adderall anymore and the medication was discontinued.

However, in January 2003, she began to experience an increase in symptoms again and began taking Adderall again.  A September 2003 private treatment note indicates that the Veteran first noticed excessive daytime sleepiness in college when she began to doze off in class no matter how long she had slept.  Currently, she was not taking her medication all the time but was still experiencing daytime sleepiness.  She underwent a sleep study in October 2003 which was negative for sleep disorder breathing.  Her private neurologist, Dr. J.L., diagnosed idiopathic hypersomnia in March 2004, noting that she was responding well to her medication, which included Adderall and Ritalin. 

In July 2004, the Veteran reported that she was still experiencing daytime sleepiness despite taking her medication, and that she occasionally fell asleep while driving, approximately once per week.  She was instructed not to drive until her symptoms improved and was given a profile restricting all driving.  Her symptoms improved and the profile was lifted in August 2004.

The remainder of her service treatment records reflect that she continued to take Adderall and Ritalin to control her hypersomnia symptoms, as also reflected on her August 2007 separation assessment.    

Following separation from active service, as noted above, the Veteran filed an initial claim of entitlement to service connection for hypersomnia in October 2007.

At an April 2008 VA examination, she reported onset of hypersomnia in approximately 2001.  The VA examiner stated that the hypersomnia did not exist prior to active service but did not render a nexus opinion.  

On the basis of the above evidence, a September 2008 rating decision denied service connection for hypersomnia, noting that the service treatment records showed a history of excessive daytime sleepiness that started when she was a teenager.  The narrative concluded that hypersomnia existed prior to service and stated, "[a]lthough you underwent sleep studies while you were on active duty, the treatment and medications you received do not show that your condition was permanently worsened due to your military service."  

The Board finds that there is CUE in the September 2008 rating decision in that it failed to apply the presumption of soundness then extant.  

The relevant laws and regulations at the time the September 2008 rating decision was issued provided that service connection was warranted for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, in the active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110 (2006).  The law also provided that:

every veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.  

38 U.S.C. § 1111 (2006).

The implementing regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b) (2008), at that time provided, as it does currently, as follows:

The veteran will be considered to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable (obvious or manifest) evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior thereto and was not aggravated by such service.  Only such conditions as are recorded in examination reports are to be considered as noted.

In other words, then then-extant version of 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b) provided that the presumption of soundness could only be rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence that a disorder existed prior to service and was not aggravated by service.

The Federal Circuit clarified in Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004) that the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C. § 1111, 1132 is rebutted only if there is both (1) clear and unmistakable evidence that the claimed condition existed prior to service and (2) clear and unmistakable evidence that any preexisting condition was not aggravated by service.

In this case, the Veteran's September 1999 commission examination report is silent as to hypersomnia or any symptoms thereof.  As such, she was entitled to the presumption of soundness, as hypersomnia or other sleep disorder was not noted at the time of enlistment.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b) (2008).  Thus, in order to overcome the presumption of soundness, the RO, in September 2008, needed to find clear and unmistakable evidence that hypersomnia existed prior to service.  Id.  However, the September 2008 rating decision did not make such a finding.  The narrative of the September 2008 rating decision did not mention the negative September 1999 commission examination report, nor did it discuss the April 2008 VA examiner's statement that hypersomnia did not exist prior to active service.  Rather, it appears that the RO, in September 2008, relied on a statement made by the Veteran in the course of seeking treatment during active service that she had noticed excessive daytime sleepiness as a teenager.  Such a statement made by the Veteran, who is not shown to have the professional medical credentials to render a sleep disorder diagnosis, does not constitute clear and unmistakable evidence of a preexisting condition.       

In light of the above, the September 2008 rating decision erred in not applying the statutes and implementing VA regulations pertaining to the presumption of soundness and in not granting service connection for hypersomnia.  Namely, the Veteran did not have hypersomnia or other sleep disorder at the time of enlistment in active service (i.e., hypersomnia or other sleep disorder was not "noted" at enlistment and the presumption of soundness attaches), and the condition first manifested during active service, as documented in her service treatment records, and as determined by the April 2008 VA examiner.  Moreover, as noted in the service treatment records, the condition worsened during active service to the point that she had to begin taking medication to control her symptoms; there is no indication that she required medication for the condition prior to service.  The error in failing to properly apply VA regulations as they were understood in 2008 was undebatable and manifestly changed the outcome of the decision.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that there was CUE in the September 2008 rating decision in that the statutory or regulatory provisions then extant were not correctly applied, the error was undebatable, and the failure to correctly apply those laws and regulations manifestly changed the outcome of the September 2008 rating decision.  For these reasons, the appeal for revision of the September 2008 rating decision is granted to reflect a grant of service connection for hypersomnia.

Regarding the proper effective date, the statutory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award of disability compensation are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110.  Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

In cases involving direct service connection, as is the case here, the effective date will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

Here, entitlement to service connection for hypersomnia arose during active service as it was first diagnosed during active service, as discussed above.  The Veteran filed her initial claim of entitlement to service connection in October 2007.  Therefore, because the Veteran filed her initial claim of entitlement to service connection within one year of service separation on September 29, 2007, the appropriate effective date is the day following separation, or September 30, 2007.  Id.  

For the foregoing reasons, an earlier effective date of September 30, 2007, for the award of service connection for hypersomnia is granted based on CUE in the September 2008 rating decision.
