ORDER

Service connection for a back disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran had a pre-existing back disability, and the pre-existing back disability was aggravated beyond its natural progression during the Veteran's 2016 basic training, which was a period of active duty for training.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a back disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.306. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a Veteran who served in the Army National Guard of Texas beginning August 2015, with active-duty service in the United States Army from January 2018 to June 2018, and periods of active duty for training (ADT) and inactive duty for training (IDT).

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a June 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for a back disability.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for a back disability, asserting that he injured his back during basic training.

Typically, a veteran who is not noted to have a preexisting condition upon entrance into service is presumed to have entered service in sound condition.  38 U.S.C. § 1111.  The presumption of soundness applies to all who served on active duty.  When a veteran's military service is limited to National Guard service or reserve service on active duty for training (ADT) or inactive duty for training (IDT) (or some combination thereof), the presumption operates differently and typically does not apply.  See Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40 (2010).  Indeed, the presumption of soundness only applies for periods of ADT when, prior to that period of ADT, the veteran has been "examined, accepted, and enrolled for service" and where that examination revealed no "defects, infirmities, or disorders."   Smith, 24 Vet. App. at 45-46.  

Here, there are no examinations of record prior to the Veteran's basic training, which qualified as ADT.  Accordingly, the presumption of soundness does not apply. 

The Veteran was on ADT for basic training from March 2016 to November 2016.  The Veteran's service treatment records show treatment for a low back strain in April 2016, followed by physical therapy. A June 2016 service treatment record shows the Veteran continued treatment for the back pain. This record further reveals that the Veteran speculated he injured his back during a ruck march in basic training. He admitted to the clinician that he had chronic back pain that pre-existed active service that stemmed from a 2010 motor vehicle accident. He reported that he was assessed for that back pain in 2014, which predated his basic training. He further stated that he did not disclose this pre-existing condition to his military recruiter or to medical personnel at the Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS). The Board notes that the 2014 assessment of back pain is part of the record and shows he underwent an x-ray. Given the forgoing, the Board finds that the Veteran did have a back condition that pre-existed active service.

Service connection for pre-existing conditions may be granted where there is an increase in such disability during service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(a). The increase in severity of the condition must be permanent. Ward v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 233 (2019); Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292 (1991). Once there is an increase in severity of the pre-existing condition during service, the presumption of aggravation attaches. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b). The burden then shifts to VA to establish with clear and unmistakable evidence that any increase in disability was due to the natural progress of the disease. Id.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in August 2022.  The examiner diagnosed a lumbosacral strain and opined that it was at least as likely as not related to service. The examiner reasoned that service treatment records confirmed treatment for back pain from April 2016 through July 2016.

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in January 2023.  The examiner again diagnosed a lumbosacral strain and stated that he was unable to determine whether it was related to service because the record indicated it may be a pre-existing condition.

A supplemental opinion was provided in May 2023.  The opinion stated that the back condition was less likely than not directly related to service, which the examiner identified as the period from January 2018 to June 2018. The examiner reasoned that the medical records showed a back injury prior to service and that there was evidence of aggravation of the back in 2016 when the Veteran was in basic training.  Given this, the examiner concluded that it was less likely than not a result of his time on active duty from January 2018 to June 2018.

Another supplemental medical opinion was provided in June 2023. The examiner acknowledged the Veteran's back issues during basic training in 2016. However, the examiner explained that there were no subsequent complaints or treatment until 2022, at which point the Veteran was prescribed muscle relaxants. Thus, the examiner concluded that there was no aggravation of the condition during the Veteran's service, the relevant service dates being January 2018 through June 2018.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the May 2023 medical opinion establishes in-service aggravation of the pre-existing back disability. Thus, the presumption of aggravation attaches, and the burden shifts to VA to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that the aggravation was due to the natural progress of the disease. To this end, the evidence does not support such a conclusion. The medical opinions VA has obtained have not shown that the aggravation was due to the natural progress of the disease. While they have not specifically focused on that question, they have touched on aggravation, generally, and the Board will not further remand this claim to develop negative evidence. Accordingly, resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's pre-existing back disability was aggravated by his period of ADT in 2016.

In sum, the Veteran's pre-existing back disability was incurred prior to his 2016 ADT, and it was aggravated beyond its natural progression by that period of ADT.  The presumption of aggravation has not been rebutted, and service connection based upon aggravation of a pre-existing disability is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 1153, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306.
