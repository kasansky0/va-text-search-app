DOCKET NO. 210908-183688
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 8, 2018, for the award of service connection for a psychiatric disability, specifically posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with traumatic brain injury (TBI), is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The appeal for entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability was adjudicated in a June 2018 rating decision in the Legacy appeals system; he filed a May 2019 VA Form 10182, which identified the earlier effective date claim at issue in the present case and which was adjudicated in the June 2018 Legacy rating decision.

2. Because the Veteran filed a May 2019 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), which the Board has accepted as a properly filed NOD with regards to the Legacy system, the docketing of this appeal in the modernized appeals systems-the same issue as currently pending in the Legacy system-represents a procedural defect.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of this appeal for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for a psychiatric disability are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.21, 20.201, 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1982 to August 1985.

In June 2018, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a decision granting service connection for a psychiatric disability and assigning a 70 percent initial evaluation, effective June 8, 2018.  Because this case was promulgated prior to February 19, 2019, the June 2018 rating decision is in the Legacy appeals system.  The Veteran filed a May 2019 VA Form 10182, Board Appeal: NOD (modernized appeals system appellate form), and requested a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge.  The Board docketed this appeal in the modernized appeals system in the Hearing Lane.  In November 2020, however, the Board indicated there was an error in accepting the May 2019 VA Form 10182 form and undocketed that appeal.  

The Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, in February 2021, claiming an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for his psychiatric disability.  The Board reflects that the AOJ's acceptance of this earlier effective date claim was in error, as this "new" claim for an earlier effective date is a freestanding claim that is impermissible.  See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006) (there is no basis for a free-standing earlier effective date claim from matters addressed in a final and binding rating decision).  Therefore, the AOJ's adjudication of the earlier effective date issue in the May 2021 rating decision, which is the subject of the instant VA Form 10182 in this case, is erroneously and not an appealable issue from the Veteran's February 2021 filing.  See Id.

Nevertheless, in reviewing the claims file, the Board is aware that the May 2019 VA Form 10182 was received within one year of the June 2018 Legacy rating decision that awarded service connection.  Moreover, it was the Board's own error in initially accepting the incorrect May 2019 VA Form 10182 as a proper modernized appeals system case that led to delay in rejecting the form and directing the Veteran to file the correct VA Form 21-0958 form instead.  Furthermore, after the Board "undocketed" the May 2019 appeal in November 2020, in October 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) issued a decision in Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).  The Court held a VA Form 10182 filed in connection with a Legacy appeals decision can constitute a properly filed NOD under the Legacy system.  As noted in a companion Legacy appeals decision, the Board is accepting the May 2019 VA Form 10182 as a properly and timely filed NOD in the Legacy system with regards to the June 2018 rating decision.  As such, and because the Supplemental Claim was filed more than one year after the June 2018 rating decision, the Board must dismiss this instant modernized appeals system claim because it constitutes a free-standing earlier effective date under Rudd, as explained above; but more importantly, it must be dismissed because the issue is currently pending and active in the Legacy appeals system, and cannot exist in the modernized appeals system concurrently.  See Hall, supra.  

As indicated, the Board will be addressing this issue in a separate decision in the Legacy appeals system.  See Manlincon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 238 (1999).
