REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a liver condition, including secondary to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with traumatic brain injury (TBI), is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2006 to September 2014.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office.

Unfortunately, the Veteran passed away during the pendency of his appeal.  The Appellant was granted substitution in March 2025.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, and the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for a liver condition, including secondary to PTSD with TBI, is remanded.

The Appellant is of the position that the Veteran had a liver condition due to his active service, including secondary to PTSD with TBI.  

In order to establish service connection, a claimant must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement.  See 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131;38?C.F.R. §?3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi,?381 F.3d 1163, 1167?(Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Secondary service connection may also be established for a non-service-connected disability which is aggravated by a service-connected disability.  In such an instance, there may be compensation for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448.

To establish service connection on a secondary basis, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) medical evidence establishing a nexus between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

A VA examination took place in November 2023.  The clinician indicated that the Veteran had never been diagnosed with a liver disability.  The Board finds this to be inaccurate as the Veteran had elevated liver enzymes and "altered liver function" in August 2022 as a result of alcohol use.  A VA primary care note also listed a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis.  A VA primary care record from June 2018 noted a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis.  A February 2017 VA treatment plan noted that the Veteran had "Liver Disease/Cirrhosis."  The November 2023 examiner opined that the Veteran's liver condition was not related to his active service.  The rationale was that there was no pathology to warrant a diagnosis. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's medical records were reviewed and there was no clinical evidence consistent with a liver condition/diagnosis.  

The Board finds the VA opinion to be inadequate because it is based upon inaccurate facts.  The VA examiner concluded that the Veteran did not have a liver condition when the VA treatment records support a finding that he had a liver condition.  Once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a service connection claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide one that is adequate for purposes of the determination being made.  Barr v. Nicholson,?21 Vet. App. 303, 311?(2007).  The RO should have sought another medical opinion before denying the claim in December 2023 because the November 2023 opinion did not address the August 2022 notation of altered liver function and alcoholic hepatitis or earlier VA treatment for liver abnormalities.  This is a predecisional duty to assist error.  Accordingly, a remand is necessary so that an addendum opinion may be obtained.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the claims file to a qualified clinician so that an addendum opinion may be provided regarding the liver condition claim.  The entire claims file and a copy of this remand must be made available to the clinician for review.

The clinician must determine the following:

a.	whether the Veteran's liver condition was related to service.

b.	whether the Veteran's liver condition was caused by his service-connected PTSD with TBI. 

c.	Whether the Veteran's liver condition was aggravated by his service-connected PTSD with TBI.  

Although an independent review of the file is required, the Board calls the examiner's attention to the Veteran's February 2017, June 2018, and August 2022 VA medical records.

The clinician must provide all findings, along with a complete rationale for his or her opinion(s) in the examination report. If any of the above requested opinions cannot be made without resort to speculation, the clinician must state this and provide a rationale for such conclusion. 

The clinician is advised that an opinion based solely on lack of documentation in service is not sufficient.
