ORDER

Entitlement to basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under the Veterans Rapid Retraining Assistance Program (VRRAP) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran began his educational program prior to the March 11, 2021 enactment of the VRRAP.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under the VRRAP have not been met. 117 Pub. L. 2, 135 Stat. 4, § 8006 (2021).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 1995 to September 1999. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2022 administrative decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) under the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). In such election, the Veteran requested Direct Review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Consequently, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the administrative decision on November 23, 2022. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Entitlement to basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under VRRAP. 

The VRRAP, enacted on March 11, 2021, was a component of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. 117 Pub. L. 2, 135 Stat. 4 (2021). Congress established the program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to provide up to 12 months of retraining assistance to eligible veterans for the pursuit of a covered program of education. 117 Pub. L. 2, 135 Stat. 4, § 8006 (2021). Eligible veterans are a veteran who: (A) as of the date of the receipt by the Department of Veterans Affairs of an application for assistance under this section, is at least 22 years of age but not more than 66 years of age; (B) as of such date, is unemployed by reason of the covered public health emergency, as certified by the veteran; (C) as of such date, is not eligible to receive educational assistance under chapter 30, 31, 32, 33, or 35 of title 38, United States Code, or chapter 1606 of title 10, United States Code; (D) is not enrolled in any Federal or State jobs program; (E) is not in receipt of compensation for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling by reason of unemployability; and (F) will not be in receipt of unemployment compensation.

The facts of this case are simple. A May 2021 Certificate of Eligibility (COE) found the Veteran eligible for VRRAP benefits and noted that he had 12 months of full-time benefits to begin on March 11, 2021, the date VRRAP was signed into law. However, the Veteran's chosen program of Construction Management at Savannah Technical College began on March 9, 2021. After clarifying the dates with the school (see November 23, 2022 Report of Contact) VA denied VRRAP benefits for the Construction Management program, finding that such began before the program was enacted. See November 23, 2022 administrative decision.

The Veteran contends that it is unfair that he was denied benefits for a program that began two days prior to the law's enactment and did not understand why he was ineligible to begin receiving VRRAP benefits for the June 2021 semester instead. 

In this regard, the intent of the VRRAP program was to provide retraining assistance for new programs of education that began on or after March 11, 2021. In the Public Law, regarding amount of assistance, it is stated: (d) AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE.- 

(1) RETRAINING ASSISTANCE.-The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall provide to an eligible veteran pursuing a covered program of education under the retraining assistance program under this section an amount equal to the amount of educational assistance payable under section 3313(c)(1)(A) of title 38, United States Code, for each month the veteran pursues the covered program of education. Such amount shall be payable directly to the educational institution offering the covered program of education pursued by the veteran as follows: 

(A) 50 percent of the total amount payable shall be paid when the eligible veteran begins the program of education. [emphasis added]

(B) 25 percent of the total amount payable shall be paid when the eligible veteran completes the program of education. 

(C) 25 percent of the total amount payable shall be paid when the eligible veteran finds employment in a field related to the program of education.

See https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ2/PLAW-117publ2.pdf.

In reviewing the language of the law, because financial assistance is to be paid when the eligible veteran begins the program of education, it is evident from the use of the word "begins" that the intent was to assist veterans who were being retrained in new areas, not a continuation of programs veterans had begun previous to the VRRAP's enactment, or for subsequent terms of a program that began before the date of enactment. Specifically, the definition of the word begin means "to do the first part of an action; go into the first part of a process." (See Meriam-Webster Dictionary). In this case, the Veteran had already begun his education program. 

Here, unfortunately, there is no mechanism to award benefits for a program that began prior to the enactment of the law which created such benefits. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's frustration and is sympathetic to his arguments; however, the Board does not have the authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104; Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992) (citing Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 426 (1990)).

The law in this case is dispositive. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994). The Veteran is not eligible for VRRAP benefits for an education program entered prior to VRRAP's enactment. The appeal must be denied.
