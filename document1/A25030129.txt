DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) is denied.

Entitlement to a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) survivor's pension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran and the appellant were ceremonially married in September 2021 and there were no children born of their relationship.

2. The Veteran died later in September 2021.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Because the appellant was not married to the Veteran for a year or more prior to his death, the criteria for DIC benefits are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 103, 1102, 1310, 1311, 1541; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(j), 3.50, 3.52, 3.53, 3.204, 3.205.

2. Because the appellant was not married to the Veteran for a year or more prior to his death, the criteria for VA survivor's pension benefits are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 103, 1102, 1304, 1310, 1311, 1541; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(j), 3.50, 3.52, 3.53, 3.204, 3.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Army from May 1972 to May 1975.  He died in September 2021.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2021 administrative decision that denied the appellant's claim for DIC benefits, a survivor's pension, and accrued benefits.  In the April 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket and appealed the denial of DIC and pension benefits.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As the appellant submitted substantive evidence with her appeal to the Board, the Board sent her correspondence in September 2024 instructing her on how to request a change of Board review dockets.  No response was received, and the Board will proceed to adjudicate the appeal on the Direct Review docket.

Entitlement to DIC and survivor's pension benefits is denied

The appellant seeks DIC and survivor's pension benefits based on her relationship to the Veteran.  

For the reasons explained below, the Board finds that the specific criteria for entitlement to this benefit have not been met and her appeal must unfortunately be denied.

At the outset, it is important to note that there is no dispute that the Veteran and the appellant were married at the time of his death in September 2021.  The appellant submitted a marriage certificate confirming that she and the Veteran were married earlier in September 2021.

Marriage to the Veteran at the time of the Veteran's death is a threshold requirement for the payment of DIC survivor's pension benefits to a surviving spouse. However, it is not the only requirement.

The governing regulation regarding the definition of a surviving spouse explains that a surviving spouse is a person who was the spouse of the Veteran at the time of the Veteran's death and who (1) lived with the Veteran continuously since the time of the parties' marriage to the date of the Veteran's death, unless there was a separation which was due to the misconduct of, or procured by, the Veteran without the fault of the spouse, and (2) except as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.55 (pertaining to certain terminations of subsequent marriages), has not remarried and has not held him or herself out to the public as the spouse with whom he or she was then cohabiting.  38 C.F.R. § 3.50(b).

With respect to the specific benefits on appeal regarding DIC benefits, VA imposes an additional requirement regarding the timing of the marriage to the veteran.  In this regard, a surviving spouse may be entitled to DIC if the marriage to the veteran occurred before or during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.54.  Here, there is no question that the Veteran and the appellant were married decades after his separation from active service in May 1975.  For marriages that occurred after the veteran's period of service, DIC is payable in the following circumstances: when the marriage occurred within 15 years after the termination of the period in service in which the injury or disease causing the veteran's death was incurred or aggravated; when the marriage occurred more than one year before the veteran's death; or, for any length of marriage when a child was born of the marriage or born to the couple prior to the marriage.  38 C.F.R. § 3.54(c).

There is no evidence of record that the Veteran and the appellant had a child born of their relationship.  As the ceremonial marriage was many decades after the Veteran's separation from active duty service but more than a year prior to his death, the criteria for entitlement to DIC benefits are not met in the appellant's case.

Concerning the payment of a survivor's pension, VA imposes an additional requirement regarding the timing of the marriage to the Veteran. A surviving spouse may be entitled to pension, compensation, or DIC as an initial matter if the marriage to the Veteran occurred before or during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.54.  As noted above, the Veteran's marriage to the appellant occurred many years after his discharge from military service.

For marriages that occurred after the Veteran's period of service, pension is only payable if the marriage occurred one year or more prior to the Veteran's death, at any time if a child was born of the marriage or prior to the marriage, or prior to various delimiting dates that are not relevant to the appellant's case. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.54(a)(1)-(3).

Again, because the Veteran's marriage to the appellant occurred well under a year prior to his death and there was no child born of their relationship, the criteria for entitlement to a VA survivor's pension are not met.  There is no unambiguity in the facts of record that may be considered by the Board to resolve in the appellant's favor.  The clear weight of the evidence being against the appellant's appeal, the claim for DIC and survivor's pension benefits must be denied.
