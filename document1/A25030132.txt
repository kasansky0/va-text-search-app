DOCKET NO. 210416-156544
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

The claim of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Following the rating decision on appeal, a TDIU was granted effective May 27, 2016.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim of entitlement to a TDIU are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service between April and May 1975.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a March 2021 rating decision by a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which denied entitlement to a TDIU.

In April 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, notice of disagreement, against the decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.  Later that month, the Board granted entitlement to the TDIU.  In a subsequent April 2021 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement effective in May 2016.  As such, the issue on appeal became moot.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  

As the claim on appeal has been granted, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration of this issue.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the issue.  The issue must be dismissed, therefore.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105. 

The Board notes that the RO later, in a January 2022 rating decision, discontinued the TDIU benefits effective in April 2022.  In October 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 against the decision.  This issue is now subject to a separate appeal.
