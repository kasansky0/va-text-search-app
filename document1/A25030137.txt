FINDINGS OF FACT

1. There is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence as to whether tinnitus was noted during service and continued with the same symptomology since service.

2. The competent and probative evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran had a current disability or functional impairment of earning capacity related to sciatica.

3. The competent and probative evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran had a current disability or functional impairment of earning capacity related to a left hip condition.

4. The competent and probative evidence is persuasively against finding that lumbosacral strain resulted in forward flexion 60 degrees or less, a combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine 120 degrees or less; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour.

5. The competent and probative evidence is persuasively against finding that the posttraumatic stress disorder more nearly approximated total social and occupational impairment.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for sciatica are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

3. The criteria for service connection for left hip condition are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

4. The criteria for entitlement to an initial evaluation greater than 10 percent for lumbosacral strain are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.

5. The criteria for entitlement to an initial evaluation greater than 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1999 to March 2002.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from September 2022 and May 2023 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

As a general matter, establishing service connection requires competent evidence of (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Certain chronic diseases, such as tinnitus, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences he can observe.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a).  The VA must give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed Cir. 2009).

Under § 5107(b) and Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001), a claimant is to receive the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate balance" of positive and negative evidence, which Ortiz interpreted as "nearly equal" evidence.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 780-81 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran contends that tinnitus is related to noise exposure during service.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2022.  The Veteran reported that he cannot pinpoint a time when the ringing began, but he suspects it was in service.  The examiner found that tinnitus was less likely than not caused by military noise exposure.  The examiner relied on the fact that there was no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds greater than normal measurement variability, no complaint of tinnitus in service treatment records or at separation, and the Veteran's denial of tinnitus during other examinations.

In light of the foregoing, the competent and probative evidence is approximately balanced as to whether tinnitus was noted in service with post-service continuity of the same symptomatology and the claim is granted.  Because of the inherently subjective nature of tinnitus, it is readily capable of even lay diagnosis and the Veteran, as a layperson, is competent to testify or make statements as to his symptoms.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  As tinnitus is a chronic disease under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), an award of service connection may be established based on continuity of symptomatology, and any doubt on the material issue of nexus is resolved in the Veteran's favor.  See Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-97 (1997); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the claim for service connection for tinnitus is granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Service connection for sciatica 

3. Service connection for left hip condition

The Veteran contends that he has sciatica and left hip condition related to his period of active service.

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection for sciatica and left hip condition is not warranted.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary).  The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), in Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393 (2020), defined a disability under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 as including any condition that results in a functional impairment of earning capacity. The requirement that there be a current disability is satisfied when the disability is shown at the time of the claim or during the pendency of the claim, even though the disability subsequently resolves.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  In the absence of proof of such disability there is no valid claim for service connection under any theory of entitlement.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The Veteran underwent a back conditions examination in December 2022.  The Veteran reported that his lower back hurts all the time, may feel numb intermittently at the lower back, and the pain is felt more on the right side of his middle to lower back when he walks too much.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran does not have radicular pain or any other symptoms due to radiculopathy.  Diagnostic testing revealed normal muscle strength, reflex, and sensory testing, negative straight leg raising test, and no muscle atrophy or ankylosis.  

The evidence of record fails to show a current diagnosis related to sciatica and left hip condition.  VA treatment records do not contain any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of back and left hip problems during the period on appeal.  

The Board has considered the Veteran's contention that he has sciatica and left hip condition.  While the Veteran is competent to report any noticeable symptoms, he is not competent to diagnose sciatica and left hip condition due to the medical complexity of the matters involved.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  In this case, the objective medical evidence of record shows no current disabilities or functional impairment of earning capacity related to sciatica and left hip condition.

As there is not competent and probative evidence of a diagnosis sciatica and left hip condition, the evidence is persuasively against the claims.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for sciatica and left hip condition is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38?U.S.C. §?1155;?38?C.F.R. §§?3.321(a), 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.45, consideration must also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).  In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  The spine has no opposite joint.

1. Entitlement to an initial evaluation greater than 10 percent for lumbosacral strain

The Veteran seeks a higher initial evaluation for lumbosacral strain.

The Veteran's lumbosacral strain has been evaluated as 10 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.  Diagnostic Code 5243 is rated either under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine or under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes, whichever results in the higher evaluation.  Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted when forward flexion of the spine is greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour.  A 20 percent rating is warranted when forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is not greater than 120 degrees; or where there is muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted where forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is 30 degrees or less; or there is favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  Unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine warrants a 50 percent rating, and unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine warrants a 100 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Note (1): Objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are evaluated separately, under an appropriate diagnostic code.

Normal ranges of motion of the thoracolumbar spine are flexion from 0 to 90 degrees; extension from 0 to 30 degrees; lateral flexion bilaterally from 0 to 30 degrees; and rotation bilaterally from 0 to 30 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate V.

The Veteran underwent a back conditions examination in December 2022.  The Veteran reported that his lower back hurts all the time, may feel numb intermittently at the lower back, and the pain is felt more on the right side of his middle to lower back when he walks too much.  She denied flare-ups.  The Veteran described the functional loss as occasional right leg numbness when he drives for long periods and indicated that he has taken off work due to his back because his job is very physical.  Initial active and inactive range of motion were normal with no evidence of pain.  There was no additional loss of function or range of motion after observed repetitive use.  The examiner opined that pain, fatigability, and weakness would significantly limit functional ability after repeated use over time with forward flexion to 85 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 20 degrees, and right and left lateral rotation to 20 degrees.  Upon examination, there was no localized tenderness, guarding, or muscle spasm.  Muscle strength, sensory, and reflex testing were all normal.  There was no muscle atrophy, ankylosis, IVDS, or assistive devices.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran did not have radicular pain or any other symptoms due to radiculopathy.

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that the competent and probative evidence is persuasively against finding that lumbosacral strain resulted in forward flexion 60 degrees or less, a combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine 120 degrees or less; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour.  

The Board finds the December 2022 VA examination to be the most probative evidence and finds no competent evidence contrary to the December 2022 examination findings in the record.  The Board has considered the Veteran's contention that his back disability is more severe than reflected in the 10 percent evaluation.  While the Veteran is competent to describe his back pain and functional limitations, he is not competent to opine as to the severity of his back disability.  The objective evidence of record demonstrates that lumbosacral strain has been manifested by forward flexion greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 with no localized tenderness, muscle spasm, or guarding.  Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and an initial evaluation greater than 10 percent for lumbosacral spine is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.   

2. Entitlement to an initial evaluation greater than 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder

The Veteran seeks a higher evaluation for PTSD.  His PTSD is currently evaluated as 70 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411. 

Psychiatric disabilities are rated based on the General Rating Formula codified in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, which provides disability ratings based on a spectrum of symptoms.  "A veteran may qualify for a given disability rating by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of a similar severity, frequency, and duration." Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 117 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  VA must consider all symptoms of a claimant's condition that affect the level of occupational and social impairment, including, if applicable, those identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).  See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442-43 (2002).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has observed that the listed symptoms are examples of the type and degree of the manifestations of a mental disability required for a given disability rating, and that "the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms" is not required to support a disability rating.  Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442.  It is not sufficient for the Board to simply match the symptoms listed in the rating criteria against those exhibited by a veteran.  Rather, "VA must engage in a holistic analysis" of the severity, frequency, and duration of the signs and symptoms of the veteran's mental disorder, determine the level of occupational and social impairment caused by those signs and symptoms, and assign an evaluation that most nearly approximates that level of occupational and social impairment.  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017).

The symptoms listed in the rating formula are only examples, and evidence of those specific symptoms is not required to show that the Veteran is totally disabled. In rating a mental disability, VA is required to consider all symptoms that affect social and occupational functioning, and not limit consideration to those symptoms listed in the rating formula.  Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).  The primary consideration is whether the manifestations of the service-connected psychiatric disability result in a level of occupational and social impairment, regardless of whether the Veteran demonstrates the specific symptoms listed in the rating formula.

Under the General Rating Formula, a 70 percent rating is assigned when there is evidence of occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessive rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); and an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

A 100 percent rating is assigned where the evidence establishes total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, own name.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

The Board is to consider the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission, and assign an evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.126.

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that an initial evaluation higher than 70 percent is not warranted.

The Veteran was examined in July 2022.  The Veteran met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD and unspecified personality disorder.  The examiner determined that it was not possible to differentiate what symptoms are attributable to each diagnosis.  During the examination, the Veteran reported living with her husband and two children from a previous marriage.  She indicated that she has worked as a mental health aide for the past 2 years.  The examiner found that the symptoms that apply to the Veteran's diagnosis includes depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of mood and motivation, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, and unstable interpersonal relationships.  She opined that the symptoms associated with PTSD resulted in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

VA treatment records from January 2023 show that the Veteran experienced symptoms of anxiety, panic attacks, sleep impairment, and disturbances of mood and motivation.  Suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and hallucinations were not reported.  Symptoms discussed in VA treatment records align with and are not more severe than symptoms reflected in the July 2022 VA examination.

The competent and probative evidence is persuasively against finding that PTSD has resulted in total occupational and social impairment.  The evidence demonstrates that the Veteran has maintained employment for 2 years prior to the examination.  She has experienced some difficulties due to symptoms of PTSD, but the severity, frequency, or duration of the symptoms has not interfered so significantly as to cause total occupational or social impairment.  There is no evidence of any of the symptoms contemplated under the 100 percent rating criteria, such as suicidal ideation, gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, own name.

In sum, the evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran's impairment due to PTSD has more nearly approximated total occupational and social impairment.  The competent and probative evidence of record demonstrates that the symptoms associated with the Veteran's PTSD fall squarely within the criteria contemplated by the assigned 70 percent rating criteria.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and an initial evaluation greater than 10 percent for lumbosacral spine is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.    

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for traumatic brain injury (TBI) to include dizziness and memory loss is remanded.

2. Service connection for left forehead scar (head face or neck) is remanded.

3. Service connection for seizures is remanded.

The Board is not able to make a fully informed decision regarding the issues of service connection for TBI to include dizziness and memory loss, left forehead scar, and seizures.

The Veteran contends that she fell on a concrete table at Fort Gordon and suffered a TBI and the left forehead scar.  She further contends that seizures are secondary to the claimed TBI.  June 15, 2022, VA 21-526EZ; January 22, 2023, VA 21-526EZ.  During a September 30, 2021 primary care visit, the physician noted that the Veteran reported suffering a TBI when she was beat up after her major chemotherapy treatment of choriocarcinoma.

The Veteran underwent a TBI VA examination in March 2023.  The Veteran reported a head injury during service in April 1999.  She recalled waking up with her head being stitched at the right side of her frontal hairline and feeling horrible with a headache and nausea.  She indicated that she did not go back for a follow-up and cannot remember how the stitches came out.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran had a TBI based solely on the Veteran's lay statements on her application, to her primary care physician in September 2021, and during the examination and rendered a positive nexus opinion.  The Board finds that the March 2023 examination to be inadequate as the examiner only provides a conclusory statement without a clear rationale.  A mere conclusion without an underlying rationale is of no probative value.  Miller v. West, 11 Vet. App. 345 (1998).  The failure to obtain an adequate medical examination is a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand is warranted.  

The Veteran underwent a scar examination in October 2022.   The examiner identified a left forehead scar measuring 1.5 x 0.1 centimeters.  The examiner rendered a negative nexus opinion and reasoned that 2002 medical board history notes that the scar is related to a cyst that was removed from the Veteran's left forehead in 1985, prior to military service.  The Board finds that the medical opinion is inadequate as the examiner did not consider the lay statements of the Veteran that the scar was related to the TBI.  Further, the examiner did not address potentially favorable evidence.  Specifically, service treatment records show that a left forehead scar was not noted upon entrance into service and an April 1999 Master Problem List notes a healed laceration (the Veteran asserts that the TBI incident occurred in April 1999).  Accordingly, remand is required to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

As the Veteran contends that seizures are secondary to the claimed TBI, the Board finds the issue of service connection for seizures to be inextricably intertwined with the remanded issue of entitlement to service connection for TBI to include dizziness and memory loss. Thus, remand is required.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (two issues are "inextricably intertwined" when the adjudication of one issue could have "significant impact" on the other issue).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a new examination to determine the nature and etiology of the claimed TBI to include dizziness and memory loss and left forehead scar.  The examiner should review the claims file and address the following:

(a.) The examiner should identify and discuss any TBI, or residuals thereof found on examination and/or identified during the pendency of this claim and opine whether it is at least as likely as not (an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, i.e., nearly equal probability) that the claimed TBI to include dizziness and memory loss was incurred during or is otherwise related to the Veteran's period of active service.

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, i.e., nearly equal probability) that left forehead scar was incurred during or is otherwise related to the Veteran's period of active service.

In rendering the requested opinions, the examiner must consider and address the Veteran's lay statement that she fell on a concrete table at Fort Gordon and suffered a TBI and the left forehead scar in April 1999. 

The examiner must also consider and address potentially favorable evidence that service treatment records show that a left forehead scar was not noted upon entrance into service and an April 1999 Master Problem List notes a healed laceration.

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report in-service events, his symptoms and history. Such reports must be specifically acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinions. Lay statements of record cannot be disregarded solely due to lack of contemporaneous medical evidence.

(Continued on the next page)

?

A thorough rationale, to include reference to relevant evidence of record as appropriate, should be provided for all opinions expressed. If the examiner is unable to provide a requested opinion, a supporting rationale must be given concerning why the opinion cannot be provided.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
