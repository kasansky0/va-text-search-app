ORDER

An increased rating more than 10 percent disabling for a left ankle avascular necrosis, anterior talus, and posterior talofibular ligament tears is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's left ankle avascular necrosis, anterior talus, and posterior talofibular ligament tears is manifested with moderate limitation of motion of the ankle no more than 25 degrees plantar flexion and 10 degrees dorsiflexion.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an increased rating more than 10 percent for left ankle avascular necrosis, anterior talus, and posterior talofibular ligament tears are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1979 to February 1993. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran referenced the September 2023 decision and elected the Board's Direct Review docket.  Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of September 1, 2023-the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after September 1, 2023, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

At the time of filing his 10182 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran was represented by a veterans service organization (VSO). In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-22a for his current attorney representative, however it was outside of the 90 days for a change in representation pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §20.1304 which only allows for a change in representation after the 90 period after a motion that there was good cause for the delay. That said, the Board finds that there was good cause shown, accepts this change in representation, and formally recognized the Veteran's new representative in a February 2025 letter and provided time to submit any argument in support. 38 C.F.R. § 20.5. 

An increased rating more than 10 percent disabling for a left ankle avascular necrosis, anterior talus, and posterior talofibular ligament tears is denied.

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating because his left ankle avascular necrosis, anterior talus, and posterior talofibular ligament tears (left ankle disability) causes daily pain from walking. The record, such as an August 2023 VA examination report, shows that Veteran works as a mail carrier. The Veteran contends that the RO errored by not explaining how it determined functional loss or his restricted range of motion. See Third Party Correspondence received 7/01/2024 at page 1. This appeal began in March 2023, when the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ seeking, among other things, a temporary total rating. From February 27, 2023 (the date the Veteran was admitted for ankle surgery), the Veteran has a temporary total rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 for the left ankle and then a 10 percent rating from July 1, 2023. 

The Veteran's left ankle disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271, for limitation of motion of the ankle. Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for Diagnostic Code 5271.  85 Fed. Reg. 76,453 (Nov. 30, 2020).  Under the new criteria, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle (less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion). A 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion).

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

The Veteran received a VA examination in August 2023, where the examiner diagnosed status post left talonavicular revision fusion with calcaneal autograft, left foot symptomatic implant removal, and open reduction and internal fixation, left navicular fracture in February 2023. The Veteran reported that his left ankle had improved slightly since its onset in service due to surgery. The Veteran had surgery in 2005, and then most recently in 2023. At the August 2023 VA examination, he reported sharp pain, daily swelling, and increased pain when walking and standing for long periods of time. The Veteran also reported taking medication for his left ankle as needed. 

At the August 2023 VA examination, the Veteran denied experiencing flare-ups in his left-ankle. See C&P Exam received 8/29/2023 at pages 4 and 11.  

On active range of motion (ROM) testing, the Veteran's plantar flexion measured 30 degrees and his dorsiflexion measured 10 degrees. The Veteran has pain on both movements. Passive and repetitive use ROM were the same measurements as on active ROM. The August 2023 VA examiner estimated the Veteran's ROM for repetitive use over time would measure 25 degrees for plantar flexion and 10 degrees for dorsiflexion. There was evidence of crepitus on examination. However, the Veteran had no ankylosis of his left ankle. The Veteran reported constant use of an ankle brace. As for functional loss, the Veteran reported losing greater than 5 weeks of work in the last 12 months due to his left ankle. The Veteran reported being out of work for six months due to the left ankle surgery in February 2023. Regarding this last point, as noted above, the Veteran received a temporary100 percent disability rating for his left ankle during that period for the surgery. See Rating Decision received 7/27/2023 at page 1.  

The Board reviewed the Veteran's medical treatment records and they show ankle joint pain listed in his medical history. Prior to his surgery, the Veteran reported ankle pain in 2022 that was a 6, with a 4 being his highest comfort level. See Capri received 3/20/23 at page 105. In August 2022, the Veteran requested a surgery consult due to broken pins in his left ankle. Id. at 107. The Veteran underwent the left ankle surgery in February 2023. 

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating more than 10 percent for the Veteran's left ankle disability because dorsiflexion measured 10 degrees and plantar flexion measured 25 degrees, to include as recorded at the August 2023 VA examination. Thus, these measurements did not meet the criteria corresponding to a higher 20 percent rating.  The Veteran's attorney representative contends that it was unclear how the Veteran's functional loss and restricted range of motion were considered. Indeed, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms, such as pain and that there was functional loss due to pain with prolonged standing and walking and swelling.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements that he experiences daily pain and swelling relieved by rest would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion). For example, the 2023 VA examination report shows that after repeated use over time, based on factors such as pain, weakness, and lack of endurance, it was estimated that the Veteran's plantar flexion motion would decrease by 5 degrees to 25 degrees and the dorsiflexion would not decrease. The Board finds this to be probative evidence showing the impact of the Veteran's restricted range of motion that did not meet the criteria for the next-higher rating. Additionally, the Veteran's current 10 percent rating contemplates and compensates the Veteran's functional loss. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 ("The percentage ratings represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civil occupations."). 

Regarding, the Veteran' use of medication, the Board finds that 38 C.F.R. §4.71a, DC 5271 does not consider the ameliorative effects of medication. In Jones v. Shinseki, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that "the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria." 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). More specifically, "if [a DC] does not specifically contemplate the effects of medication, the Board is required . . . to discount the ameliorative effects of medication." McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) (en banc) (citing Jones, 26 Vet. App. at 63). The record shows that the Veteran stated that he uses medication "as needed" at the August 2023 VA examination. Even without consideration of any ameliorative effects of medication, the Board finds that the record does not support a 20 percent rating since painful motion is already contemplated by the rating criteria, to include 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, and therefore intermittent relief of pain as deduced from his stating that he uses medication "as needed" would not tend to show an increase in his limitation of motion that is equivalent to less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion. 

The Board has considered whether any other Diagnostic Codes related to disabilities of the ankle would provide for a higher disability rating.  However, the evidence does not reflect that the symptoms would warrant a higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  The Veteran does not have ankylosis in his left ankle as shown in his August 2023 VA examination and his medical treatment record, and therefore a rating under DC 5270 for ankylosis of the ankle is not warranted. The Veteran also does not have ankylosis of the subastragalar or tarsal joint, and therefore a rating under DC 5272 is not warranted. See C&P Exam received 8/29/2023 at page 14. The record also reflects that the Veteran did not report and the 2023 examination did not show instability of the ankle. Lastly, the Veteran does not have malunion of the os calcis or astragalus, and therefore a rating under DC 5273 is also not warranted. Id. at page 15.  

Moreover, the Veteran's attorney representative's July 2024 statement contains boilerplate language/contentions that are not specific to the Veteran's appeal. , These vague, unspecific assertions of general due process errors do not amount to procedural argument in this case and need not be addressed further. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (stating that the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board or the Veterans Court to search the record and address procedural arguments when the claimant fails to raise them before the Board).

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's appeal for a rating more than 10 percent for his left ankle disability.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating more than 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
