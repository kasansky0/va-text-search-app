ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) based solely on the Veteran's service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted effective August 26, 2024.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate, effective August 26, 2024, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Effective August 26, 2024, the Veteran's service-connected PTSD, standing alone, prevented him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation, consistent with his vocational and educational background.

2. The Veteran's service-connected PTSD renders him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, and his other service-connected disabilities have a combined rating of more than 60 percent and involve different bodily systems.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Effective August 26, 2024, the criteria for TDIU, based solely on the Veteran's service-connected PTSD, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.1, 4.3, 4.16, 4.19, 4.25, 4.26 (2021).

2. Effective August 26, 2024, the criteria for SMC at the housebound rate have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350, 4.16, 4.25 (2021).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1967 to October 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2025 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2025 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that this claim is "advanced on the docket (AOD)." Accordingly, the Board finds that it is in the Veteran's interest that this matter be adjudicated without further delay. The Board notes that Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024) provides guidance under which the Veteran may choose a docket review option during the latter of one year from the date that the AOJ mails notice of the decision or sixty days from the date the Board receives the notice of disagreement, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2). However, in this case, the delay, until one year from the notice of the rating decision on appeal not best serve this Veteran. 

                                                        TDIU

Laws and Regulations

A TDIU may be assigned when a disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) (2021). If there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, with sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Id.  

Even if a veteran fails to meet the applicable percentage standards enunciated in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), rating boards should refer to the Director, Compensation and Pension Service for extra-schedular consideration all cases where the veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service- connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) (2020).  See also Fanning v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 225 (1993).  

The sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough.  A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment.  The question is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether the Veteran can find employment.  In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training and previous work experience, but not to his age or to any impairment caused by nonservice- connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The Board emphasizes entitlement to an extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b) (1) and a TDIU extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b), although similar, are based on different factors.  See Kellar v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 157 (1994).  An extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1), as discussed above, is based on the fact that the schedular ratings are inadequate to compensate for the average impairment of earning capacity due to the Veteran's disability.  Exceptional or unusual circumstances, such as frequent hospitalization or marked interference with employment, are required.  In contrast, 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) merely requires a determination that a particular veteran is rendered unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of his or her service-connected disabilities.  See VAOPGCPREC 6-96. 

Additionally, the Board cannot assign an extraschedular evaluation in the first instance.  See Floyd v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 88 (1996); Bagwell v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 337, 338-39 (1996); Shipwash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 218, 227 (1995).  Instead, the Board must refer the Veteran's claims to the Under Secretary for Benefits or Director of Compensation and Pension Service for this special consideration when the issue is either raised by the claimant or is reasonably raised by the evidence of record.  See Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 115 (2008); Barringer v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 242 (2008). Only after the Director has determined whether an extraschedular evaluation is warranted does the Board have jurisdiction to decide the merits of the extraschedular aspect of the claims. 

Analysis

The Veteran filed a claim for a TDIU that was received by VA on August 26, 2024.

For the period from August 26, 2024, the Veteran is service connected for PTSD at a 70 percent rating, for peripheral neuropathy of the ulnar nerve of the right upper extremity at a 30 rating, for type II diabetes mellitus at a 20 percent rating, for peripheral neuropathy of the ulnar nerve of the left upper extremity at a 20 rating, for peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerve of the right lower extremity at a 20 rating, for peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerve of the left lower extremity at a 20 rating, for peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve of the right lower extremity at a 20 rating, for peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve of the left lower extremity at a 20 rating, for bilateral hearing loss at a 10 percent rating, for tinnitus at a 10 percent rating, and for hypertension at a noncompensable rating. This results in the combined 100 percent disability rating.

However, a grant of a 100 percent disability again does not always render the issue of TDIU moot. VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether his disabilities establish entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).

Notably, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD, standing alone, prevents him from securing and maintaining substantially gainful employment for the period since August 26, 2024.

Notably a September 2024 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran had depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, near-continuous panic or depression, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, flattened affect, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or worklike setting, suicidal ideation and neglect of personal appearance and hygiene. The examiner also noted that the Veteran's symptoms would make it difficult for anyone to function in an efficient and effective manner in the workplace. The Veteran was likely to leave work or miss work altogether due to his symptoms. He was also likely to have difficulty getting along with others in a work environment. The examiner described the Veteran's level of occupational and social impairment as occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. 

As a result, effective August 26, 2024, the Board finds that the medical and lay evidence establishes that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD standing alone, prevents him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation.

The Board adds that even though the Veteran's PTSD does not cause the "total occupational and social impairment" required for a 100 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 (Diagnostic Code 9411), this does not prevent the Board from finding the Veteran is unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment, the latter being the appropriate, less onerous requirement for establishing TDIU. Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232, 243 (2019).

                                                       SMC

The Board must consider entitlement to SMC if raised by the issue on appeal. Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118 (1991).

SMC at the housebound (s) rate is payable if a Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent and: (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i).

For the purpose of meeting the first criterion (a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent), ratings of 100 percent may be based on any of the following grants of a total rating: on a schedular basis; on an extraschedular basis; on the basis of a TDIU if granted for a single disability; or, on the basis of a temporary total rating.

As discussed above, the Board has found that the Veteran is entitled to TDIU from August 26, 2024, based solely on the effects of his PTSD.

As noted above, a TDIU may satisfy the "rated as total" element of 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s), if the TDIU is awarded for a single disability. Buie, supra. 

Moreover, the Veteran has additional service-connected disabilities ratable at a combined 90 percent from August 26, 2024.

Accordingly, he is entitled to SMC at the housebound rate, effective August 26, 2024.
