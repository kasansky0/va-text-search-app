ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to October 14, 2016 for service connection for hypertension is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for service-connected hypertension is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) from October 14, 2016 is granted.

Entitlement to basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status from October 14, 2016 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively establishes a finding that the Veteran filed the claim of entitlement to service connection for hypertension on October 14, 2016.

2. The competent and credible evidence of record does not persuasively establish a finding that the service-connected hypertension symptoms manifested as diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.

3. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively establishes a finding that the service-connected disabilities rendered the Veteran unable to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment.

4. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively establishes a finding that the service-connected disabilities became permanent and total on October 14, 2016.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to October 14, 2016 for service connection for hypertension have not been met. 8 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3157, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for service-connected hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU from October 14, 2016 have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.18.

4. The criteria for entitlement to basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status from October 14, 2016 have been met. 8 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3157, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1965 to December 1968. This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January and May 2024 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January and May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, respective to their issues. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Finally, the Board notes that with the November 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran submitted a statement in which he waived any duty to assist errors, and his right to change dockets.

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to October 14, 2016 for service connection for hypertension

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). If a claim is filed within one year after separation from service, service connection will be effective as of the day after separation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  

With regard to the date of entitlement, the term date entitlement arose is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, on a facts found basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008). However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the RO receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers. McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

Here, the Veteran filed his initial claim of entitlement to service connection to hypertension on October 14, 2016. The AOJ denied that claim in a February 2017 rating decision, and the Veteran appealed the matter to the Board. In a December 2022 decision, the Board granted service connection in accordance with the PACT Act. In January 2023, the AOJ granted service connection effective August 10, 2022, the date that the PACT Act went into law. The Veteran subsequently appealed the Board decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court). In a June 2023 Joint Motion for Partial Remand, the parties agreed that the Board erred in relying on inadequate VA medical opinions regarding service connection on a direct basis. Following a Board remand, the AOJ granted an earlier effective date of October 14, 2016, the date of the Veteran's claim.

A careful review of the claims file reveals that although the Veteran has had hypertension for many years, there is no evidence that the Veteran submitted any earlier claims for service connection for this condition. As such, the service-connected hypertension is already in receipt of the earliest possible effective date.

The Board finds the Veteran's statements competent as they are capable of lay observation. 38?U.S.C. §?1154(a); Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005) (noting that a lay witness is competent to report to factual matters of which he or she has first-hand knowledge). However, the evidence of record is in conflict with the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995) (noting that the probative value of a witness statement may be affected by inconsistency with other evidence), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

Accordingly, the criteria for the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to October 14, 2016 for service connection for hypertension have not been met, and the appeal is denied.

In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt. In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. In other words, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021). Here, however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not in approximate balance, the doctrine is not for application. Id.

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for service-connected hypertension

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of any disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Although the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings, the Board is to consider the Veteran's medical history in determining the applicability of a higher rating for the entire period in which the appeal has been pending. Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31, 34 (1999).

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous." Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time. Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings). When adjudicating a claim for an increased initial evaluation, the relevant time period is from the date of the claim.  Moore v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 211, 215 (2007), rev'd in irrelevant part, Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369 (2009).  When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the relevant time period for consideration is the time period one year before the claim was filed.  Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509. 

As discussed above, the Veteran filed his claim of entitlement on October 14, 2016. Accordingly, the Board will consider evidence from that date until the May 2024 rating decision on appeal.

The Veteran's disability rating is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. Under Diagnostic Code 7101, a rating of 10 percent is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. A rating of 20 percent is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. A rating of 40 percent is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more. A rating of 60 percent is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria. Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common." See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

The Board may factor the ameliorative effects of blood pressure medication into its analysis of claims for increased ratings for hypertension because Diagnostic Code 7101 expressly mentions the effect of hypertension medications. See McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 276-77 (2016).

The Board also notes that, while Note (1) to Diagnostic Code 7101 requires multiple blood pressure readings to be taken over multiple days to confirm the existence of hypertension. That requirement is not applicable to increased rating claims. Gill v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 386, 391 (2013).

Evidence

The Board notes that claims file is replete with blood pressure readings across VA treatment records, VA examinations, and private treatment records (PTRs). The majority of these readings did not meet the criteria for a ten percent evaluation. There was one reading in May 2015 which showed blood pressure measured at 200/90 post exercise. 

The Veteran underwent a VA heart conditions examination in May 2017 where the blood pressure measured 118/66. Another in December 2017 measured at 132/63. At a heart examination in October 2019, blood pressure measured at 117/75. In January 2021, a heart examination showed blood pressure at 156/84. And in April 2022, a VA heart examination showed blood pressure of 149/74.

The Veteran underwent a VA hypertension examination in January 2021 where he reported that the hypertension was well-controlled with medication. The examiner measured blood pressure at 156/84 three times. They opined that there was no functional impact.

And at a November 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that the hypertension under control due to medication. The examiner measured blood pressure at 115/71, 125/72, and 116/72. They opined that there was no functional impact.

Analysis

Based on the aforementioned, the Board finds that the service-connected hypertension is already appropriately a noncompensable evaluation. The Veteran's medical treatment records are not in significant conflict with the findings of the above VA examinations. A compensable evaluation would require diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. During the appeal period, there is not a single reading which shows diastolic pressure at 110, and only 3 separate readings with systolic pressure at 160 or more, far from the degree that those 3 readings are the predominant range. And even taken the history of the disease, there was only a systolic reading of 200 in 2015, far from the degree that these readings would have been in the predominant range. Indeed, the Veteran does take continuous medication to treat the hypertension, but the criteria for a compensable 10 percent evaluation are not met here.

The criteria for rating hypertension are strictly numbers based, and the numbers here are plainly against the Veteran's claim. The Veteran and his representative have offered no argument or evidence in support of the claim for an increased rating. 

The Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the Veteran's claims file. Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, each piece of evidence of record. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the Board must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence). The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, regarding the Veteran's claim on appeal. The Veteran must not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the appellant).

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's lay statements that the disability is worse than currently evaluated and those statements have been considered. The Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). He is not, however, competent to identify a specific level of disability according to the appropriate diagnostic codes. Such competent evidence concerning the nature and extent of the Veteran's disability have been provided by the medical personnel who have examined the Veteran during the current appeal and who have rendered pertinent opinions in conjunction with the evaluations. The medical findings (as provided in the examination reports and the clinical records) directly address the criteria under which the disability is evaluated. The medical and lay evidence has been assessed by the Board in determining the overall disability rating.

Accordingly, the criteria for the claim of entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for the service-connected hypertension have not been met, and the appeal is denied.

In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt. In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. In other words, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch h, 21 F.4th at 776. Here, however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not in approximate balance, the doctrine is not for application. Id.

3. Entitlement to a TDIU from October 14, 2016

The Veteran has alleged that his service-connected disabilities precluded him from obtaining or maintaining gainful employment. 

A TDIU rating may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. 

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a); see Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018) (combining disabilities as "one disability" to meet the rating threshold of § 4.16(a) requires the use of the combined rating table).

The Court has held that the term "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 has two components. First, there is an economic component which essentially contemplates an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Second, there is a non-economic component dealing with the individual Veteran's ability to "follow and secure" employment. For the second component, attention must be given to: (a) the veteran's history, education, skill and training, (b) the Veteran's physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities (e.g., sedentary, light, medium, heavy or very heavy) required by the occupation at issue, with relevant factors such as lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, reaching, auditory and visual, and (c) whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue, with relevant factors such as memory, concentration, and ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers and demonstrate reliability and productivity. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). As "sedentary" is defined as requiring or marked by much sitting, e.g., a "sedentary desk job," the Board finds that sedentary employment is a job where the worker primarily sits down. See Webster's II New College Dictionary 999 (1999).

A protected work environment is a "lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." See Labruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 11, 27 (2024).

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a Veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training. See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The ultimate question is whether they are capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

Service connection was in effect during the appeal period for the following disabilities: 1) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a 30 percent evaluation prior to July 6, 2023, and a 70 percent evaluation thereafter; 2) renal artery stenosis with a 60 percent evaluation from October 31, 2019; 3) coronary artery disease with a 10 percent evaluation prior to June 20, 2017, a 100 percent evaluation prior to October 1, 2017, a 60 percent evaluation prior to October 31, 2017, a 30 percent evaluation prior to January 2019, and a 60 percent evaluation thereafter; 4) bilateral hearing loss with a 20 percent evaluation; 5) tinnitus with a 10 percent evaluation; and 6) hypertension and erectile dysfunction, each with a noncompensable evaluation. During this period, the combined disability rating was 70 percent prior to June 20, 2017, a 100 percent evaluation prior to October 1, 2017, a 90 percent evaluation prior to October 31, 2017, a 90 percent evaluation prior to July 6, 2023, and a 100 percent evaluation from July 6, 2023. TDIU is also in effect from that date. Accordingly, the schedular criteria for TDIU have been met.

Evidence

The Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) was aircraft maintenance specialist. On the January 2024 TDIU application, the Veteran indicated that he became too disabled to work in 2009, that he last worked full time in 2002, and that the most he ever made in one year was $85,000 in 2001 as a manufacturing supervisor. He noted that he worked pulling trailers on a part time, as needed basis from 2007 to 2009, and that he volunteered at the hospital transporting patients from 2009 to 2010. The Veteran reported that he had a high school education. At a February 2010 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he retired in 2002 as a manufacturing and assembly supervisor due to burnout, and that he had built military airplanes most of his life. At a January 2024 VA examination, he asserted that he stopped working full time due to a work-related back injury. In an October 2020 statement, the Veteran reported that he had been unable to work since 2002 due to the service-connected PTSD, and heart disabilities, and due to his non-service-connected lumbar disorder.

Turning to the service-connected disabilities, as noted above, VA examiners have opined that the hypertension had no functional impact.

Regarding the service-connected heart disability, VA examiners in December 2019, October 2019, and January 2021 all opined that there was functional impact due to fatigue and dyspnea. VA examiners in May 2017, and April 2024 opined that there was no functional impact.

As for the renal stenosis, a VA examiner in November 2019 found that there was no functional impact.

A VA examiner in December 2020 opined that the hearing loss had functional impact, as the Veteran reported that everybody sounded like they were mumbling, and that his girlfriend got mad at him because he always had to ask her to repeat herself. He indicated that he had difficulty hearing the television, and understanding conversations, especially with background noise. In December 2023, a VA examiner opined that functional impact included difficulty hearing soft voices especially with background noise, hearing his wife and daughter, and that he did much better face to face with the speaker to read lips. The examiner noted the Veteran's report of turning the television up to hear and had to use the speaker option on the phone. 

Regarding the tinnitus, the December 2020 examiner opined that there was no functional impact. The December 2023 VA examiner found functional impact included high frequency ringing intermittently several times daily. 

As for the PTSD, a VA examiner in January 2024 opined that that the symptoms manifested as occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood. The Veteran reported that while working delivering trailers, he had many incidents of road rage and had difficulty getting along with others due to a lack of patience. He stated that he often left work in a rage following an argument with coworkers. He endorsed the following symptoms: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impairment of short- and long-term memory, impaired judgment, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances.

The examiner opined that the Veteran would have significant difficulty accepting supervision or receiving instructions without becoming angry, remembering instructions and details of work assignments, functioning around other people, and functioning as a team member, as he felt uncomfortable around others, and his sleep was so disrupted that he was usually fatigued at work, making concentration and focus on work assignments difficult.

And in April 2018, a VA examiner opined that the erectile dysfunction had no functional impact.

Analysis

Based on the aforementioned, the Board finds that a TDIU is warranted from October 14, 2016. This is primarily based on the findings by VA examiners that the service-connected PTSD, coronary artery disease, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus caused functional impact, to include chronic fatigue, and anger management issues. Meanwhile, VA examiners have opined that the service-connected hypertension, renal stenosis, and erectile dysfunction had no functional impact. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran initially retired from his manufacturing career due to the non-service-connected lumbar disability; however, the evidence picture is clear that the Veteran's other service-connected disabilities would have contributed greatly to his inability to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment. There is no evidence of record to show that the Veteran has performed any sort of work since 2010.

The Board acknowledges that VA examiners have at times found that his service-connected disabilities would not severely impact the Veteran's ability to perform sedentary work; however, other evidence of record shows otherwise. Moreover, entitlement to a TDIU is a legal determination, not a medical one. Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Medical examiners may provide evidence regarding functional and occupational impairment, but the Board must decide whether a Veteran may "secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" based on all evidence of record. See Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232, 243 (2019).

Finally, the Board notes that while the Veteran is now in receipt of a TDIU this does not necessarily render the issue on appeal moot. VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether their disabilities establish entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008). This duty to maximize benefits requires VA to assess all of a Veteran's disabilities to determine whether any combination of disabilities establishes entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 294 (finding that SMC benefits are to be accorded when a Veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim). SMC may be warranted if the Veteran has a 100 percent disabling rating for a single disability, and VA finds that TDIU is warranted based solely on disabilities other than the disability that is rated at 100 percent. See Buie, 24 Vet. App. at 242; Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 280.

SMC is payable at a specified rate to a Veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) when a Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, separate, and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems or is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). 

Here, prior to July 6, 2023, TDIU is not granted based solely on one disability, and he does not have any single service-connected disability independently rated at 100 percent, outside the temporary period in 2017 in which SMC is already in effect based on the heart disability. Therefore, he does not meet the criteria for a SMC outside the periods that it is already applied to.

Accordingly, the criteria for the claim of entitlement to a schedular TDIU from October 14, 2016, have been met, and the appeal is granted.

4. Entitlement to basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status from October 14, 2016

Eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance is derived from a Veteran who was discharged under other than dishonorable conditions; and has permanent and total service-connected disabilities; or permanent and total disabilities existed at the time of death; or the Veteran died as a result of service-connected disabilities. Also, eligibility exists for a service member who died in service. Finally, eligibility can be derived from a service member who, as a member of the armed forces on active duty, has been listed for more than 90 days as missing inaction; captured in line of duty by a hostile force; or forcibly detained or interned in line of duty by a foreign government or power. (38 USC Chapter 35, 38 CFR 3.807, 38 CFR 21.3021).

Here, the Veteran is now in receipt with a TDIU from October 14, 2016. Therefore, and earlier effective date is warranted.

The criteria for the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status from October 14, 2016 have been met, and the appeal is granted.
