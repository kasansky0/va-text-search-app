REMANDED

Entitlement to waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) education benefits, to include whether the debt was properly created, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 2018 to October 2021. 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 Demand Letters, issued by the Debt Management Center (DMC), the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) notification on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) education benefits, to include whether the debt was properly created, is remanded.

The Veteran seeks a waiver of the debt and questions the evaluation, which the Board understands to mean the amount of debt owed.

A debtor may dispute the amount or existence of a debt, which is a right that may be exercised separately from a request for waiver or at the same time.  See 38 C.F.R.§1.911(c)(1); see also VAOPGCPREC 6-98.  The propriety and amount of the overpayment at issue are matters that are integral to a waiver determination. See Schaper v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 430, 434 (1991).

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), unless the issue or issues can be granted in full, the Board shall remand the appeal to the agency of original jurisdiction for correction of an error on the part of the agency of original jurisdiction to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction decision on appeal.  The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  The remand must specify the action to be taken by the agency of original jurisdiction.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

In this case, the Debt Management Center (DMC) sent the Veteran a Demand Letter in the amount of $4,722.98 on February 21, 2024 for an overpayment of education benefits.  

On February 23, 2024, a Demand Letter in the amount of $14,944.80 for an overpayment for "housing allowance, CH 33 kicker or supplemental payment," was sent to the Veteran.  On the same day, February 23, 2024, another Demand Letter in the amount of $213.04 for books, supplies, etc. was sent to the Veteran.

However, there are no notification letters prior to these demand letters providing any information regarding the creation of or the calculation of the amounts of these debts, as due process requires.  Thus, it is entirely unclear how the amounts of the debts were calculated, or for which period(s) of time the debts accrued.

The Board finds this absence of notice constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  Moreover, none of the documents associated with the Veteran's award of educational benefits are associated with the file.  Accordingly, a remand is necessary.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a)

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain and associate with the file the documents related to the Veteran's initial award of education benefits.  

2. Obtain and associate with the file all education benefit debt notification letters.

3. Then, prepare an accounting and audit regarding the Veteran's educational benefits, clearly showing what was paid to either the Veteran or the School, and what is owed.  The Veteran must be provided with a copy of the accounting and audit. 

4. If any overpayment is shown, such that a valid debt was created, provide the Veteran with the information to seek waiver of recovery of the overpayment.
