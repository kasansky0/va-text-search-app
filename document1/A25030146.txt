REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from June 1987 to April 1991. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the August 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review Docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

It is also noted that the Veteran initially filed a request for a Higher-Level Review of the March 2024 rating decision. See April 2024, VA Form 20-0996. A Higher-Level Review rating decision was issued in July 2024. Following the July 2024 rating decision, the Veteran filed the August 2024, VA Form 10182, giving rise to the instant appeal of the March 2024 rating decision. The Board recognizes that the modernized review system allows for multiple, successive reviews of an AOJ decision, provided that such requests are filed within one year of the appealed rating decision and are not concurrently pursued. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). Accordingly, the instant appeal is properly before the Board for appellate consideration. 

Service Connection - OSA

The Veteran maintains that he has a disability of OSA which is either directly related to his active service, or secondary to his service-connected tinnitus disability. See November 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ; September 2024, Correspondence.

While the Board regrets the additional delay, a remand is necessary in this case to correct several pre-decisional duty-to-assist errors. 

A review of the record reveals that upon the filing of the Veteran's claim, he submitted a 2008 private sleep study report which confirmed a diagnosis of severe OSA. See November 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ; February 2008, Private Medical Record (associated with the claims file in November 2023). Despite this information and being on notice of private medical treatment, the AOJ did not further assist the Veteran in obtaining any outstanding records to be associated with the claims file. In fact, the AOJ did not provide any notice to the Veteran concerning the filing of his claim at all. The only notification sent to the Veteran was a templated letter recognizing the filing of an intent to file, submitted in November 2023. See November 2023, Intent to File Letter. 

Further review of the record demonstrates that service treatment records (STRs) and military personnel records from the Veteran's active service were previously associated with the claims file during the development of a prior claim. However, those records also reveal that the Veteran's full Army National Guard records have not yet been obtained. While a returned request from April 2021 states that "[a]ll available STRs were previously uploaded," the additional records of periods of active duty for training (ADT) and inactive duty for training (IDT) have yet to be associated with the claims file. See April 2021, VA Form 21-3101, Request for Information. 

It is acknowledged that in order to have eligibility for veterans' benefits based on a period of duty as a member of a state Army National Guard, a National Guardsman must have been ordered into Federal service by the President of the United States, or must have performed "full-time duty" under the provisions of 32 U.S.C. §§ 502, 503, 504, or 505. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(21), (22)(C); see also 32 U.S.C. §§ 315 (providing for detailing of regular members of the U.S. Army and Air Force to duty with the Army or Air National Guard of each State); 502(a)(2) (stating that "each company, battery, squadron, and detachment of the National Guard... shall... participate in training at encampments, maneuvers, outdoor target practice, or other exercises, at least 15 days each year"); 503 (providing for participation in field exercises); 504 (dealing with National Guard Schools and small arms competitions); 505 (dealing with U.S. Army and Air Force schools and field exercises). See also Allen v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 54, 58 (2007). 

In this case, this information is relevant as the Veteran served in the Army National Guard of South Dakota from June 1991 to July 2010. See January 2020, Report of Separation and Recognition of Service. 

The Board also finds that although the STRs associated with the claims file reflect treatment for injuries sustained during active service, they are silent for any complaints or reports of sleep difficulties or a diagnosis of OSA. See e.g., November 5, 1990, STR (treatment for left knee and right shoulder injuries following motor vehicle accident). Furthermore, although the records related to the Veteran's separation from service indicate that a separation medical examination was required, there is no record of such within the claims file, further evincing the existence of additional military records which have yet to be obtained. 

The Board also finds that given the information of record, including the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus disability and the alternatively raised theory of secondary service connection, the AOJ further erred by failing to afford the Veteran with the benefit of a VA examination. The Board finds that prior to the promulgation of the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran established the presence of a current disability and asserted a correlation to an in-service injury, i.e., shift work on a flight line during active service and service-connected tinnitus. The Board finds that this evidence satisfies the low McLendon threshold. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2) (2019); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i) (2020). 

Finally, as a result of the AOJ failing to provide any notice of development to the Veteran for the instant claim, it also erred under 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1), in failing to advise the Veteran that he is "entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim within the purview of part 3 of this chapter before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim." Indeed, 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(1), provides that a claimant is entitled to notice concerning such right. Within the right to fair process, claimants have a right to notice and a right to respond. See Bryant v. Wilkie,33 Vet. App. 43, 46 (2020); Smith v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 332, 337-38 (2020). Due to the failures identified herein, the Veteran was divested of the opportunity to properly develop and present his claim, and to be afforded with the procedural due process assistance required pursuant to the controlling regulations. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103. 

Proper development of the Veteran's claim may have afforded him the opportunity to present written statements, testimony, or other documentation supporting his claim, such as information concerning the onset of his disability, which may have presented with symptoms during active service and continued ever since (with corroborating statements provided); or, which may have begun following the onset of his tinnitus disability and worsened, perhaps beyond the natural progression, due to the service-connected tinnitus disability. 

In sum, the AOJ failed to assist the Veteran in any development of his claim, including obtaining a full medical record as well as a complete record of the Veteran's Army National Guard Service. Second, the AOJ failed to obtain a medical opinion despite the Veteran presenting evidence of a current disability and a properly asserted correlation to an in-service injury. Finally, as a result of failing to provide any development notifications to the Veteran concerning the instant claim, the AOJ failed to satisfy the regulatory duty of advising the Veteran of his right to a pre-decisional hearing before the AOJ. 

Accordingly, a remand is necessary to afford the Veteran a medical examination and perform additional development which should have been conducted prior to a decision being rendered in this case.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Make reasonable efforts to assist the Veteran in obtaining a complete record of private and VA treatment reports, along with Army National Guard records from 1991 to 2010, and associate them with the electronic claims file.

2. Schedule the Veteran for an examination for the claimed OSA disability. The claims file must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner. Any indicated tests and studies must be performed.

Based on the examination of the Veteran and a review of the record, the examiner must provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's diagnosed sleep apnea is proximately due to or the result of his active-service, including, years of shift work on an active flight line, or otherwise etiologically related to service. 

The examiner should also provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent or better probability) that the Veteran's OSA disability was cause by, aggravated by, or would not have occurred but for a service-connected disability, to include consideration of being secondary to tinnitus. 

A complete and detailed rationale must be provided for all opinions expressed. 

3. Provide the Veteran and his representative with notice of the right to a hearing before the RO prior to the issuance of a decision on the instant claim, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b) and (d).
