DOCKET NO. 240505-439250
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on need for aid and attendance (A & A) for the period prior to February 20, 2024 is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

A February 2025 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision granted SMC based on need for A&A for the period prior to February 20, 2024. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to SMC based on need for A&A prior to February 20, 2024 are met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (b)(2), (d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2002 to December 2004. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to SMC based on need for A & A for the period prior to February 20, 2024 is dismissed.

In a February 4, 2025 Board decision, the Board awarded entitlement to SMC based on need for A&A prior to February 20, 2024.  The February 2025 rating decision that implemented the grant assigned an effective date of July 16, 2019. This is a complete grant of the benefit sought.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed, and there remains no allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. 

Here, following the April 2024 rating decision that awarded SMC based on need for A &A effective February 20, 2024, the Veteran submitted a Notice of Disagreement indicating that he wishes to appeal "entitlement to Aid and Attendance before February 20, 2024." Furthermore, in June 2024, the Veteran's representative submitted a brief indicating that the Veteran had submitted an application for SMC based on need for A&A on July 1, 2020, arguing for this as the earlier effective date.  

Therefore, the Board's February 20, 2024 grant of entitlement to a SMC based on need for A&A effective July 16, 2019 is a full grant of the benefit that had been sought on appeal. In fact, it is earlier than the sought date by almost a full year. As such, the current appeal of the issue of entitlement to SMC based on need for A&A prior to February 20, 2024 is rendered moot. In other words, there is no longer a question or controversy remaining for this issue. As the issue of entitlement to a SMC based on A&A prior to February 20, 2024 has been properly adjudicated in a separate appeal stream, and the Veteran was granted the ultimate relief sought on appeal, the Board need not adjudicate this redundant claim. The claim is hereby dismissed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.
