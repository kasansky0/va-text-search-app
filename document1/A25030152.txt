CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for left hip strain have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2.  Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for left knee strain have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on active duty from May 2006 to August 2009.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board by requesting the Direct Review docket; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and reevaluated in the June 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the March 2022 AOJ decision cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

1. Service connection for left hip strain is granted.

2.  Service connection for left knee strain is granted

Service connection may be granted for disability arising from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.

In this case, the diagnoses are a left hip strain and left knee strain, which do not qualify as a "chronic disease" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); therefore, the presumptive service connection provisions based on "chronic" in service symptoms and "continuous" post-service symptoms under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) do not apply.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the Board gives the veteran the benefit of the doubt in resolving the issue.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021) (en banc); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Veteran appeals for service connection for both a left hip strain and a left knee strain.  See June 2024 VA Form 10182.  She contends that hip and knee pain began during service due to low crawling through sand and gravel pits, running, jumping, climbing, road marches in full combat gear with rifles, and from carrying 40 to 50 pound ruck sacks.  See January 2022 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.  The Veteran also reports that she was assigned to work in a supply warehouse, where she worked long hours on her feet, stooping and climbing in and out of warehouse vehicles, lifting heavy boxes, and moving heavy mobility bags.  There was a lot of repetitive movement to include bending, twisting, squatting, lifting and walking, which collectively took a toll on the knees, back, and hips, resulting in chronic pain.

After a review of all the lay and medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the lay and medical evidence is at least in relative equipoise on the question of whether there was onset of symptoms of left hip and left knee disabilities in service and since service separation that were later diagnosed as left hip strain and left knee strain.  The evidence shows in-service injury with subsequent symptoms and a medical nexus opinion.

In January 2022, the Veteran received VA examinations of the hips and knees.  The history included bilateral hip strain and left and right knee strains in 2021, with onset of pain and knee pain beginning in 2006, and that the Veteran had worked on the flight line and supply in a warehouse.  The history included lifting heavy boxes, and moving mobility bags, including all deployment gear and inventory, for 8-12 hours a day, 6-7 days per week.  The Veteran reported taking over-the-counter medications for pain, with minimal to no relief.  The Veteran stated that since 2006 the symptoms have increased in severity and frequency.  She reported use of a TENS unit, heat/cold therapy, rest, physical therapy, chiropractic care, NSAIDS, ASA, Tylenol, topical pain relief, Epsom salt soaks, massage, and gentle stretches.  Her efforts provided little to no improvement.  The Veteran now has difficulty bending, twisting, kneeling, squatting, stooping, walking, standing, sitting, and lying down for prolonged periods of time, and climbing stairs.

After both examinations, after interviewing the Veteran and reviewing the pertinent medical records and up to date literature, the examiner opined that the onset and worsening of the Veteran's hip and knee conditions were more likely than not attributable to the training and job requirements during service.  The examiner cited to a medical journal article that discussed injury-related musculoskeletal conditions common in the military due to overuse from job performance.  See January 2022 VA Examinations for Hips and Knees. 

The evidence weighing in favor of finding in-service onset includes the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements regarding when hip and knee disability symptoms began.  The Veteran is competent to report such symptoms that are capable of lay observation, such as the onset of hip and knee pain, and its persistence since that date.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  The Board finds that the Veteran's assertions of hip and knee injuries during service and hip and knee symptoms during service are consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of service.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  The service treatment records contain a note from a United States Air Force medical professional stating that the Veteran's primary duties were storing property and pulling for distribution, including physical hazards of lifting 30-40lbs, climbing, standing, hazardous noise, and airborne dust.  See January 2007 Service Treatment Record.  Moreover, the VA medical examiner opined that musculoskeletal injuries due to overuse during service are common.  The VA medical examiner opined that the onset of both the Veteran's left hip strain and left knee strain and worsening of the conditions were more likely than not attributable to training and job requirements during service.  See January 2022 VA Examinations for Hips and Knees.  The Board finds the two January 2022 VA positive medical opinions probative as they were based on in-person examinations, medical records, and up-to-date medical literature.      

In Walker, 708 F.3d 1331, the Federal Circuit held that the presumptive theory of continuity of symptomatology can be used only in cases involving those conditions explicitly recognized as chronic under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  While the left hip and left knee disabilities are not chronic diseases listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), as indicated above, the Board has nonetheless found the evidence at least in relative equipoise on the question of whether the Veteran experienced left hip and left knee disability symptoms that began during service and continued since service separation, which were later diagnosed as a left hip strain and left knee strain, thus tending to show direct service incurrence.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d).

As discussed above, the Board is granting the service connection claim based on evidence, including that pertinent to service, which establishes that symptoms of the left hip and left knee disabilities (later diagnosed as a left hip strain and left knee strain) began in service, so were directly "incurred in" service.  The finding that the Veteran has had left hip and left knee disability symptoms since service is supportive of the direct service connection theory of the claim overall because it tends to show that the symptoms that began in service were the basis for the later diagnosed left hip and left knee disabilities.  See Horowitz v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 217, 221-22 (1993) (lay statements are competent on in-service and post-service symptoms - dizziness, loss of balance, hearing trouble, stumble and fall, and tinnitus - that were later diagnosed as Meniere's disease).

For these reasons, and after resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the left hip and left knee disabilities were incurred in active service; thus, the criteria for direct service connection for a left hip strain and left knee strain have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
