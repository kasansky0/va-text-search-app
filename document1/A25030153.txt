FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran submitted a July 2023 notice of disagreement (NOD) (VA Form 10182), in response to a March 2020 statement of the case (SOC), denying service connection for fibromyalgia.  However, the appeal was not timely and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing an appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of service connection for fibromyalgia have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1995 to June 2015.

In a July 2023 NOD, VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Legal Criteria

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, an appeal to the Board must be initiated by the filing of a NOD in the form prescribed by the Secretary.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.201.  The NOD must be in writing and identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2)(A); see also 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a) a NOD must identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees. Except as provided in the case of simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed NOD with a decision by the RO within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A); see also 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).  The Board will construe such arguments in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal, but the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

The Board notes that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) recently held that although the one-year appeal period in section 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b) is mandatory, it does not place a jurisdictional limitation on the Board.  See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (addressing Legacy NOD timing).  Rather, it is an important and mandatory claim-processing rule, but it does not deprive the Board of the authority to consider the merits of an appeal simply because an NOD is received late.  The Board may apply the exception under 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b), which applies to NODs and permits extensions to VA's internal deadlines for good cause, which states that a request for an extension of a time limit must be submitted concurrent with or after the untimely submission is made, and that good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 

Service connection fibromyalgia.

Analysis

In the July 2023 NOD, the Veteran listed the claim of service connection for fibromyalgia.  It was most recently denied in the March 2020 SOC, which was listed on the NOD.  However, the Board finds the appeal must be dismissed as the Veteran did not file a timely appeal for this claim and the NOD was not timely as to an eligible decision for the claim.

VA received a "Fully Developed Claim" form (Form 21-526EZ), which included claims for service connection fibromyalgia in October 2016 under the Legacy appeal stream.  A rating decision was issued in May 2017 that denied service connection for this claim.  In May 2018, the Veteran filed another Form 21-526EZ.  An August 2018 rating decision denied the Veteran's fibromyalgia claim for nonreceipt of NME.  In May 2019, the filed a NOD.  In March 2020, the RO issued a SOC denying the claim and notifying the Veteran that if the Veteran did not agree with the decision, she had one year from the date of the SOC to select a review option in order to protect the initial filing date for effective date purposes.  It then informed the Veteran that if she wanted to appeal the decision to the Board of Veterans Appeals, he needed to submit a "VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)."  (Italics in original.)  The notification letter included the website from where to obtain the form.  The Veteran subsequently filed a VA Form 10182 NOD in July 2023, opting in to the AMA.  While the Veteran was sent a July 2023 BVA docketing letter confirming receipt and placement of the appeal on the Direct Review docket, VA sent a subsequent letter informing the Veteran that a procedural error was found after a detailed review, and that this claim was untimely appealed in the July 2023 NOD from the denial of this claim in the March 2020 SOC.

The Board finds the appeal must be dismissed, as the July 2023 NOD is untimely as to the issue of service connection for fibromyalgia.  In this regard, a claimant must file a properly completed NOD with a decision by the RO within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).  Here, the most recent rating decision denying service connection for fibromyalgia was issued on March 20, 2020.  The Veteran had one year from that date to file an NOD pertaining to this claim.   As VA received an NOD concerning this claim July 2023, she did not timely appeal the March 2020 SOC within the one year time limitation.  In addition, while some of the time period to appeal occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, unlike Ferko, no request for an extension of a time limit was ever submitted.  Also, there is no documentation in the claims file suggesting that an extension for the period of filing an NOD was made by the Veteran.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c).  Thus, the Board need not address the question of whether good cause was shown.  As a result, an appeal of this issue is not properly before the Board in the AMA system, and the appeal is dismissed.  

In summary, the Board finds that the Veteran's July 2023 appeal is not a proper appeal of the issue of service connection for fibromyalgia under AMA and was improperly docketed.  Also, there is an absence of any evidence that good cause to extend the time to appeal was submitted.  As there are no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration, there is no matter in controversy properly before the Board.  Therefore, the appeal must be dismissed.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.
