REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1990 to April 1991.

A September 2022 rating decision issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for an anxiety disorder, a lumbar spine disability, and left and right lower extremity radiculopathy.  In October 2022, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) requesting review of the September 2022 rating decision.  In December 2022, the higher-level reviewer determined that additional development was necessary and moved the appeal to the supplemental claim lane.  Thereafter, in a February 2024 supplemental decision, the AOJ continued its prior denial of the claims based on finding that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  Therefore, the Board must determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based only on the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal. 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

New and Relevant Evidence

The Veteran generally contends that he submitted new and relevant evidence to warrant readjudication of the claims for service connection for an anxiety disorder, a lumbar spine disability, and left and right lower extremity radiculopathy.  

The AOJ previously denied the Veteran's claims for service connection in the September 2022 rating decision because the evidence did not show that the claimed disabilities were incurred in or otherwise related to military service.

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).  In this regard, "new evidence" is existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers, while "relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove the matter at issue.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).

The question in this case is whether the Veteran submitted evidence after the September 2022 rating decision (until the February 2024 rating decision on appeal) and, if so, whether that evidence is new and relevant to his service connection claims for an anxiety disorder, a lumbar spine disability, and left and right lower extremity radiculopathy.  

Upon review of the record, the Board notes that the AOJ made an attempt to retrieve potentially-outstanding military personnel records; however, these records were deemed to not exist.  In October 2022, the Veteran's attorney submitted a brief; however, the brief only identified evidence and argument that were already of record prior to the September 2022 rating decision.  The only other records that were associated with the claims file during the relevant time period are VA treatment records, which do not show any treatment for the claimed conditions or suggest an etiology for them.   

While the VA treatment records constitute new evidence because it was not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers, the Board does not find the new evidence to be relevant because it does not prove or disprove any of the matters at issue.  Therefore, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has not been submitted and readjudication of the service connection claims for an anxiety disorder, a lumbar spine disability, and left and right lower extremity radiculopathy is not warranted.
