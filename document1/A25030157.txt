REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2017 to August 2023.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO).  On the Decision Review Request Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) VA Form 10182, received in February 2024, the Veteran requested a Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  In this regard, the Board notes that under the direct review option, no additional evidence received after the appealed rating decision is to be considered; rather, review is limited to the evidence on record at the time of the decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

The Veteran asserts that he developed the claims on appeal as a result of his active duty service.  See August 2023 Claim.  With regard to his claims for lumbar spine and joint pain, he asserts developing these disabilities due to physical training, annual rucks, working under vehicles, and lifting, bending, and straining.  With regard to eczema, he asserts developing the disability due to sleeping in the woods and being exposed to dry inadequate conditions.  He did not provide lay statements regarding his cyst claim.  Regarding his claim for diarrhea, he asserts eating uncooked and/or not properly sanitized food during service.  Regarding fatigue, he asserts being forced to stay up for long hours at night and early morning.  Regarding high blood pressure, he asserts that his service resulted in stress.  Lastly, he asserts that his tinnitus claim is related to shooting loud guns and operating and working on loud machinery during service which caused loud uncomfortable ringing in his ears.  He did not provide any specificity as to when the claimed disabilities began, he did not report receiving any medical treatment during or after his active duty service, and he did not provide any statement that he currently experienced symptoms related to these claims.

The service treatment records (STRs) do not reveal any complaints or treatment related to these claims on appeal.  They show that the Veteran noted a general report of muscle, joint, or low back pain without any context during a February 2021 periodic health assessment.  However, this assessment also shows that he denied having muscle, joint, or low back pain.  He additionally denied having back pain on several occasions between November 2018 and November 2022.  There are no reports or records documenting treatment related to general joint pain other than those affecting his feet and knee, and those claims are addressed in the Remand section below.

With regard to his claims for cyst and eczema, the STRs only document treatment related to shaving bumps, acne, and pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), and those claims are also addressed in the Remand section below.  The STRs further show that the Veteran denied having diarrhea in December 2018, April 2019, and December 2019, and fatigue in April 2019.  The STRs do not document treatment related to high blood pressure.  Instead, during a November 2018 periodic health assessment, his blood pressure was 116/78, and he denied having high blood pressure.  He additionally denied having symptoms related to tinnitus during his November 2018 periodic health assessment, and he denied being bother by noises in his ear in January 2020 and April 2022.

The Veteran was scheduled for a series of VA examinations in October and November 2023, including examinations related to his claims for cyst and tinnitus, and he was notified of these examinations in October 2023 letters.  He did not report for his scheduled VA examinations.  Additionally, at the time of the November 2023 rating decision, neither the Veteran nor his representative provided VA with any cause as to why he missed those examinations.  

The Board does recognize that in his February 2024 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran asserted that he had been unable to attend these examinations because he was homeless.  However, a review of his September 2023 claim shows that he specifically denied being homeless at that time.  Additionally, the record does not indicate that the notice letters sent to the Veteran prior to the rating decision on appeal were returned as undeliverable.  Accordingly, the Veteran has provided conflicting statements as to why he missed his VA examinations, and the Board is unable to credit his reporting in this instance.

The duty to assist is not a one-way street.  See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).  Under VA regulations, it is incumbent upon the Veteran to submit to a VA examination if he is applying for VA benefits.  See Dusek v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 519 (1992).  As he did not attend his scheduled VA examinations without a showing of good cause, the Board is to adjudicate the claims based on the evidence of record.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for lumbar spine disability, joint pain, cyst, eczema, diarrhea, fatigue, high blood pressure, and tinnitus are not warranted.  In this regard, throughout the appeal period the Veteran did not receive treatment or diagnoses related to these claims on appeal.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran had not been scheduled for a VA examination with respect to his service connection claims for lumbar spine disability, joint pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and high blood pressure, but finds no such examination was required because the evidence does not indicate that he had a current disability related to those claims and the Board finds no competent evidence that these claims may be related to his service.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).  Therefore, the Board finds that VA medical opinions were not necessary to decide these claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i)(C).

Thus, the Board finds that the competent and probative evidence of record is persuasively against a finding that the first and third Shedden requirements have been met, and the evidence of record is persuasively against the service connection claims for lumbar spine disability, joint pain, cyst, eczema, diarrhea, fatigue, high blood pressure, and tinnitus.  The claims are denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The STRs document that the Veteran was treated for and/or reported symptoms related to, the remaining claims on appeal.  The Veteran additionally filed his service connection claims three months after his separation from service.

With regard to his claim for acne and scars, the STRs show that he was assessed with PFB (January 2018) and acne (December 2019, October 2020, and May 2023), as well as mild acne related scarring (December 2019).  He was treated for acute pharyngitis in December 2018.  A November 2017 STR noted complaints of bilateral foot pain, and the clinician noted that his symptoms were consistent with plantar fasciitis/pes planus.  He was also treated for right leg iliotibial band syndrome in April 2019.  A February 2021 periodic health assessment shows he denied having a current headache, but he did report having experienced recurring headaches/migraines that impacted his performance during a periodic health assessment.  Thereafter, an April 2022 STR noted symptoms including headaches which had been present the past four days.  He additionally reported having received mental health treatment during the February 2021 health assessment.

While the record shows that the Veteran did not report for his scheduled VA examinations, in consideration that his STRs do document treatment and/or reported symptoms related to these claims, and in further consideration that he filed his service connection claims within one year following his separation from service, VA examination reports should have been obtained based on a review of the claims file to determine whether his STRs evidenced chronic disabilities.

Regarding his service connection claim for alcohol abuse, as this claim pertains to a mental health disability, efforts should have been made to obtain clarification from the Veteran when and where he received his mental health treatment during service as they do not contain any such treatment record(s).

Accordingly, a duty to assist existed to obtain VA examination reports based on a review of the claims file, and to obtain clarification as to any mental health treatment, and a remand is necessary to cure the duty to assist errors.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Identify and obtain any service era mental health treatment records.

2. Obtain examinations to determine the nature and etiology of any diagnosed acne, scars, acute pharyngitis, foot pain, headaches, and iliotibial band syndrome.  

Based on a review of the claims file, the examiner should provide opinions as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran has diagnoses for acne, scars, acute pharyngitis, foot pain, headaches, and iliotibial band syndrome, that are etiologically related to his period of service.

Reasons should be provided for any opinion rendered.  If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resort to speculation, an explanation as to why this is so should be provided and any additional evidence that would be necessary before an opinion could be rendered should be identified.
