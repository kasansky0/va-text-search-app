DOCKET NO. 240717-457647
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

An effective date of December 16, 2021, but not earlier, for the grant of a 10 percent rating for chronic bilateral maxillary sinusitis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record demonstrates the onset of worsening sinus symptoms during the one-year look back period prior to the granted effective date for the 10 percent disability rating.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of December 16, 2021, for the grant of a 10 percent disability rating for chronic bilateral maxillary sinusitis have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114, 3.400, 4.130

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active-duty service from November 1989 to March 1998.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Dates

The law regarding effective dates states that, unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a). This statutory provision is implemented by a VA regulation, which provides that the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

There is an exception in that the effective date of an increase in disability compensation is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if the claim is received within one year from such date. Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim. When medical records indicate an increase in a disability, receipt of such medical records may be used to establish effective date(s) for retroactive benefits based on facts-found of an increase in a disability only if a complete claim or intent to file a claim for an increase is received within one year of the date of the report of examination, hospitalization, or medical treatment. The provisions of this paragraph apply only when such reports relate to examination or treatment of a disability for which service-connection has previously been established. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

1. An effective date of December 16, 2021, but not earlier, for the grant of a 10 percent rating for chronic bilateral maxillary sinusitis 

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of a 10 percent rating for chronic bilateral maxillary sinusitis. He argues that the one year look back period should be applied to the assignment of his effective date based upon the worsening of his symptoms in the year prior. After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that earlier effective date of December 16, 2021, should be assigned.

The Veteran's sinusitis is evaluated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 6513 which contemplates sinusitis under the General Rating Formula for Sinusitis. His increased 10 percent rating was assigned due to the occurrence of three to six (in his specific case five) episodes of non-incapacitating sinusitis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6513. In a January 2023 examination for his sinusitis the Veteran was found to have experienced five non-incapacitating episodes of sinusitis in the previous 12 months. This was the basis used by the AOJ to grant his 10 percent rating. 

Thus, the evidence of record shows the Veteran demonstrated the onset of worsening sinusitis symptoms during the one-year look back period (one year prior to his submitted claim). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400 (o)(2), 4.130. Therefore, an earlier effective date of one year prior to the Veteran's claim for a higher rating for his sinusitis should be granted. This establishes an effective date of December 16, 2021, for the grant of a 10 percent disability rating for his chronic bilateral maxillary sinusitis. Given the Veteran's statement on his VA Form 10182, the Board considers this decision to be a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal.
