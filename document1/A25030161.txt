ORDER

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.  

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence does not show that the Veteran has a hearing loss disability in either ear for VA purposes.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hearing loss in either ear have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

 The Veteran had active service from October 2018 to October 2022. 

A March 2024 rating decision denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  In June 2024, the Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a Notice of Disagreement (Form 10182) and selecting the Direct Docket, a process which allows the Board to review the evidence up to the March 2024 rating decision.  Of note, there is additional evidence (to include VA treatment records, etc.) associated with the file after the March 2024 rating decision which the Board is not legally allowed to review in conjunction with the adjudication of this appeal. If the Veteran would like the VA to review these additional documents, he may file a supplemental claim (the instructions on filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision).

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service (nexus). Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran's exposure to military noise trauma was conceded by the March 2024 rating decision.  However, service connection for hearing loss requires not just military noise exposure, but also a showing that such exposure resulted in a hearing loss disability for VA purposes.

For VA purposes, hearing loss will be considered to be a disability when (1) the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or (2) the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or (3) when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

A VA examination in November 2023 showed the following results:

HERTZ	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	MD CNC

R. Ear	10	5	10	25	15	 96%

L. Ear	15	10	15	35	20	 96%

The audiometric testing failed to show that the Veteran has a hearing loss disability in either ear as defined by VA regulations. That is, none of the auditory threshold in either ear was 40 decibels or greater, at least three of the frequencies (500, 100, 200, 300, or 4000 Hertz) were not 26 decibels or greater in either ear, and speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test were 94 percent or better in both ears. 

This is not to say that the Veteran does not have hearing problems.  A VA audiology note in September 2023 documented the Veteran's complaints of auditory and communication difficulties with normal or near normal audiologic findings.  However, VA regulations are very specific about when hearing problems are considered to constitute a hearing disability.  Here, they have simply not reached that threshold.

In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  Here, the Veteran has not been shown to have a hearing loss disability in either ear as defined in VA regulations.  Accordingly, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

As discussed above, the Board is only allowed to review the evidence up to the March 2024 rating decision in conjunction with the adjudication of this appeal. If the Veteran has additional evidence to support his claim, to include evidence showing that he has a hearing loss disability for VA purpose as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, he may file a supplemental claim.
