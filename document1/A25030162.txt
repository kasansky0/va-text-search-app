REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from June 1978 to June 1998.

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension

2. Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches 

3. Entitlement to service connection bilateral pes planus 

4. Entitlement to service connection for a thoracolumbar spine disability

The Veteran's claims for service connection were originally denied in October 2019 (bilateral peas planus) and November 2020 (hypertension, migraine headaches, and thoracolumbar spine disability) rating decisions. The Veteran did not submit a VA Form 10182 (notice of disagreement), a higher-level review request, or a supplemental claim within one year of the rating decisions. The rating decisions became final. 

In September 2021, the Veteran completed and submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review seeking review of the October 2019 rating decision denying service connection for bilateral pes planus.  In October 2021, the VA sent correspondence to the Veteran informing her that the claim for bilateral service connection for bilateral pes planus could not be the subject of a higher-level review, and that she would need to submit a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.

In June 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, seeking service connection for bilateral hearing loss, a thoracolumbar spine disability, hypertension, migraine headaches, and bilateral pes planus. 

In October 2022, the VA sent correspondence informing the Veteran she would need to file her claims for service connection on the proper form, to include VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. 

In October 2022, the Veteran submitted an untimely Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) for the October 2019 and November 2020 rating decisions. 

In January 2025, VA sent correspondence to the Veteran informing her that the Board was going to consider whether her October 2022 Notice of Disagreement was valid as to the issues of entitlement for service connection for migraines, a bilateral foot disability, hypertension, and a lumbar spine disability.  The letter explained that the appeal was defective because it was not timely with respect to the October 2019 and November 2020 rating decisions because it must be filed within one year from the rating decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202, 20.203. The letter explained that VA had not received a request for an extension of the period for filing a VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203. She was informed that her appeals may be dismissed.  She was informed that she could submit written argument and evidence as to the jurisdictional question as well as request a hearing before the Board on this issue.  She was informed that she needed to respond within 60 days of the letter, and she did not.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104.  

The Veteran's October 2022 VA Form 10182 was not filed within one year of either the October 2019 or November 2020 rating decisions and she has not requested an extension of the period for filing a VA Form 10182.  Here, because there is no valid notice of disagreement, there is no error of fact or law being appealed. The Board therefore must dismiss the appeal.
