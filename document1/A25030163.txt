REMANDED

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for readjudicating the claim to establish service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 2005 to April 2009.  

This matter comes before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The June 2024 rating decision constitutes an initial decision thus the modernized review system applies, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  ? 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.? Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the notice of the June 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.? 38?U.S.C. §?20.301.?? 

The Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of the Veteran's right to change Board dockets under Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).  Moreover, as the Board is granting in part, and remanding for further development, the Board will proceed to adjudicate this matter.  

1. New and relevant evidence has been received with respect to the previously denied claim to establish service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, and thus, readjudication of the claim is warranted.  

Upon a review of the record, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has been presented after the prior denial of the Veteran's claim for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 U.S.C. § 501(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d).  "Relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue.  38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5103, 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  

Here, the RO initially denied this claim in a March 2023 rating decision.  The RO found there were favorable findings that the Veteran's claimed primary disability of anxiety disorder and somatic symptom disorder is service-connected, and that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability of OSA confirmed by the December 2022 VA examiner.  The December 2022 examiner opined that the Veteran's OSA is less likely than not related to the Veteran's anxiety disorder and somatic symptoms disorder.  

The Veteran filed her VA form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim application in February 2024, within a year of the March 2023 rating decision.  The Veteran provided medical literature discussing the effects of antidepressants on sleep.  The Veteran urges that her OSA has been aggravated by the medication she takes for her service-connected anxiety disorder and somatic symptom disorder.  The Board finds that the Veteran has submitted new and relevant evidence.  

The Board finds that the newly submitted evidence tends to prove or disprove the Veteran's claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1).  The Board finds that new and relevant evidence has been presented and readjudication is warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is remanded.  

The Veteran urges that her current obstructive sleep apnea has been aggravated beyond its natural progression due to her medication for her service-connected anxiety disorder and somatic symptom disorder.  A claimant has the right to one review on appeal to the Board.  38?U.S.C. §?7104 (a).  After finding that new and relevant evidence has been received, the Board must return the matters to the RO for consideration on the merits unless the claimant waives consideration by the RO, or the Board determines that the claimant would not be prejudiced by a decision on the merits.  See Hickson v. Shinseki, 23?Vet. App.?394 (2010).  The Board finds that an adjudication on the current record would be prejudicial to the Veteran.  Thus, a remand is required for initial RO consideration as service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Readjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea on the merits.
