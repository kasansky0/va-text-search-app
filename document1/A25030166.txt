DOCKET NO. 240610-446267
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the evaluation of the Veteran's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and residuals of traumatic brain injury (TBI) was properly addressed in a September 2024 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision issued under the Legacy review system, and the current appeal for this same matter under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) review system is dismissed.  

FINDINGS OF FACT  

1. The Veteran timely perfected his appeal of an October 2015 decision, issued under the Legacy review system, involving the matters of PTSD and TBI.

2. During the pendency of the Legacy appeal, a partial grant increasing the evaluation of PTSD and TBI was awarded by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in a December 2023 decision.  The December 2023 decision does not constitute an initial decision to be eligible for review under the AMA system.  

3. A June 2024 Notice of Disagreement, from which the current appeal stems, was not a timely opt-in to the AMA review system from a March 2024 supplemental statement of the case concerning the matter of an increased rating for PTSD and TBI.

4. The appeal concerning the evaluation of the Veteran's PTSD and TBI, was properly addressed in a September 2024 Board decision issued under the Legacy review system.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal concerning the evaluation of the Veteran's PTSD and residuals of TBI was properly addressed in a September 2024 Board decision issued under the Legacy review system, and the current appeal for this same matter under the AMA review system must be dismissed as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2, 19.52, 3.2400, 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1968 to July 1970.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Board finds that a discussion of the relevant procedural history is necessary as it pertains to the current appeal based on the Notice of Disagreement received on June 10, 2024.  

As it pertains to the current appeal, the Veteran timely perfected his appeal of an October 2015 decision, issued under the Legacy review system, to the extent that it (1) denied a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for PTSD, and (2) denied service connection for TBI.  See 38 C.F.R. § 19.22.  In an October 2019 decision, the Board granted service connection for TBI, and remanded the appeal for an increased rating for PTSD.  

The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental statement of the case in September 2020, which combined the evaluation of PTSD and TBI, and granted an increased rating of 40 percent.  Following the issuance of the September 2020 supplemental statement of the case, the appeal for a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for PTSD and TBI was returned to the Board under the Legacy review system.  

In May 2023, the Board remanded the appeal for a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for PTSD and TBI for additional development.  In a December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ awarded a partial grant of the appeal, which increased the evaluation of the Veteran's PTSD and TBI to 50 percent prior to July 24, 2023, and 100 percent thereafter.  To the extent that the December 2023 rating decision denied a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD and TBI prior to July 24, 2023, the AOJ issued a supplemental statement of the case under the Legacy review system in March 2024.

In June 2024, the Veteran submitted a Notice of Disagreement under the AMA system seeking Board review of the December 2023 decision that denied a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for the Veteran's PTSD and TBI prior to July 24, 2023.  See June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  As an initial matter, the December 2023 decision is only a partial grant of the appeal under the Legacy review system for an increased rating for PTSD and TBI, and does not constitute an initial decision to be eligible for review under the AMA system.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400; see also Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  Additionally, the June 2024 Notice of Disagreement was not a timely opt-in to the AMA review system from the March 2024 supplemental statement of the case.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 3.2400.

Following the issuance of the March 2024 supplemental statement of the case, the appeal for an increased rating for PTSD and TBI was returned to the Board under the Legacy review system.  In a September 2024 decision, properly issued under the Legacy review system, the Board addressed the matter concerning the evaluation of the Veteran's PTSD and TBI.

In light of the procedural history discussed above, the December 2023 decision, from which the current AMA appeal stems, was not eligible for review under the AMA system.  Additionally, the June 2024 Notice of Disagreement was not a timely opt-in to the AMA review system from the March 2024 supplemental statement of the case.  Finally, the appeal concerning the evaluation of the Veteran's PTSD and TBI was properly addressed in a September 2024 Board decision issued under the Legacy review system.  Accordingly, the current appeal for this same matter pertaining to the evaluation of the Veteran's PTSD and TBI under the AMA review system must be dismissed as a matter of law.
