ORDER

Service connection for right knee disability is denied.

Service connection for back disability is denied.

An initial 10 percent disability rating for bilateral pes planus is granted; subject to the laws and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for right hand disability, to include right hand pain, is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for left hand disability is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record does not reflect a diagnosis of right knee disability during the period on appeal.

2. The evidence of record does not reflect a diagnosis of back disability during the period on appeal.

3. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected bilateral pes planus results in bilateral foot pain.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for right knee disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for back disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

3. The criteria for an initial 10 percent disability rating for bilateral pes planus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1975 to March 1981.  The rating decisions on appeal were issued in May 2023 (right knee, pes planus) and July 2023 (back and right and left hands) and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2023 and July 2023 rating decisions.  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, considering the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 and July 2023 initial rating decisions.  In his July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 and July 2023 rating decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right knee disability

2. Entitlement to service connection for back disability

The Veteran seeks service connection for right knee and back disabilities he asserts are related to his active military service.

Upon review of the relevant evidence, the Board determines that service connection for right knee and back disabilities is not warranted.  The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) reflect treatment for right knee pain in July and August of 1984, after the Veteran fell down while running on the beach.  No further treatment or complaints are noted as to the right knee, to include the Veteran's separation examination.  His STRs also reflect no reports of any back symptoms or a diagnosed back disorder.  Post-service VA treatment records, as well as the March 2023 VA knee examination, are silent for diagnoses of and treatment for right knee and back disorders.  Notably, the Veteran denied right knee symptoms, to include pain, during the March 2023 VA examination, and he denied any back issues, to include pain, throughout post-service VA treatment records.  As such, the Veteran has no current disabilities for which service connection may be granted.

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Giplin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  The requirement that a current disability be present is satisfied "when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim...even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim."  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); see also Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  Here the Veteran has not shown by medical evidence the presence of a current right knee or back disability, nor does the evidence establish any physical functional impairment that would suggest such disabilities even in the absence of diagnoses. See Saunders v. Wilkie, No. 17-1466 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

As the claims file does not show any treatment for or diagnoses of right knee and back disabilities following separation from service, the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for these disabilities is denied.  In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claims and the positive and negative evidence is not nearly in balance, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity caused by a given disability.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  However, if different disability ratings are warranted for different periods of time over the life of a claim, "staged" ratings may be assigned.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for bilateral pes planus

The Veteran seeks a higher initial disability rating for his service-connected bilateral pes planus, which is currently rated as noncompensable (0 percent) under Diagnostic Code 5276. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Schedule of ratings - musculoskeletal system.

Under Diagnostic Code 5276, a 0 percent rating is assigned for mild symptoms, to include symptoms relieved by built-up shoe or arch support.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for moderate symptoms, to include weight-bearing line over or medial to great toe, inward bowing of the tendo achilles, and pain on manipulation and use of the feet.  Id.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for severe symptoms, with objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), including pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use, or characteristic callosities.  Id.  A 50 percent rating, the maximum schedular rating available, is assigned for pronounced symptoms, with marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, or marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo achilles on manipulation, which is not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances.  Id.

The terms "mild," "moderate," "severe," "marked" and "pronounced" are not defined in VA regulations or in Diagnostic Code 5276.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just."  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  That is, the use of descriptive terminology by medical examiners, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue.  All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

However, in discussing the meaning of the above terms, the Board is permitted to consult with a dictionary.  See Nielson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 56, 59 (2009) (it is commonplace to consult dictionaries to ascertain a term's ordinary meaning).  In fact, in a case involving a "headache" disability, the Court found error by the Board when it failed to define the terms "prostrating" and "very frequent," as the Court was left without a standard upon which to review the Board's decision.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018).  The Board thereby emphasizes its reliance on a medical dictionary to define a term is not in error.  See O'Bryan v. McDonald, 771 F.3d 1376, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (referencing Dorland's for nature of and symptoms associated with a condition).

Flat foot (pes planus) is defined as a condition in which one or more of the arches of the foot have been lowered and flattened out.  See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 416 (32nd ed. 2012).  "Pronounced" is defined as a degree greater than "severe" under Diagnostic Code 5276.  Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 311 (2015).  "Extreme" means existing in very high degree.  See Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extreme.  "Severe" means "of a great degree" or "serious."  See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 1140 (11th ed. 2003).  "Marked" is defined as "clearly defined and evident, noticeable."  See Webster's New World Dictionary, Third College Edition (2008) at 686.  "Moderate" is defined as "of average or medium quality, amount, scope, range, etc."  See Webster's New World Dictionary, Third College Edition (2008) at 721. However, the Court held that a "severe" disability under Diagnostic Code 5276 (pes planus) is not equivalent to a "severe" disability under Diagnostic Code 5284 (other foot injury) that is, what is classified as "severe" can be dependent on the diagnostic code used.  See Breniser v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 64, 76-77 (2011).

Upon review of the relevant evidence, the Board determines that an initial 10 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral pes planus is warranted.  During the April 2023 VA examination, the Veteran denied experiencing any foot pain or flare-ups.  The examiner noted decreased arch height with weight-bearing, but found no evidence of bowing or weight-bearing line over or medial to the great toe.  Post-service VA treatment records are silent for any reports of foot pain.  However, correspondence from the Veteran's representative asserts that the Veteran experiences bilateral foot pain due to his pes planus.  The Veteran is competent to describe his observable symptomatology, such as foot pain.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  Here, there is lay evidence that the Veteran experiences bilateral foot pain due to his pes planus, which demonstrates moderate symptoms under Diagnostic Code 5276 due to foot pain.  Therefore, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, an initial 10 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral pes planus is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for right hand disability, to include right hand pain, is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left hand disability is remanded.

The issues of entitlement to service connection for right hand and left-hand disabilities are remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the July 2023 rating decision on appeal.  The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023 prior to the July 2023 rating decision on appeal.  However, the examiner did not provide a medical opinion as to direct service connection for the Veteran's claimed right-hand disability, and the medical opinion as to the claimed left hand disability is incomplete and lacks adequate supporting rationale.

The Veteran's STRs show February 1979 treatment for a mild laceration to his right hand.  

His DD-214 reflects a military occupational specialty (MOS) as a fixed ciphony repairer for approximately 6 years.

During the July 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported bilateral hand pain.  While the examiner diagnosed residuals of a left-hand metacarpal fracture, there was no right hand diagnosis.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's current left hand diagnosis is not related to arthritis and, therefore, is not related to active service.  No further rationale was provided, to include discussion of the Veteran's MOS duties.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that the term "disability," as used in 38 U.S.C. §1110, "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability."  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  

When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  Therefore, a remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the June 2023 rating decision on appeal and obtain addendum medical opinions with adequate supporting rationale as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's left-hand disability and to determine whether the Veteran's right hand pain presents a functional impairment in earning capacity, and if so, whether this impairment is directly related to service.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Send the Veteran's claims file to an appropriate medical professional to obtain addendum opinions regarding the nature and etiology of any diagnosed right and/or left-hand disability, to include right and left-hand pain.  The Veteran's electronic claims file must be made accessible to the designated professional for review.  A well-reasoned rationale for any opinion expressed should be provided.  

Following the review of the claims file, the medical opinion provider is then requested to respond to the following: 

a.	Is it approximately at least as likely as not (an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) that the Veteran's reported right hand pain results in a functional impairment of earning capacity, i.e., a disability for VA purposes?

b.	Is it approximately at least as likely as not (an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) that any diagnosed right hand and/or left hand disability had its onset in service or is otherwise directly related to service?

In rendering the requested opinions, the medical opinion provider should consider and discuss: (1) the Veteran's STRs which reflect February 1979 treatment for right hand laceration; and (2) the Veteran's MOS duties as a fixed ciphony repairer.

If the requested opinions cannot be provided without a new examination, one should be scheduled.
