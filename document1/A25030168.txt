DOCKET NO. 240222-420483
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for eczema (claimed as rashes) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's eczema did not manifest during active service and is not otherwise causally or etiologically related to his active service, to include any toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) therein.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for eczema have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2000 to April 2004.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision.

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 and requested higher level review of a May 2023 rating decision.  In an October 2023 HLR decision, the AOJ determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the supplemental claim decision review option for additional development.  The AOJ subsequently denied the supplemental claim in the February 2024 rating decision.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in February 2024 and elected direct review.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Law and Analysis

The Veteran has not raised any issues with the pre-decisional duty to notify or duty to assist. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board . . . to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.  That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Eczema is not considered a chronic disease as enumerated for VA compensation purposes.  As such, the provisions for chronicity and continuity of symptomatology after discharge are not for application in this case. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for eczema (claimed as rashes).

The Veteran has claimed that he was soaked in fire suppression foam during service and that he now has rashes on the back of his legs, the folds of his arms opposite his elbows, his crotch, and his underarms. See May 2023 VA examination report; April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

In the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made favorable findings that the Veteran was diagnosed with pseudofolliculitis barbae during service, that he participated in a TERA due to his military occupational specialty of tactical aircraft maintenance, and that his diagnosis of eczema was confirmed in a May 2023 VA examination.  The Board is bound by those favorable findings, and they are supported by the evidence of record. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Thus, the only remaining question is whether the Veteran's eczema is related to his military service.

The Veteran's service treatment records do not document any complaints, treatment or diagnosis.  Although he was diagnosed with pseudofolliculitis barbae in service, he did not complain of and was not found to have any other skin condition.  In fact, he was documented as having no skin lesions or discoloration twice in October 2003, and in an October 2003 emergency nursing record indicated that there were no skin rashes.  In a March 2004 report of medical assessment, the Veteran also reported that he had not suffered from any injury or illness while on active duty for which he did not seek medical care, and a March 2004 physical examination did not find any skin rash or lesions.  

Moreover, the evidence does not show that the Veteran had eczema or skin rashes shortly after his military service.  In fact, a December 2004 VA general medical examination found that the Veteran's skin was normal, and an April 2005 VA treatment record indicated that there were no skin lesions, rashes, or ulcerations. VA treatment records dated from 2020 to 2022 also noted that there were no rashes or lesions and that the Veteran did not have any complaints regarding his skin.  

The Veteran has also not contended that he had eczema or skin rashes during service.  Rather, he has reported that he "now" gets rashes. See April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; May 2023 VA examination report.

For these reasons, the Board finds that eczema or skin rashes did not manifest in service.

In addition to the lack of evidence showing that eczema manifested during active service, the weight of the evidence of record does not persuasively show that the Veteran's current eczema is related to his military service, including any TERA therein.

A May 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's eczema is less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran.  She acknowledged that the Veteran served as a tactical aircraft maintenance technician and was exposed to fire form.  She explained that, although fire foam exposure can cause skin irritation after long periods, she did not believe that it was the cause of the Veteran's skin rash in this case.  In particular, the examiner found that there was no evidence of any medical treatment during service or at least one year thereafter. 

A December 2023 VA examiner also opined that the Veteran's eczema was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  She noted that there was no skin condition found during a VA examination in 2004 and that he was not diagnosed with eczema until 2023.  Thus, without chronicity during service or after service, the examiner stated that a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology.

The December 2023 VA examiner further opined that the Veteran's eczema was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran.  She explained that atopic dermatitis, which is the most common type of eczema, is caused by an overactive immune system that causes the skin barrier to become dry and itchy.   

There is no medical opinion relating the Veteran's eczema to his military service, including TERA therein.

The Board finds the May 2023 and December 2023 VA examiners' opinions to be probative, as they were provided by medical professionals with knowledge, training, and expertise.  There were also based on a review of the evidence, including the Veteran's reports, addressed the central issues in the case, and are supported by rationale. See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012) (an examination is not rendered inadequate where the rationale provided by an examiner "did not explicitly lay out the examiner's journey from the facts to a conclusion"); Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record).  

The Board has also considered the Veteran's lay statements that his current eczema is related to his military service, including TERA therein.  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), as to the specific issues in this case, the etiology of eczema, goes beyond a simple and immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship and falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person, particularly in light of the delayed onset of the disorder. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Moreover, even assuming that the Veteran is competent to attest to such matters, the Board finds that the specific, reasoned opinions of the VA examiners are of greater probative weight than the Veteran's general lay assertions in this regard.  The examiners reviewed the claims file, considered the Veteran's reported history and assertions, and relied on their own training, knowledge, and expertise to form the opinions.

For these reasons, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim.  Therefore, the Board concludes service connection is not warranted for eczema.
