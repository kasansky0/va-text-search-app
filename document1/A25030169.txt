ORDER

The appeal pertaining to the issue of entitlement to service connection for tinea pedis is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a rating decision issued in April 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office granted service connection for dermopathy with tinea pedis secondary to the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type II, effective March 29, 2011, which constitutes a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for service connection for tinea pedis have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1969 to July 1972 and from July 1972 to July 1976.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Notice of Disagreement in March 2024, selecting the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. See e.g., 38 C.F.R. § 20.101. In essence, a "case or controversy" involving a pending adverse determination to which the appellant has taken exception no longer exists. See Shoen v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 456, 457 (1994). 

In a rating decision issued in April 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office granted service connection for dermopathy with tinea pedis secondary to the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type II, effective March 29, 2011.  Such is confirmed by the most recent code sheet dated in September 2024, which reflects that the Veteran is in receipt of service connection for "type II diabetes mellitus with exudative diabetic maculopathy both eyes, dermopathy with tinea pedis, erectile dysfunction, peripheral artery disease".

Thus, the Board finds such award resulted in a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Baughman v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 563, 566 (1991).  Consequently, there is no longer a pending adverse determination for the Board to adjudicate.  Accordingly, the claim of entitlement to service connection for tinea pedis is moot and the Veteran's appeal must be dismissed. 

If the Veteran wishes to pursue a separate rating for tinea pedis or an increased rating for his type II diabetes mellitus with exudative diabetic maculopathy both eyes, dermopathy with tinea pedis, erectile dysfunction, peripheral artery disease, he should submit a claim for such on a proper form.
