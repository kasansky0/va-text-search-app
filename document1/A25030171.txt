REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Appellant is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished dental services to the Veteran on September 22 and September 29, 2021.

In October 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the Appellant electing the Direct Review docket to review a denial of payment for this dental care.  

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA dental care provided to the Veteran on September 22 and September 29, 2021, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  The record reflects that the claim was reprocessed and entitlement to payment was approved for the September 22 and September 29, 2021, episodes of care.  In explanation of payments sent to the Appellant in August 2023 and October 2023, the AOJ explained that the claim had been reprocessed and paid.

The Board acknowledges that the payment is less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care.  If the amount paid for the September 22 and September 29, 2021, episodes of care is disagreeable to the Appellant, they may file a separate appeal of that decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the September 22 and September 29, 2021, episode of care constitutes a reversal of the initial denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the Appellant disagrees and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)
