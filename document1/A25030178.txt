ORDER

Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, entitlement to a disability rating of 10 percent for hypertension is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hypertension is manifested by a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a disability rating of 10 percent for hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 2007 to August 2011. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The May 2024 rating decision was a higher-level review of a January 2024 rating decision. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Id. 

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for hypertension.

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating because he believes his hypertension is more severe than demonstrated by a noncompensable rating.   

Legal Criteria

Hypertension is rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension).  Under DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria.  Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common."  See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

Regarding the "minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control," this is intended to compensate veterans who do not have current readings establishing entitlement to a 10 percent rating if those veterans are using medication to control their blood pressure. Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75, 78 (2021). DC 7101 contemplates the ameliorative effects of medication and thus, a veteran can be entitled to a compensable rating even if he does not have current blood pressure readings above the statutory thresholds when there is a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more. McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 273 (2016). Pre-medication blood pressure readings are the appropriate data set when determining whether there is a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more. Wilson, 35 Vet. App. at 78. 

Factual Background

The Veteran states that he was diagnosed with high blood pressure at a doctor's appointment in December 2020 and placed on two different blood pressure medications. He reports that his blood pressure was consistently high, around 160/118, and he has had to change his diet and lifestyle considerably in response to his diagnosis. See August 2021 Statement in Support of Claim. 

The Veteran's medical records are consistent with his testimony that he had high blood pressure. In March 2021, he reported to his provider that he was having swelling in his knees and ankles. At a doctor's appointment about a week later, his blood pressure was 154/102 and was 160/116 upon retest. The Veteran was prescribed Losartan 25mg and Chlorthalidone 25mg daily, and his provider referred him to a nutritionist and planned to send him a blood pressure monitor. See March 2021 Alaska VAMC Records. 

Two months later, his blood pressure started improving. The Veteran reported that his 7-day average blood pressure was 148/86 and his 30-day average blood pressure was 154/89. See May 2021 Alaska VAMC Records. 

In April 2021, his blood pressure was 140/87. See April 2021 Alaska VAMC Records. In May 2021, he reported several blood pressures during May: 152/99, 141/95, 150/88, 135/93, 164/85, 156/98, 138/89, 151/87, 135/62, 145/85, and 126/88.  As the Veteran's hypertension was still out of control, one of the Veteran's two blood pressure medications, Losartan, was increased to 50mg daily. See May 2021 Alaska VAMC Records.

In June 2021, as the Veteran's blood pressure was still over the Veteran's blood pressure goal of 130/80, the Veteran's medication, Losartan, was increased again to 100mg daily. See June 2021 Alaska VAMC Records. In a July 2021 appointment, his blood pressure had decreased to 131/84. See July 2021 Alaska VAMC Records.

In August 2021, the Veteran reported to his provider that his 30-day blood pressure average was 138/73. See August 2021 Alaska VAMC Records.

In August 2021, the Veteran was afforded a hypertension VA examination. The Veteran attended an in-person examination. The examiner noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension by his VA primary care provider with blood pressure readings of 160/116 and 154/102. The examiner noted that the Veteran's hypertension was controlled on continuous medication, and the report included three normal blood pressure readings from August 2021. 

In January 2022, the Veteran was afforded another hypertension VA examination. The Veteran's records were reviewed. The examiner noted a hypertension diagnosis from November 2021. The report notes several blood pressure readings from August, September, and December 2021, and reports that the Veteran's hypertension is "presently controlled on Losartan and chlorthalidone." 

Analysis

For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that the Veteran has a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more requiring continuous medication for control, corresponding to the criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 7101.

The Board acknowledges that both VA examiners stated that the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more. See August 2021 and January 2022 VA examinations. In accordance with the Wilson case and given that the Veteran's hypertension requires medication for treatment, the Board must consider readings during the appeal period, as well as blood pressure readings prior to the appeal period to determine whether the Veteran has a history of diastolic pressure of 100 or more. 35 Vet. App. at 78. 

The Veteran's medical records show readings of diastolic pressure under 100; however, the Veteran's diastolic pressure did not lower under 100 until he was put on continuous medication in March 2021. Although the record has several normal blood pressures after the Veteran's hypertension became controlled and after several months of increasing the dosage of medications, the record only has two blood pressures before medication was prescribed. Blood pressures of 162/116 and 154/102 were noted in the March 2021 record.  Given that the Veteran reported knee and ankle swelling for two months prior to his March 2021 diagnosis of hypertension, it is reasonable to assume that his blood pressure had been at similarly high levels for at least two months. As such, giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and given that the Veteran requires medication to control his blood pressure, the Board finds that the Veteran has a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control. Therefore, entitlement to a disability of 10 percent for hypertension is granted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

Accordingly, during the appeal period, the Veteran's hypertension is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control, corresponding to the criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 7101. 

However, a higher 20 percent rating under DC 7101 is not warranted unless diastolic pressure is predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure is predominantly 200 or more. The aforementioned medical records only show one diastolic reading that was 110 or more and no diastolic readings that are 200 or more. Thus, during the appeal period, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. Accordingly, the Veteran's hypertension does not more nearly approximate the criteria corresponding to a 20 percent rating. A higher 20 percent rating is therefore not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.
