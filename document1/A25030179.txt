ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to service connection for headaches is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not timely file a VA Form 10182, and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) to extend the time for filing with respect to the rating decision that was issued on February 12, 2019, for the issue of entitlement to service connection for headaches.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an extension for the filing of a VA Form 10182 with respect to the rating decision issued on February 12, 2019, for the issue of service connection for headaches have not been met, and the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was not otherwise timely received. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the Army National Guard from February 2003 to December 2003 and from September 2011 to October 2012.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2019 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board shall not entertain an application for review on appeal unless it conforms to the law. See 38 U.S.C. § 7108. An appeal consists of a properly completed VA Form 10182 submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202, 20.203. A claimant may request an extension of the period for filing an appeal for good cause. A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

In considering the effect of an untimely appeal to the Board, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) has consistently held that the timeliness of filing is a mandatory claims-processing rule, not a jurisdictional statute. See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024), Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021). The VA may waive its objection to an untimely appeal and properly adjudicate a matter when there has been such a waiver. Failure to file a timely appeal does not automatically foreclose an appeal, render a claim final, or deprive the Board of jurisdiction. Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 42 (2009).

After a review of the record, the Board could not identify any correspondence that may be interpreted as a request to accept the untimely appeal under the good cause exception. Therefore, consideration of good cause is not applicable. The remaining question before the Board is whether the issue of timeliness was waived.

The Court has previously held the Board waived timeliness when the VA engaged in "substantive and procedural development" when the appeal was scheduled for a hearing, and the hearing was held. See Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 47. In this case, after the Veteran filed his VA Form 10182, the Board placed his appeal on the Direct Review docket. The notification advised the Veteran of the next steps for his appeal, what to do if he wished to switch dockets, how to submit documents to the Board, and other pertinent information. After this letter, the Board's only actions taken were to send automated messages to the Veteran advising him the appeal was still docketed and would be addressed in docket order.

In general, adding an appeal to a docket is not a substantive action. Rather, it simply puts the appeal "in line" for substantive, individualized fact-based review. Here, because the Board did not engage in substantive and procedural development such as those discussed in Percy, the issue of timely filing has not been waived.

Because the appeal for headaches was filed more than one year after the AOJ rating decision, evidence of good cause was not submitted, and the Board did not waive the issue, the appeal is untimely. Therefore, the February 2019 rating decision became final.

Accordingly, since good cause has not been shown for extending the time to file a VA Form 10182, and because the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was not timely filed, the appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for head is dismissed.

While the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's request, the law is dispositive, and the Board is bound by the laws and regulations governing VA benefits. The Board may only grant entitlement to VA benefits authorized by law and does not have the authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c). Should the Veteran wish to file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) for service connection for headaches, instructions on how to do so will be attached to this decision.
