REMANDED

The discontinuance of entitlement to a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) from March 1, 2024, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1998 to November 2015.

 The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. As the Board is remanding the claim of discontinuance of entitlement to a TDIU from March 1, 2024, for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.

Although the Board regrets the additional delay, a remand is necessary to ensure that due process is followed and there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claim so that he is afforded every possible consideration. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).

The Veteran contends that the February 2024 rating decision that discontinued entitlement to a TDIU effective March 1, 2024, was improper. 

A total disability rating may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as the result of service-connected disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. Consideration may be given to a veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

When reducing an award of TDIU, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) are for application. 38 C.F.R. § 3.343(c)(1). However, in such a determination, actual employability must be established by clear and convincing evidence. Id.

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) allow for the reduction in evaluation of a service-connected disability when warranted by the evidence, but only after following certain procedural guidelines. First, there must be a rating action proposing the reduction, and giving the veteran 60 days to submit additional evidence and request a predetermination hearing. If a hearing is not requested, and reduction is still warranted, a rating action will be taken to effectuate the reduction. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), (i)(2). The effective date of the reduction will be the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the Veteran of the final action expires. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), (i)(2)(i). However, in this instance, the Board notes that the AOJ reduced the TDIU benefits from the last paid date as noted in the Veterans Benefits Administration Manual M21-1 in section VIII.iv.3.D.2.a. 

By way of history, in an April 2021 rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to a TDIU effective May 6, 2020. 

Thereafter, in a September 2023 notification letter, the AOJ proposed to discontinue entitlement to a TDIU based on upon evidence suggesting that the Veteran participated in gainful employment during the previous calendar year. Specifically, the AOJ stated that it received information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) indicating that the Veteran earned wages above the poverty threshold for the calendar year of 2022. The September 2023 notification letter informed the Veteran that in order to continue receiving TDIU, he must complete and returned the attached VA Form 21-4140 Employment Questionnaire, and VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim to explain his earned wages for calendar year 2022. The letter also informed the Veteran that he could submit evidence showing that the reduction should not be made, that his payments would not be adjusted for 60 days, and that he had the right to a representative and a hearing.

The Veteran did not respond to the September 2023 notification letter. 

In the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ discontinued the Veteran's TDIU rating as it stated it did not receive VA Form 21-4140. Thus, the Veteran's TDIU was discontinued based solely on a finding that the Veteran failed to return the VA Form 21-4140.

Initially, the Board finds that the AOJ complied with the due process requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) by issuing the September 2020 letter which proposed the discontinuance of TDIU benefits. The Veteran was then given the appropriate time within which to provide additional evidence. Thereafter, the AOJ promulgated the February 2024 rating decision, implementing the proposed discontinuance, effective March 1, 2024. Thus, as the notice and due process requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) have been met, no further discussion in this regard is necessary.

As stated above, a rating of a 100 percent disability based on TDIU may be reduced, subject to the procedural protections of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), but caution must be exercised in such a determination that actual employability is established by clear and convincing evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.343(c)(1). If a Veteran with TDIU begins to engage in a substantially gainful occupation after January 1, 1985, the Veteran's rating may not be reduced solely on the basis of such occupation unless the veteran maintains the occupation for a period of twelve consecutive months. 38 C.F.R. § 3.343(c)(2). The "clear and convincing" standard requires that capacity for work be proven to a "reasonable certainty" but not necessarily be "undebatable." Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254, 258 (1999).

Under the AMA, only pre-decisional duty to assist errors are eligible for remand. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Therefore, if the Board identifies a duty to assist error that existed at the time of the AOJ's decision on the claim under review, the claim must be returned for correction of the error and readjudication. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601(g).

After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that remand is necessary as the AOJ failed to obtain the proper evidence to show that the discontinuance of the Veteran's TDIU benefits was warranted. Significantly, even though the SSA indicated that the Veteran earned wages above the poverty threshold for the calendar year of 2022, the AOJ did not identify any evidence of record which suggests that the Veteran had gainful occupation in 2022 or was capable of securing or following gainful employment, and only discontinued the TDIU benefits because the Veteran did not submit the VA Form 21-4140. Furthermore, the SSA letter that the AOJ relied upon is not associated with the Veteran's claim folder. The AOJ was to verify whether the Veteran was substantially gainfully employed for a period of twelve consecutive months and that it was "clear and convincing" prior to discontinuing TDIU benefits. The AOJ needed to exercise more caution before proceeding to discontinue entitlement to a TDIU to meet the clear and convincing standard. However, the AOJ discontinued the TDIU benefits before verifying this information. 

Consequently, as the AOJ did not properly verify whether the Veteran was engaged in substantially gainful employment during calendar year 2022 and the AOJ discontinued the TDIU benefits before verifying this information, the Board finds that there was a duty to assist error and remand is warranted to obtain additional information. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. The AOJ must obtain and associate with the claims file any outstanding records from the Social Security Administration (SSA), to include evidence that the Veteran earned wages above the poverty threshold for the calendar year 2022. If the search for such records has negative results, the claims file must be properly documented as to the unavailability of these records.

2. Ask the Veteran to submit information regarding his work history since 2022, to include employment records and wage stubs/payments for the calendar year 2022. He should submit any evidence showing that, since 2022, he continues to be unable to secure or maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities.
