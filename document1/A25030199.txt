ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right tibialis posterior tendonitis (right ankle disability) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's right ankle disability manifested by limitation of plantar flexion of not less than 20 degrees and limitation of dorsiflexion of not less than 5 degrees; there was no more than moderate limited motion of the ankle.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for a right ankle disability were not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes (DCs) 5024-5271.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the United States Navy from July 1988 to July 1994.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 higher-level review rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Increased Ratings

Regarding increased ratings, generally, disability evaluations are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1. 

Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Disabilities must be reviewed in relation to their history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Other applicable, general policy considerations are: interpreting reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability, 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; resolving any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability in favor of the claimant, 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; where there is a question as to which of two evaluations apply, assigning a higher of the two where the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating, 38 C.F.R. § 4.7; and, evaluating functional impairment on the basis of lack of usefulness, and the effects of the disability upon the person's ordinary activity, 38 C.F.R. § 4.10. See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). It is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified; findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability there from are sufficient; and above all, a coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

Musculoskeletal Disabilities

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011). At the same time, diseases under DCs 5013 through 5024 are evaluated as degenerative arthritis, based on limitation of motion of affected parts. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Note to DCs 5013 through 5024.

Benefit of the Doubt

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021). When, after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding service origin, the degree of disability, or any other point, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a). Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss each, and every piece of evidence submitted by the Veteran or on his behalf. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000). That is to say that where the Board is silent as to a specific piece of evidence it must be presumed "that the Board considered this evidence and found it too scant to warrant comment." See Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 555 (2008). The Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to it. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000).

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for a right ankle disability is denied.

The Veteran seeks a 20 percent rating for his right ankle disability. He concludes that the July 2023 VA examiner's estimate of dorsiflexion during a flare-up limited to 5 degrees had no basis and that there was a significant reduction from his non-flare-up range of motion. See May 2024 VA Form 10182. 

The Veteran's right ankle disability (right tibialis posterior tendonitis) is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5271, for limitation of motion of the ankle. Prior to February 7, 2021, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle and a 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle. Id. From February 7, 2021, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle (less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion.) A 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion.). Id.

The Board acknowledges that VA amended the rating criteria for DC 5271 during the review period. See 85 Fed. Reg. 76,453 (Nov. 30, 2020). However, the Board finds that doing so served to adopt the pre-amendment VA Adjudication Manual definition of "marked" and "moderate" limitation of motion of the ankle in terms of degrees. That is to say that the amendment merely added to the regulation what the ROs were already doing. Consequently, the Board presumes that rating ankle disabilities under DC 5271 was left virtually unchanged by the amendment.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's right ankle disability because dorsiflexion measured no less than 5 degrees and plantar flexion measured no less than 20 degrees during the review period.

The Veteran was afforded a July 2023 VA examination to assess his right ankle disability. A questionnaire was completed in conjunction with an in-person examination and records review. The examiner confirmed a diagnosis of right tibialis posterior tendinitis (or "right ankle condition"). The Veteran reported progressive ankle pain, which started with soft tissue injury of the right ankle in November 1990. The course since onset had progressed or worsened. The duration of symptoms was 12 to 24 hours. The characteristics of symptoms was constant achy pain at night, sharp pain with walking, and swelling. Precipitating factors included prolonged walking and standing. Treatment included Tylenol, Motrin 800 mg, brace, and ankle wrap. Alleviating factors included medication, foot soak, and hot or cold compress. The severity was moderate. See July 2023 VA Examination.

The Veteran also reported functional loss, including but not limited to repeated use over time, described in his own words as "Prolong walking and standing causes a lot of pain and I am unable to perform task like exercising." He did not report or have a history of instability of the ankle. Initial range of motion (ROM) measurements of the right ankle were abnormal or outside of normal range. ROM itself did not contribute to functional loss. Active ROM was as follows: Plantar flexion endpoint was 35 degrees. Dorsiflexion endpoint was 15 degrees. Passive ROM was the same as active ROM. Pain was exhibited with ROM over all planes with both active and passive ROM. There was no evidence of pain on weight-bearing, non-weight-bearing, or on rest or non-movement. Pain was noted not to cause functional loss. There was no objective evidence of crepitus and no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the ankle joint or associated soft tissue. Id.

The Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing with at least three repetitions. There was no additional loss of function after the same. He was not examined immediately after repeated use over time. However, procured evidence, to include statements from the Veteran, suggested that pain alone significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over time. Based on the foregoing, the examiner was able to estimate additional functional loss in the right ankle joint immediately after repeated use over time as follows: Plantar flexion endpoint was 30 degrees. Dorsiflexion endpoint was 10 degrees. Id.

Similarly, the examination was not conducted during a flare-up. However, unlike with repeated use over time, with flare-ups, procured evidence, to include statements from the Veteran, suggested that pain, to include lack of endurance, significantly limited functional ability. Based on the additional factor identified (i.e., lack of endurance), the examiner was able to estimate additional functional loss in the right ankle joint during a flare-up as follows: Plantar flexion endpoint was 20 degrees. Dorsiflexion endpoint was 5 degrees. Id.

These estimates correspond with no more than a 10 percent rating under the applicable criteria. That is to say that they do not correspond with the criteria for a higher 20 percent rating. The Board finds the July 2023 VA examiner's opinions regarding additional functional loss probative because they are consistent with procured evidence, to include statements from the Veteran. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain, lack of endurance, pain during repetitive use over time, and pain during flare-ups. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements that constant achy pain at night, sharp pain with walking, and swelling, which occurred monthly and lasted 12 to 24 hours, would not result in symptoms more nearly approximate to marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion.). The Veteran has not demonstrated the requisite medical expertise to provide such an estimate.

The Board has considered whether any other DCs related to ankle disabilities would provide for a higher rating. However, the evidence does not reflect that the symptoms would warrant a higher rating under a different DC. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. During the review period, there was no medial tibial stress syndrome, no stress fractures, no achilles tendonitis, no achilles tendon rupture, no ankylosis of the ankle, subastragalar, or tarsal joint; there was no malunion of calcaneus or astragalus; and no astragalectomy. A July 2017 weight-bearing x-ray of the right ankle revealed no underlying bone disease or evidence of injury. See July 2023 VA Examination.

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for a right ankle disability. As such, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Accordingly, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for a right ankle disability is denied.
