REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral foot condition is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1977 to October 1980.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.301. 

Because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Veteran seeks service connection for a foot disorder. Other than his enlistment examination and a few personnel records, the majority of the Veteran's service records are unavailable for review. The AOJ exhausted all efforts to obtain his service records and notified the Veteran in February 2020 that his records cannot be located and were unavailable for review.

When service records are missing through no fault of the claimant, VA has a heightened obligation to consider the applicability of the benefit of the doubt rule, to assist the claimant in developing his claim, and to explain its decision. See O'Hare v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 365 (1991). Additionally, "if VA becomes aware of the existence of relevant records before deciding the claim, VA will notify the claimant of the records and request that the claimant provide a release for the records." 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.159(e)(2).

Here, the Veteran's VA treatment records do not show VA treatment for any foot condition. Instead, they show that he had a private podiatrist. These records are not in the claims file and the AOJ did not make a specific attempt to obtain a release for them. In light of VA's heightened obligation to assist the Veteran in developing his claim, the Board finds this constitutes a pre-decisional error, and a remand is warranted to attempt to obtain the outstanding, relevant private treatment records.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for the private podiatrist who was treating him in 2019. Make two requests for the authorized records unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.
