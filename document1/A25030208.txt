DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis, including as due to military service in Southwest Asia, is granted pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act). 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran performed active-duty service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations after August 2, 1990.    

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for presumptive service connection for chronic sinusitis pursuant to the PACT Act, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 2006 to March 2007, February 2011 to March 2011, July 2012 to June 2013, August 2019 to September 2020.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO), Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In August 2022, the PACT Act codified chronic sinusitis as a condition that is now presumed to be associated with exposure to burn pits or other toxins for Veterans with a qualifying period of active service.  See Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (Aug. 10, 2022) (PACT Act); September 2022 VA Decision Memorandum: PACT Act Implementation.  

Under the PACT Act, unless affirmative evidence proves otherwise, any covered Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to certain substances, chemicals, and airborne hazards during their service.  A "covered Veteran" means any Veteran who on or after August 2, 1990, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, or United Arab Emirates; or on or after September 11, 2001, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Uzbekistan, or any other country determined relevant by the Secretary.  When a covered Veteran manifests certain diseases, including chronic bronchitis, chronic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, and asthma diagnosed after service, such disability shall be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated during active military, naval, air, or space service, notwithstanding that there is no record of evidence of such disease during the period of service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F. 3rd 1391 (2021).

Entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis.

The Veteran asserts that he has chronic sinusitis due to his service in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  

First, under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).  In the May 2024 rating decision, the AOJ conceded that the Veteran served in a toxic risk exposure area (TERA) and found that he has acute sinusitis.  See January 2023, VA Memo, confirming deployments to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.  See also, May 2024 VA examination.

In this case, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show no evidence of complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of a sinus condition.  Periodic Health Assessments, undated, show evidence the Veteran did not check the box for sinus disease at any time.  The toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) memorandum indicates the Veteran received fire pay, imminent danger pay, and hazardous duty pay while serving in Southwest Asia.  

After a period of active service, a November 2015 Health Questionnaire for Dental Treatment indicates no check mark for sinus disease.  After his 2020 service, in May 2021, the Veteran sought VA treatment for his sinus/rhinitis condition.  A May 2021 imaging scan (CT) of the Veteran found "bilateral paranasal sinus disease as described most prominently involving the bilateral ethmoids, dependent left maxillary and left interior frontal sinuses."  See May 2021 VA treatment record.  July 2021, VA treatment records indicate the Veteran was diagnosed with mild sinus disease that is relatively asymptomatic.  The Veteran's VA treatment records also include multiple indications of "chronic sinusitis."  See, e.g., April 2024, VAMC Other Output/Reports.  

In May 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination.  See May 2024 Sinusitis/Rhinitis DBQ.  The Veteran was diagnosed with allergic rhinitis and acute sinusitis.  Id.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran did not have any findings, signs, or symptoms attributable to chronic sinusitis, but did note he had nasal polyps though he did not have any hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates.  Id.  The examiner further documented that the Veteran had not experienced any episodes of non-incapacitating or incapacitating sinusitis within the past year.  Id.  The examiner indicated computed tomography (CT) imaging was conducted in 2021.  The examiner also noted the imaging report states: "scattered moderate mucosal thickening, bilateral concha L>R and a dependent left maxillary polyp, mucus retention cyst."  The examiner concluded the Veteran had a diagnosis of acute sinusitis but found no diagnosis of chronic sinusitis.  

The Veteran's representative submitted an October 2024, Appellate Brief.  The Veteran argues that the May 2024 VA examination was for presumptive service connection and no other theories of entitlement were requested.  However, as will be shown, direct service connection is not available to the Veteran.  

The Board finds that for any type of service connection, the Veteran meets the first element of a disability of chronic sinusitis.  While the VA examiner found a diagnosis of acute sinusitis, there are several VA treatment records that indicate a diagnosis of "chronic sinusitis."  And from the record, that diagnosis was first given in May 2021 when the Veteran sought treatment and had his CT scan within a year of discharge from service.  See May 2021, VAMC Other Output/Reports.  Therefore, giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, he has a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis.  

For the second element, the AOJ has conceded the Veteran served in a toxic exposure risk activity area (TERA) and the Board will not overturn this finding.  Therefore, the second element is met because the Veteran served in Southwest Asia.  

For the third element, the Veteran claims his chronic sinusitis is due to military service in Southwest Asia.  He complained of sinus problems several months after discharge from active service in Southwest Asia and the AOJ has conceded he served in a TERA and his May 2021, September 2021 VA treatment records, show diagnosis of chronic sinusitis.  The VA examiner noted he has a nasal polyp.  While his symptoms may wane at times and be mild or asymptomatic at the time of the May 2024 VA examination, the extent of his sinus problems are not before the Board at this time.  Also, a March 2021 VA examination indicates the Veteran had no sinus symptoms or problems.  In other words, the evidence shows no nexus for direct service connection.  However, giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds service connection is warranted on a presumptive basis for chronic sinusitis.

Therefore, the Board finds that VA has confirmed the Veteran's service in Southwest Asia.  Additionally, the Veteran's VA treatment records show the Veteran has a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis.

Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for chronic sinusitis is warranted under the PACT Act.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120.
