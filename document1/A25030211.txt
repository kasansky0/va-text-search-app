ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for bulging disc (claimed as neck pain) is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 16, 2023, for the award of service connection for bulging disc is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's bulging disc is manifest by limitation of motion and pain; unfavorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine has not been shown.

2. The first communication that the Veteran would like to file a claim for his bulging disc was received by VA on August 16, 2023. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for bulging disc have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5327.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than August 16, 2023, for the award of service connection for?bulging disc have not been met.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from March 1974 to March 1977. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Finally, the Board notes that in the April 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran also requested review of the issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU).  This issue was not addressed in the December 2023 rating decision and although not explicitly stated so, the Board presumes the Veteran intended to raise this issue under Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), wherein it was held that a request for TDIU, whether expressly raised by a Veteran or a reasonably raised by the record, is not a separate "claim" for benefits, but rather, can be a part of a claim for increased compensation.  Id. at 453-54.  Nevertheless, the Board declines to address entitlement to TDIU as part of the present appeal as it was previously claimed and is already being addressed within the VA benefits system.  Specifically, in October 2022, the Veteran filed a claim for TDIU.  The Veteran appealed the denial of that claim and in a December 2024 decision, the Board remanded the issue of entitlement to TDIU in another Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) appeal stream in connection with a February 2023 VA Form 10182.  This matter continues to undergo development before the AOJ, see e.g., February 2025 Development Letter, and will be addressed by the AOJ when all necessary development has been completed.

1. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for bulging disc

The Veteran was granted service connection for his bulging disc (claimed as neck pain) and assigned a 30 percent rating, effective August 16, 2023, in the December 2023 rating decision on appeal.  The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his service-connected bulging disc disability.  The Veteran has not provided a specific contention. 

Disability evaluations are determined by application of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.? 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and there must be emphasis upon the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Examination reports are to be interpreted in light of the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the appellant working or seeking work.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. 

Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and a higher initial disability rating is at issue, the level of disability at the time entitlement arose is of primary concern.  Consideration must also be given to a longitudinal picture of the veteran's disability to determine if the assignment of separate ratings for separate periods of time, a practice known as "staged" ratings, is warranted.  Staged ratings are appropriate in any increased rating claim in which distinct time periods with different ratable symptoms can be identified.  See Fenderson v. West,?12?Vet. App.?119?(1999), Hart v. Mansfield,?21?Vet. App.?505?(2007). 

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent rating for a diagnostic code, a zero percent rating will be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  The spine has no opposite joint.

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

The Veteran's bulging disc is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5237.  Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 40 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the cervical spine greater than 170 degrees but not greater than 335 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 15 degrees but not greater than 30 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the cervical spine not greater than 170 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine to 15 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine.  A 100 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Id. at Note 1.  

Unfavorable ankylosis is defined as "a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching."  Id.  at Note 5.  Additionally, fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) is "always" considered favorable ankylosis.  Id.  

In this case, the Veteran is in receipt of a 30 percent rating for his bulging disc disorder.  As will be discussed more fully below, the Board finds that a higher rating is not warranted.

The Veteran's VA treatment records include complaints of neck pain and treatment for the bulging disc disability.  Specifically, the Veteran reported that his neck stiffens throughout the day. Additionally, the Veteran has received care from a chiropractor and pain specialist. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination with medical opinion provided in November 2023.  The Veteran reported being involved in a military vehicle accident while in service and having neck pain ever since.  Specifically, he experienced pain that radiated to his shoulders.  The Veteran reported he did not experience flare-ups and he did not experience muscle spasms or guarding.  The Veteran described functional loss due to pain which included being unable to grab or lift objects and experiencing pain while extending his arms to drive.  The examiner documented range of motion with flexion at 30 degrees, extension at 35 degrees, right lateral flexion at 30 degrees, left lateral flexion at 10 degrees, right lateral rotation at 40 degrees, and left lateral rotation at 30 degrees.  Pain was observed on right and left lateral flexion and right and left lateral rotation.  Passive range of motion testing was not performed, and the examiner explained that manipulation of the neck could lead to further increase in pain.  No additional loss of function or range of motion was noted after three repetitions.  The Veteran was not examined after repeated use over time, however, the examiner noted that procured evidence suggested functional loss due to pain and the examiner documented estimated range of motion with flexion at 15 degrees, extension at 15 degrees, right and left lateral flexion at 10 degrees, and right and left lateral rotation at 10.  Radiculopathy and ankylosis was not present.  As mentioned above, the Veteran did not report experiencing flare-ups and the examiner noted that procured evidence did not suggest functional loss due to flare-ups.  Additionally, the examiner noted the Veteran did not have any other neurological abnormalities nor intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS).  The examiner also noted that the Veteran did not use any assistive devices.  However, the examiner found that functionally the Veteran would be unable to look over the shoulder or reach out and pick up objects in front of him.

After reviewing the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's bulging disc.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain and pain during repetitive use over time that caused difficulty reaching for and lifting objects, looking over the shoulder, and pain while driving.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements that he has difficulty reaching for or lifting objects, or looking over the shoulder, and pain while driving would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating unfavorable ankylosis or its functional equivalent of the entire cervical spine. 

Ankylosis is defined as the "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure." See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 94 (31st ed. 2007).  In Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021), the Court held that "application of [38 C.F.R.] §§ 4.40 and 4.45 permits consideration under the General Rating Formula of an evaluation based on ankylosis if a claimant's functional loss is consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis, in other words, if it is the functional equivalent of ankylosis."  In this case, the Veteran has neither reported, nor does the record suggest, that his bulging disc is immobile.  While the Veteran has reported stiffness in his neck and his bulging disc has significant limited motion, even with pain or after repeated use, it is not shown to be fixed in flexion, extension, or lateral rotation.  Additionally, the November 2023 VA examiner specifically determined there was no evidence of ankylosis. 

Consideration has also been given to assigning a rating under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  However, the Veteran does not have IVDS and the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran was ever prescribed bed rest by a physician for a duration that meets the criteria for a higher rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  

Regarding neurological impairment, the lay and medical evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran has any other neurological abnormality associated with the cervical spine disability.

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 30 percent for bulging disc.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 30 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 16, 2023, for the award of service connection bulging disc 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than August 16, 2023, for his bulging disc disability.  

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A "claim" is defined in the VA regulations as "a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws prescribed by [VA] submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary."  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  Pursuant to?38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d), a complete claim is required for all types of claims and will generally be considered filed as of the date it was received by VA for an evaluation of award of benefits.  If VA receives a complete claim within 1 year of the filing of an intent to file a claim that meets the requirements of?38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b), it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the intent to file a claim. 

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  The amendments also, inter alia, eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen.  See?79 Fed. Reg. 57,660?(Sept. 25, 2014), codified as amended at?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.157.  The amended regulations, however, apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.  Prior to the March 24, 2015, amendment, VA accepted both formal and informal claims.

A review of the claims file shows that VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim for the Veteran's neck condition on August 16, 2023, the date of the initial claim for this disability.  There is no earlier communication evidencing the Veteran's intent to file a claim for his neck condition.  Notably, when the Veteran filed his August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, he claimed "neck pain" and indicated that this was the result of an in-service truck accident wherein he injured his neck and back.  However, when he filed an earlier claim for a "back condition" he stated only that it occurred in service and did not mention the neck.  See February 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  Therefore, the first indication from the Veteran that he wanted to file a claim for his bulging disc was received by VA on August 16, 2023.

As indicated, the relevant regulations require the effective date of the award be the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues a claim or an issue.  See?38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h); see also 38?C.F.R. §?3.400.  The record indicates that the date of the initial claim is August 16, 2023.  The Veteran does not contend that he filed a claim earlier than that date.  Indeed, neither the Veteran nor his private attorney has offered any specific contentions for why they believe an earlier effective date is warranted in this matter.

As there is no legal basis for the assignment of any earlier effective date, and because the evidence is not in approximate balance in favor of the Veteran and is persuasively balanced against the claim for any earlier effective date, the appeal must be denied.  See?38 U.S.C. § 5107(b);?38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough,?21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
