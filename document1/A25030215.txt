DOCKET NO. 240819-465371
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of April 24, 2023, for service connection for migraine is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

1. The Veteran's initial claim of entitlement to service connection for migraine (claimed as due to COVID) was denied in a January 2022 rating decision; she did not timely appeal that decision, and as such, that decision is considered final.

2. The Veteran filed another initial claim of entitlement to service connection for migraine on April 24, 2023 that was rejected for being on the improper form; the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim on June 27, 2023 that was unsigned; the Veteran submitted a signed Supplement Claim (signed and dated June 27, 2023) on July 26, 2023; the Veteran resubmitted the signed Supplement Claim (signed and dated June 27, 2023) again on January 18, 2024; in a July 17, 2024 rating decision the Veteran was awarded service connection to migraine with an effective date of January 18, 2024, the date VA received the final Supplemental Claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of April 24, 2023, for the award of service connection for migraine have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1, 3.102, 3.400, 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from April 2016 to April 2021.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from July 2024 rating decision issued by a Regional Office of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

Entitlement to an effective date of April 24, 2023, for service connection for migraine is granted.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 18, 2024 for service connection for migraine. 

The statutory and regulatory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award of disability compensation are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Except as specifically provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award for pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations clarifies that an award of direct service connection will be effective on the day following separation from active military service or the date on which entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the appellant's claim or the date on which entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

As to what constitutes a claim, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). The term "claim" means a communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its adjudication regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014). This rule making also eliminated the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims for increase and revised 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

As noted above, the Veteran maintains entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 18, 2024 for the grant of entitlement to service connection for migraine. 

For the reasons outlined below, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of an effective date of April 24, 2023, but no earlier, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for migraine. 

By way of background, the Veteran initially filed a claim for entitlement of service connection for migraine on June 18, 2021. The AOJ denied the Veteran's service connection claim for migraine in its January 13, 2022 rating decision. See January 2022 Rating Decision. The Veteran did not appeal this decision within one year and as such, that decision is considered final. 

On April 24, 2023, the Veteran filed another initial claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) listing entitlement to service connection for migraine. 

On May 1, 2023, VA notified the Veteran by letter that because her migraine claim was previously denied, the Veteran must select to have her prior claim reviewed either as a Higher-Level Review Decision, Supplemental Claim, or Board Appeal. The letter outlined information on each of these review options, listed the required forms for each review option, and included contact information in case the Veteran needed assistance with her claim. See May 2023 AMA Review Letter, at 1-2. 

On June 27, 2023, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) listing entitlement to service connection for migraine. 

On June 30, 2023, VA notified the Veteran by letter that her Supplemental Claim was being returned because it was incomplete. The claim was incomplete because it was missing a signature. See June 2023 VA 20-0995; June 2023 VA Letter. The letter stated that "[i]f we receive your completed application within one year from the date we received your incomplete application, we will consider your claim filed as of the date of receipt of your incomplete application." See June 2023 VA Letter, at 1.

On July 26, 2023, the Veteran re-submitted the signed copy of her Supplemental Claim. The Supplemental Claim was dated June 27, 2023, the date of her original filing. See July 2023 Correspondence, at 2.

On January 18, 2024, the Veteran re-submitted her Supplemental Claim, which was a duplicate copy of the form submitted on July 26, 2023 (dated June 27, 2023). See January 2024 VA Form 20-0995. In its July 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted the Veteran entitlement to service connection for migraine with an effective date of January 18, 2024, the date of the most recent Supplemental Claim submission. 

For Supplemental Claims under AMA received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of the receipt of the Supplemental Claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

Following a review of the record, the Board finds that there is a basis for an earlier effective date. The Board finds that although the Veteran filed a claim for service connection on the wrong form, received on the April 24, 2023, the Board liberally construes this as an intent to file a claim. The Veteran then attempted to file the claim on the appropriate form on June 27, 2023, but it was unsigned. The Veteran then submitted a signed Supplement Claim (signed and dated June 27, 2023) on July 26, 2023, and again on January 18, 2024. If the VA receives the correct form within one year, the Veteran maintains his effective date on the date the intent to file a claim was received. As stated, the Veteran submitted his claim on the correct VA Form well within one year.

After careful consideration, the Board concludes that the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date of April 24, 2023, for the award of service connection for migraines. The April 24, 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ, as liberally construed by the Board, was an intent to file a claim and the Veteran submitted the correct form within one year of his intent to file.
