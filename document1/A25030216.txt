DOCKET NO. 240319-426693
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

As the statutory limit has been reached, the grant of special monthly compensation (SMC) based on loss of use of a creative organ under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k), effective April 9, 2023, does not entitle additional compensation payments and, to that extent, the appeal is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran was found entitled to SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k), effective April 9, 2023, but his monthly compensation payments at that time were $4,708.78 per month, which exceeds the statutory limit.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for additional compensations payments for the award of SMC at the (k) level, but also in accordance with statutory limits governing monetary awards, effective April 9, 2023, are not met as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 1114, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350 (a)(1), (i) 3.352.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1986 to January 1992.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO), subsequently reviewed in a January 2024 Higher Level Review (HLR).  

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

VA Compensation Payments for Monetary Benefit Awards

The Veteran's attorney contends that the Veteran is entitled to special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k) for loss of use of a creative organ in addition to special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) for a total individual unemployability rating based on a single disability and additional service-connected disabilities ratable at 60 percent or more, and 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l) for aid and attendance.

SMC is available when, as the result of service connected disability, a veteran suffers additional hardships above and beyond those contemplated by VA's schedule for rating disabilities.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1114; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.352.  The rate of SMC varies according to the nature of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities.  Basic levels of SMC are listed at 38 U.S.C. §1114 (k).  Higher levels of SMC are provided at 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l), (m), (n), and (o).  SMC is payable in addition to the basic rate of compensation otherwise payable for the degree of disability.

Further, the Federal Circuit held that while the overall statutory scheme provided an overall "statutory cap," until a claimant reached such cap, the statute and regulations did not have any limit of how many qualifying disabilities a veteran can demonstrate pertaining to the intermediate rates. See Barry v. McDonough, 101 F.4th 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2024).   

The schedular rates of compensation are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (a)-(j), and the statutory rates and requirements for SMC are set forth in subsections (k)-(t).

SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) is payable if a veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of one or more creative organs, or one foot, or one hand, or both buttocks, or blindness of one eye, having only light perception, has suffered complete organic aphonia with constant inability to communicate by speech, or deafness of both ears, having absence of air and bone conduction.  The rate of compensation shall be $96 per month for each such loss or loss of use independent of any other compensation provided in subsections (a) through (j) or subsection (s) of this section but in no event to exceed $3,327 per month; and in the event the veteran has suffered one or more of the disabilities heretofore specified in this subsection, in addition to the requirement for any of the rates specified in subsections (l) through (n) of this section, the rate of compensation shall be increased by $96 per month for each such loss or loss of use, but in no event to exceed $4,667 per month.  This special compensation is payable in addition to the basic rate of compensation otherwise payable on the basis of degree of disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k), 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (a).

The Veteran is in receipt of SMC at the (s) level under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 from March 10, 2021 as a result of his total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) based solely on his posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and additional service connected disabilities of chronic headaches and chronic sinusitis rated 60 percent or more.  He is also in receipt of SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l) due to his need of regular aid and attendance from September 28, 2022.  Finally, the Veteran is in receipt of SMC under 38, U.S.C. § 1114 (k) due to loss of creative organ from April 8, 2023.

The accounting he received of his compensation payments with these awards, namely in an August 2023 Award Print spreadsheet reflects that the Veteran has been in receipt of VA disability monthly compensation, including cost of living, minor child, and SMC adjustments, in the amount of $4,708.78 beginning in December 2022. As of December 1, 2023, the payments increased to $4,859.46. 

Again, under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k), compensation payments for these SMC awards have an upper statutory cap not to exceed $4,667 per month. As such, the Board finds the Veteran was provided an accounting from the AOJ and, unlike the circumstances in Barry, he has reached the overall statutory cap, the overall limit of monetary benefits.  Cf. Barry, 101 F.4th 1348.

Also, unlike the circumstances in Barry, there is no dispute here as to whether the Veteran is free to qualify for SMC compensation under various intermediate rated (in this case, under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) due to loss of a use of a creative organ); indeed, he already has. Instead, the issue on appeal here is solely whether he can be compensated for said award.

Again, the evidence of record as indicated by his Award Print spreadsheet, reflects that the Veteran received a monthly gross payment of $4,708.78 beginning in December 2022 due to his service connection disabilities and awards of SMC as noted above, which already exceeds the statutory limit of $4,667 per month and, therefore, additional compensation for loss of use of a creative organ at a rate of $96 per month is prohibited as a matter of law.  See also Barry, 101 F.4th 1348. While the Board finds no prohibition of the Veteran being qualified for additional SMC rates, he cannot be further compensated for increased levels, to include at the increased (l), (s) plus (k) level from April 8, 2023.

In short, because his compensation already reached the overall statutory cap, the Veteran's appeal is denied as a matter of law.
