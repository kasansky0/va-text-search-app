DOCKET NO. 240729-458747
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

For the entire period on appeal, entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, particularly his diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the bilateral upper and lower extremities, rendered him unable to secure or maintain substantially gainful employment.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

For the entire period on appeal, the criteria for entitlement to TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.15, 4.16, 4.18.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service in the U.S. Air Force from January 1979 to December 1982 and from August 1985 to August 2001.

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to a TDIU most recently addressed in a March 2022 rating decision.  In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. For the entire period on appeal, entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities.

A total disability rating may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as the result of service-connected disabilities.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  Consideration may be given to a veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; see also Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85-86 (2014).

To qualify for a total rating for compensation purposes, the evidence must show: (1) a single disability rated as 100 percent disabling; or (2) that the veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disabilities and there is one disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or, if more than one disability, at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and a combined disability rating of 70 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  For the purpose of establishing one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, disabilities affecting a single body system are considered as one disability.  Id.  Disabilities that are not service connected cannot serve as a basis for a total disability rating.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.19.  

Unlike the regular disability rating schedule, which is based on the average work-related impairment caused by a disability, "entitlement to TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstance."  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009) (quoting Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 116 (2008)); see also Todd, 27 Vet. App. at 85-86.  Therefore, in adjudicating a TDIU claim, VA must consider the individual veteran's education, training, and work history.  Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164, 168 (1991) (level of education is a factor in deciding employability); see Friscia v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 294 (1994) (considering veteran's experience as a pilot, his training in business administration and computer programming, and his history of obtaining and losing 19 jobs in the previous 18 years); Beaty v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 532 (1994) (considering veteran's 8th grade education and sole occupation as a farmer); Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991) (considering veteran's master's degree in education and his part-time work as a tutor).

In determining whether a veteran can secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, attention must be given to the veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the type of activities (e.g., sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy) required by the occupation at issue.  Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the veteran's limitations, if any, concerning lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, and reaching, as well as auditory and visual limitations; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.  Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the veteran's limitations, if any, concerning memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle workplace stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity.  Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  

In the instant case, the Veteran is in receipt of a 50 percent rating for sleep apnea; a 50 percent rating for depressive disorder associated with residuals of left knee injury, with acl repair and early degenerative joint disease; a 10 percent rating for scars, right ankle s/p surgical procedure and left knee s/p ACL repair; a 10 percent rating for residuals of left knee injury, with acl repair and early degenerative joint disease; a 10 percent rating for tinnitus; and noncompensable ratings for bilateral hearing loss and  linear scars, left knee s/p acl repair associated with residuals of left knee injury, with acl repair and early degenerative joint disease. 

The Veteran has at least one disability ratable at 40 percent (sleep apnea and depressive disorder) or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Therefore, he meets the schedular requirements for TDIU.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Evidence and Analysis

As to work history, the Veteran last worked as a service technician from September 2003 to June 2022. See April 2023 private opinion. The Veteran reported that he left his job due to his inability to perform his work due to his service-connected disabilities. Id. at p. 6. The Veteran further stated that he stopped working full-time in January 2020.  He stated he only worked part-time until fully stopping work in June 2022.  See Statement in Support of Claim, April 2023. 

As to education history, the Veteran completed high school. 

In the April 2023 private opinion, the provider concluded that his service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to perform gainful employment. The examiner reasoned that the Veteran was not capable of performing substantially gainful employment in his usual vocation or in other vocations due to his physical, psychological, and cognitive disabilities related to his service-connected disabilities. Specifically, due to his ankle disability, knee disability, and degenerative arthritis, the provider noted that he had difficulty with standing, walking, running, jumping, jogging, squatting, kneeling, crawling, climbing, and sitting. Due to his hearing loss and tinnitus, he had difficulty understanding speech and conversations. Due to his depressive disorder and sleep apnea, he had difficulty with cognitive abilities such as memory, concentration, attention, and executive functions. The Board finds the April 2023 private opinion probative, as the report is based on the Veteran's statements, in-person examination, and the provider's observations. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 30205 (2008).

Given the Veteran's educational and work background and the severity of his service-connected disabilities, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively favors entitlement to TDIU for the entire period on appeal.

Specifically, as to physical limitations, in the April 2023 opinion, the private provider concluded that his service-connected ankle and knee disabilities as well as his degenerative arthritis impacted his ability to work, particularly since he had difficulty with prolonged standing, walking, running, jumping, jogging, squatting, kneeling, crawling, climbing, and sitting.  As to sedentary work, the private provider also noted that he had difficulty with sitting. Generally, the private provider also noted that he had difficulty with memory, concentration, attention, and executive functions due to his service-connected depressive disorder and sleep apnea. Given the Veteran's background, the Board does not believe that the Veteran would be able to secure a sedentary position commensurate with his work experience. 

Accordingly, entitlement to a TDIU is warranted.
