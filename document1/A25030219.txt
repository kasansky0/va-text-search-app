ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 9, 2017, for the grant of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's diabetes has required no more than an oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet for control, with no required insulin or restricted activities during the period on appeal. 

2. The Veteran's diabetic retinopathy did not manifest with documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 treatment visit during the past 12 months.

3. There was no claim prior to February 9, 2017, for service connection for diabetes mellitus type II with diabetic retinopathy. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913.

2. The criteria for an earlier effective date prior to February 9, 2017, for service connection for diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Army from October 1969 to May 1972, including service in the Republic of Vietnam. This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2017 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

A rating decision was issued under the legacy system of appeals in March 2017 and the Veteran submitted a timely notice of disagreement. The Board remanded the claims in June 2023 for additional development.  In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC). The Veteran opted the claims into the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), by submitting a March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, identifying the February 2024 SSOC.  Therefore, the February 2024 SSOC is the decision on appeal.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 SSOC. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the February 2024 SSOC, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that on February 20, 2024, the AOJ notified the Veteran of a rating decision granting service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the right upper extremity, left upper extremity, right lower extremity (sciatic nerve), left lower extremity (sciatic nerve), right lower extremity (femoral nerve), and left lower extremity (femoral nerve). The February 2024 rating decision expressly notes that the Veteran did not make any separate claims for service-connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy but subsequent to the Board's June 2023 remand, the Veteran was granted a new VA examination and the AOJ found that the issues were raised by the evidence of record. On February 20, 2025, the Veteran submitted VA form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, appealing the February 2024 assigned ratings and effective dates regarding diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Accordingly, the issues under the February 2024 rating decision and February 2025 Notice of Disagreement, will be addressed in a separate Board decision in docket order.

Effective Date

Unless specifically provided otherwise in applicable law, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application for said benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A claimant or certain other authorized individuals may indicate the claimant's desire to file a claim for benefits by filing an Intent to File form with VA. The Intent to File form must indicate the general type of benefit sought, e.g., compensation or pension, but need not identify the specific benefit or condition to be claimed. Upon receipt of that form, VA will furnish the appropriate application form. If VA receives a complete application form (claim) within one year of receipt of the Intent to File form, VA will consider the completed claim as filed as of the date the Intent to File form was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

The effective date for an increased rating for disability compensation will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred if a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim. If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Effective dates should not be assigned based solely on the date of diagnosis. Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015). Instead, all relevant facts should be considered to determine the date the increase in disability first manifested. DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 58 (2011); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Disability Ratings

VA's percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and applicable rating criteria. All reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

A separate or higher rating may be assigned based on non-overlapping conditions and symptoms, if the compensable criteria under applicable diagnostic codes are met, including with consideration of additional functional loss after repetitive use or flare-ups for musculoskeletal conditions based on range of motion. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.14, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a; Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

Separate evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. In other words, the evaluations may be staged. Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). The Board has considered the record and has found that staged ratings are not warranted in this claim; as the degree of disability has remained approximately the same throughout the period on appeal.

An unlisted condition may be rated under a closely related disease or injury in which the functions affected, and the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous. 38 C.F.R. § 4.20. Where a condition is unlisted, other potentially applicable codes will be considered to determine the most appropriate and highest rating. However, when a condition is specifically listed under a diagnostic code, it may not be rated by analogy. See id.; Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333 (2015); Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484 (2016); Scott v. Wilkie, 920 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Circ. 2019). 

All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. The Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal," and does not require that the evidence be in exact equipoise. Evidence is in approximate balance when the evidence in favor of and opposing the Veteran's claim is found to be almost exactly or nearly equal. See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021), affirmed en banc 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (exact equipoise is not required for benefit of the doubt to be applied); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy is denied.

The AOJ awarded service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, and assigned a 20 percent rating, effective since February 9, 2017. In his VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed from the initial rating assigned; however, no specific arguments have been presented as to the rating assigned under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7913, diabetes mellitus type II.

In April 2021 and again in June 2021, the Veteran's attorney submitted argument and a private vocational assessment report prepared by a certified rehabilitation counselor (CRC report). The April 2021 CRC report specifically opines that the Veteran experiences daily episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia due to his diabetes, as well as vision limitations, including blind spots, "floaters," and "blurred vision," due to his diabetic retinopathy, which is part and parcel of the present appeal. See VBMS documents titled, "Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility," receipt date 04/26/2021, and 06/07/2021.   

Under DC 7913, a 20 percent rating is assigned for diabetes requiring insulin and a restricted diet or an oral hypoglycemic agent and a restricted diet. A 40 percent rating is assigned for diabetes requiring insulin, a restricted diet, and regulation of activities. A 60 percent rating is assigned for diabetes requiring insulin, a restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring one or two hospitalizations per year or twice a month visits to a diabetic care provider, plus complications that would not be compensable if separately evaluated. A maximum 100 percent rating is assigned for diabetes requiring more than one daily injection of insulin, a restricted diet, and regulation of activities (avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities) with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring at least three hospitalizations per year or weekly visits to a diabetic care provider plus either progressive loss of weight and strength or complications that would be compensable if separately evaluated. 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, DC 7319. Note (1) states that compensable complications of diabetes will be evaluated separately unless they are part of the criteria used to support a 100 percent evaluation. Non-compensable complications are considered part of the diabetic process. Id.

Diabetic retinopathy is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.75, DC 6040. A compensable rating under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye is warranted where the disability manifests as documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 but less than 3 treatment visits for an eye condition during the prior 12 months. Compensable ratings may also be awarded on the basis of impairment of central visual acuity or impairment of visual fields. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.75, 4.76, 4.77, 4.79.

Evidence

The February 2017 VA examination was for eye conditions and was performed by a Doctor of Optometry (O.D.). The examiner made express findings that the Veteran's ocular health was within normal limits, no diabetic eye disease was noted, and opined that the Veteran's glaucoma is "not aggravated, caused by, or a result of diabetes mellitus." The February 2017 VA opinion rationale cited medical literature and medical evidence of record indicating that the Veteran's diagnosis of glaucoma predated his diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and that the two are not related. See VBMS document titled, "C&P Exam," receipt date 02/28/2017.

The March 2017, July 2020, and August 2023 VA examinations for diabetes mellitus type II included diagnoses of diabetes mellitus type II and diabetic retinopathy. The examiners concluded that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type II is treated with no more than oral hypoglycemic agents and restricted diet for control. The examinations also found that the Veteran does not require insulin injections or regulation of activities as part of managing his diabetes mellitus. The August 2023 examination noted that the Veteran had been using Ozempic injections but did not find that once weekly Ozempic injections are insulin or required more frequently than once per week. As to the diagnosis of retinopathy, the March 2017, July 2020, and August 2023 examinations did not include examinations for vision or eye conditions, do not include findings as to visual acuity or incapacitating episodes due to retinopathy, and do not indicate whether the examinations were performed by an optometrist (O.D.) or licensed ophthalmologist. See VBMS documents titled, "C&P Exam," receipt date 03/10/2017, 07/31/2020, 08/11/2023.

The September 2023 VA examination was for eye conditions and indicated that the Veteran was diagnosed with glaucoma, cataracts, and diabetic retinopathy but only his glaucoma requires treatment with eyedrops for intraocular pressure. The examination of visual acuity revealed corrected distance and near vision of 20/20 or better bilaterally and that the Veteran does not have a visual field defect, astigmatism, diplopia, anatomical loss, light perception only, extremely poor vision, or blindness. The examination also revealed that the Veteran has not experienced any incapacitating episodes in the previous 12 months and that none of his eye conditions affect his ability to work. The examiner opined that the Veteran's "non-vascular" open-angle glaucoma was diagnosed in 2016, before the Veteran was diagnosed with diabetes or retinopathy, and that diabetes does not cause and is not related to open-angle glaucoma. The examiner further explained that the type of glaucoma that is associated with diabetes is "neo-vascular." The Veteran has not been diagnosed with "neo-vascular glaucoma." In addition, the examiner opined that the Veteran's "mild cataracts" are age related and not associated with his diabetes. The examiner found that bilateral "mild diabetic retinopathy was present," but that none of the Veteran's eye conditions caused any visual field defect, decrease in visual acuity, or other visual impairment. See VBMS document titled, "C&P Exam," receipt date 09/20/2023.

The Veteran's VA treatment records reveal no more than an oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet for control, with no evidence that his diabetes ever required insulin or restricted activities. Notations from the Veteran's regular primary care health evaluations throughout the appeal period reveal that the Veteran consistently reported "no new vision problems," and "no hypoglycemic incidents." As to eye disabilities, VA treatment records include diagnoses of cataracts in both eyes in October 2014 and "primary open-angle glaucoma" in November 2014. VA treatment records are silent for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy by the Veteran's regular O.D. until October 2017, when a diabetic eye examination revealed diagnosis of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) but was noted as without diabetic eye disease and results were "normal." An August 2018 optometry evaluation assessed the Veteran's glaucoma and noted "diet controlled diabetes, no diabetic eye disease noted." In a February 2021 optometric note, the Veteran complained of blurred vision. The VA optometrist indicated that the blurred vision was due to non-compliance with the Veteran's prescription eye drop treatment for non-service-connected glaucoma and is silent for any relation or association to the Veteran's service-connected diabetic retinopathy. An August 2023 optometry evaluation assessed the Veteran's glaucoma as "manage," and diabetes as noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus "without ocular complications." 

The Board notes that beginning in July 2023, the Veteran's prescriptions included "non-VA Metformin HCL" to be taken orally, twice per day, and Ozempic, noted as "non-VA semiglutide" to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin) once per week. There is no evidence that the Veteran has required daily injection of insulin and regulation of activities at any time throughout the appeal period. See VBMS documents titled, "CAPRI," receipt date 01/05/2023 (pages 30, 31, 82, 87, 92, 113, 114, 128, 143, 146, 173, 200, 281, 283, 292, 491, 548, 609, 635, 968, 975 of 1406); and receipt date 01/02/2024 (pages 4, 26, 30, 45, 52, 91, 251, 259 of 274).

Private treatment records also reveal no more than oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet for control, with no required insulin or restricted activities. In addition, the Veteran's private treatment records include diagnoses for glaucoma and cataracts but are silent for diagnosis or complaints of symptoms due to retinopathy. In addition, the Veteran's private treatment records are silent for any evidence that any of his eye conditions cause incapacitating episodes or impairment of visual acuity or visual files See VBMS document titled, "Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility," receipt dates 07/25/2018 and 08/13/2018. 

The evidence does not suggest any complications other than the retinopathy and separately rated peripheral neuropathies.

Analysis

The Board finds that the Veteran's VA treatment records and VA examinations constitute persuasive evidence that the Veteran's service-connected diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy, required no more than an oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet for control, with no required insulin or restricted activities. The Board also finds that the Veteran's VA treatment records and VA examinations constitute persuasive evidence that the Veteran's diabetic retinopathy does not cause incapacitating episodes or cause impairment of visual acuity or visual fields.   

After thoroughly reviewing the evidence of record, throughout the appeal period, the Board finds that that the most probative evidence of record includes the VA examinations and VA treatment records because they are internally consistent, consistent with the other objective evidence of record, and include extensive medical findings supported by the Veteran's history and overall evidentiary record. 

The Board has considered the April 2021 private CRC opinion that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy causes vision limitations including blind spots in peripheral vision as well as frequent floaters and blurred vision. The Board notes that the private CRC did not opine that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type II requires one or more daily injections of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities. The CRC conducted only a records review and vocational interview with the Veteran and did not examine the Veteran or perform any diagnostic testing and there is no evidence that the CRC is, or otherwise purported to be, a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist competent to examine, diagnose, or opine on diseases and disabilities of the eye. Because 38 C.F.R. § 4.75 expressly requires examinations for visual impairment to be performed by a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist and the CRC's opinion is silent for any such license, the Board assigns no probative weight to the April 2021 CRC opinion as to severity of the Veteran's diabetic retinopathy.

Regarding the same opinion that notes daily episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia due to his diabetes, the Veteran's concurrent treatment records and examinations do not demonstrate hospitalizations for such events, such that a higher rating would be warranted.

The Board further finds that the Veteran's file is silent for any evidence that the Veteran has ever required daily injection of insulin and regulation of activities, or that the Veteran's diabetes has resulted in hospitalizations, loss of weight or strength, or required diabetic care at least twice monthly. The Board notes that the Veteran's prescription for Ozempic (semiglutide) is administered by subcutaneous injection seemingly similar to injectable insulin; however, the Veteran's VA and private treatment providers, pharmacological records, and VA examiners, have never categorized it as "insulin," and there is no evidence that the Ozempic dose was ever more frequent than one injection per week. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's prescription for Ozempic is not analogous to the daily injection of insulin contemplated by the rating criteria under DC 7913. 

The Board finds that the VA treatment records and VA examinations constitute probative evidence that the Veteran has been diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy throughout the appeal period but without any incapacitating episodes or impairment of visual field or visual acuity. While the medical evidence of record shows that the Veteran receives routine and regular optometric treatment from his VA providers, there is no evidence that the Veteran's diabetic retinopathy has caused any incapacitating episodes or impairment of visual acuity or visual field at any time during the appeal period. In addition, the evidence shows that the Veteran's VA treatment providers have expressly attributed any complaints of vision symptoms and impairments to the Veteran's non-service-connected glaucoma and cataracts. Moreover, the February 2017 VA examiner, who is noted to be the Veteran's regular treating VA doctor of optometry, and the September 2023 VA examiner expressly opined that the Veteran's glaucoma is not due to or aggravated by his diabetes. Accordingly, the Board finds that VA optometric treatment records and examinations are the only probative evidenced as to the severity of the Veteran's diabetic retinopathy throughout the appeal period and persuasively show that the Veteran's diabetic retinopathy has not resulted in any incapacitating episodes or impairment of visual field or acuity. Therefore, the Veteran is not entitled to a separate compensable rating for diabetic retinopathy under any diagnostic code. 

Based on thorough review of the evidence, the Board finds that the only probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy required no more than an oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet for control, with no required insulin or restricted activities and without incapacitating episodes or impairment of visual field or visual acuity. With no probative evidence to the contrary, the Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance and persuasively shows that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy required no more than an oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet for control, with no required insulin or restricted activities and without incapacitating episodes or impairment of visual field or visual acuity.

In summary, the criteria for a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes are not met at any point. The evidence is not in approximate balance, and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; Lynch, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021). The appeal is denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 9, 2017, for the grant of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy is denied.

In this case, the Veteran originally filed a claim for entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, on February 9, 2017. See VBMS document titled, "VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation)," receipt date 02/09/2017. In March 2017, the AOJ granted the claim and assigned a 20 percent rating for diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy effective from the date of claim, February 9, 2017. The Veteran appealed the initial assigned effective date; however, no specific arguments have been presented for this issue.

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance, will be the date VA receives the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The reference to "the date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought; this is determined on a "facts found" basis. See McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a).

There is no argument or suggestion of a claim or Intent to File prior to February 9, 2017, for service connection for diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy. There is no evidence of any pending or unadjudicated claim submitted prior to February 9, 2017. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that there is no evidence in support of the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date of the grant of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy. Because February 9, 2017, is the earliest possible effective date of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy, and the AOJ assigned that date upon granting the initial claim for service connection, an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II with retinopathy is not warranted. 

In summary, the evidence is not in approximate balance, and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; Lynch, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021). The appeal is denied.
