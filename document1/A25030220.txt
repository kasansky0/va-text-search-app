DOCKET NO. 240515-440836
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for asthma (claimed as lung condition) is granted pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act).

Service connection for rhinitis (claimed as lung condition) is granted pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act).

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, he is presumed to be exposed to environmental toxins as a result of that service, and his VA treatment records reflect a diagnosis of and treatment for asthma and rhinitis.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service-connection for asthma and rhinitis on a presumptive basis pursuant to the PACT Act have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1119, 1120, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.317, 3.320. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1997 to April 2012, including foreign service in Afghanistan and Iraq.  For his meritorious service, the Veteran was awarded (among other decorations) the Bronze Star Medal and the Army Commendation and Achievement Medals.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an April 2024 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  Given the date of this rating decision, the Veteran's appeal is governed by the modernized review system (known by the Board as AMA).  38 C.F.R. § 19.2.

On his May 2024 VA Form 10182 to the Board, the Veteran selected direct review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Service connection for asthma (claimed as lung condition) is granted

2. Service connection for rhinitis (claimed as lung condition) is granted

The Veteran asserts that he currently suffers from a lung condition that he believes is related to his active service.  After a review of the evidence and application of the governing law, the Board determines that service connection for asthma and rhinitis is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Service-connection may be warranted under the PACT Act, effective August 10, 2022, unless affirmative evidence proves otherwise, any covered veteran is presumed to have been exposed to certain substances, chemicals, and airborne hazards during their service.  A "covered veteran" means any veteran who on or after August 2, 1990, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, or United Arab Emirates; or on or after September 11, 2001, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Uzbekistan, or any other country determined relevant by the Secretary.  When a covered veteran manifests certain disease, including asthma and rhinitis, such disabilities shall be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated during active military, naval, air, or space service, notwithstanding that there is no record of evidence of such disease during the period of service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120.

In his November 2023 claim, the Veteran stated that he was seeking service connection for a "lung condition," noting that he was exposed to burn pits during his active service.  The Veteran noted that he developed a persistent cough, throat issues, and that he experiences shortness of breath.

The Veteran's VA treatment records reflect that he is diagnosed with asthma and that he is prescribed an albuterol inhaler to treat that disability.  These records also reflect that the Veteran is diagnosed as suffering from allergic rhinitis, and that he has been prescribed medication to treat that disability.  The current disability criterion is met.

Further, given the Veteran's history of service in Iraq after August 2, 1990, and Afghanistan after September 19, 2001, the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to environmental toxins.  He is thus a PACT Act covered Veteran, and his diagnosed asthma and rhinitis are presumptively related to his active service and his presumed in-service exposures.

The RO denied the Veteran's claim on the basis that a December 2023 VA examination did not find that the Veteran suffered from any particular respiratory disability.  Given the clear notations from the Veteran's VA treatment records, the Board finds that this examination has little probative value and is outweighed by the evidence reflecting current disabilities.

Accordingly, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that he is currently diagnosed as suffering from asthma and rhinitis, and that both are presumptively related to his active service.  Service connection for asthma and rhinitis is granted.

Finally, the Board has endeavored to take as broad a look at the Veteran's contentions and his medical records as possible, to find all potential disabilities that could match the symptoms described by the Veteran in his claim.  Having granted service connection for asthma and rhinitis, the Board is satisfied that it has afforded the Veteran all possible considerations in this case, reaching a positive outcome without the need for additional development or delay.
