DOCKET NO. 240617-448237

ORDER

An effective date of September 10, 2023, but no earlier, for the award of a 70 percent rating for persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress, insomnia, chronic sleep impairment, and daytime sleepiness (hereafter collectively referred to as PDD) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On September 10, 2023, VA received the Veteran's intent to file a claim for an increased rating of PDD. 

2. It is not factually ascertainable that such disability increased in severity so as to warrant a 70 percent rating within the year prior to the receipt of the intent to file a claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of September 1, 2023, but no earlier, for the award of a 70 percent disability rating for PDD are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from November 1984 to December 1988. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in January 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 17, 2023, for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for PDD. 

By way of background, the Veteran filed an original claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability, claimed as anxiety and depression, in September 2019, which was denied in a November 2019 unappealed rating decision. On July 21, 2021, the Veteran submitted an intent to file, and a supplemental claim was submitted in March 2022, again requesting service connection for anxiety and depression. The AOJ denied the Veteran's supplemental claim in an April 2022 rating decision. The Veteran appealed in June 2022, seeking higher level review of the April 2022 rating decision. However, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for anxiety and depression was, again, denied in a July 2022 rating decision. 

The Veteran submitted an intent to file on August 28, 2022, with a supplemental claim being filed in December 2022, again seeking service connection for a psychiatric disability. Service connection was granted as 50 percent disabling for persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress (PDD), effective August 28, 2022, in an April 2023, rating decision. In May 2023 the Veteran applied for higher level review, arguing that he was entitled to an earlier effective date for PDD. In an August 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted an earlier effective date of July 7, 2021, rating his PDD as 30 percent disabling from July 7, 2021, to August 27, 2022, and as 50 percent disabling thereafter from August 28, 2022. 

VA received a notice of intent to file on September 10, 2023. Then, on September 17, 2023, the Veteran filed a new claim on VA Form 21-526EZ, alleging a worsening of symptoms since the assignment of a 50 percent rating in August 2023. An increase to 70 percent was granted, effective September 17, 2023, for PDD, insomnia, chronic sleep impairment, and daytime sleepiness in a January 2024 rating decision, which, as noted above, is the subject of this appeal.

The Veteran now contends that an earlier effective date for the grant of a 70 percent rating is warranted. Specifically, the Veteran, through his attorney, argues that he is entitled to an effective date of July 1, 2019, for the increased rating of his psychiatric disability. See June 2024 Correspondence. In support thereof, the Veteran is requesting the Board consider a "good cause COVID-19 pandemic related extension" and find the July 7, 2021, was filed timely (i.e., within a year of the September 2019 rating decision denying service connection) so as to constitute continuous pursuit of the claim. Id.

While not cited specifically, the Board believes the Veteran's attorney is referring to the Veterans Benefits Administration's Policy Letter 20-02 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). In general, Policy Letter 20-02 provided that the COVID-19 global pandemic was considered a good-cause basis for VA to grant extensions of time limits to submit certain documents and responses. Policy Letter 20-02 advised that effective March 1, 2020, if a claimant or a claimant's authorized representative requested an extension of a time limit associated with a required action based on the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, the filing of a response to a proposed adverse action, VA would grant the request under the good cause provisions, provided the time limit would have expired or situation occurred on or after March 1, 2020.

Claimants were advised to request an extension for filing due to COVID-19 on their filing submission or attach the request as a separate document, noting specifically that they were requesting an extension of the time because of COVID-19, (or any related reference to COVID-19, the coronavirus, national pandemic, or similar language). Policy Letter 20-02 stated that the guidance was effective during the period of March 1, 2020, through 60 calendar days following the date the President ends the national emergency.

On April 10, 2023, Public Law 118-3 was signed, which terminated the national COVID-19 outbreak emergency. This makes June 9, 2023, 60 calendar days following the date the president ended the national emergency, the end date of VBA's temporary claims and appeal processing guidance. Specifically, the temporary procedures and guidance outlined in Policy Letter 20-02 related to requests for time limit extensions, evidence submission, and requests to reschedule a hearing or examination expired at the end of the day on June 9, 2023. Here, the representative made the argument for an extension in June 2024, far beyond the deadline to do so, and thus this argument is unpersuasive.

Further, the Veteran was awarded service connection in an April 2023 rating decision. He challenged the assigned rating by requesting a higher-level review, which was completed and assigned an earlier effective date in an August 2023 decision. The Veteran did not continue to challenge or appeal the assigned effective date thereafter. Accordingly, any argument for an earlier effective date for the award of service connection herein is improper as it amounts to a free-standing earlier effective date claim. Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006) (appellants are prohibited from collaterally attacking a prior final rating decision by filing a freestanding earlier effective date claim).

Additionally, in his June 2024 correspondence, the Veteran's attorney makes an argument for an increased rating based on the Veteran's symptomatology. See June 2024 Correspondence. The laws and regulations pertaining to increased ratings are separate and distinct from those pertaining to earlier effective dates. And, notably, there is a concurrent appeal at the Board addressing whether the Veteran is entitled to ratings in excess of 30 percent for the period beginning July 7, 2021, and ending August 27, 2022, in excess of 50 percent for the period beginning August 28, 2022, and ending September 16, 2023, and in excess of 70 percent from September 17, 2023, thereafter. Therefore, the Board is limiting its discussion to the propriety of an earlier effective date for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for PDD, insomnia, chronic sleep impairment, and daytime sleepiness.

After a thorough review of the record, the Board has determined that an effective date of September 10, 2023, the date the VA received the Veteran's intent to file, but no earlier, is warranted for the assignment of a 70 percent rating of the Veteran's service-connected anxiety disorder.

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of a claim for increase in disability shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claim for increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 38 U.S.C. §5110(b)(3) provides an exception to this general rule: "The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date." See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); also see Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

A "claim" for VA compensation purposes means a "written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). A claimant may preserve an earlier effective date by indicating their desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). Generally, if a formal application for benefits is received within a year of an intent to file a claim, the date of claim for effective date purpose is the date the intent to file was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii).

Thus, determining whether an effective date assigned for an increased rating is correct or proper under the law requires (1) a determination of the date of the receipt of the claim for the increased rating as well as (2) a review of all the evidence of record to determine when an increase in disability was ascertainable.

Initially, as above, the current appeal arises from a VA Form 21-526EZ for an increased rating of his psychiatric disability received on September 17, 2023. However, within a year prior to that claim, on September 10, 2023, VA received an intent to file a claim. Thus, this intent is considered filed in connection with the September 17, 2023, claim, the date of claim is September 10, 2023. Prior to that date, and following the grant of service connection, in May 2023 the Veteran filed a request for a higher-level review of the assigned effective date and rating. The higher-level review decision was issued in August 2023, and the Veteran separately followed an appeal of that decision. There are no other filings that could be interpreted as a claim for increased ratings for PDD other than the September 2023 claim. Thus, September 10, 2023, is the earliest date of claim for the current appeal.

Notably, the continuous pursuit provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1) do not apply to new claims filed within the appeal period after a rating decision. Rather, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1) require the filing of an available review option under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). Here, the Veteran did not seek review of the January 2023 rating decision, or the initial rating assigned for the Veteran's psychiatric disorder, but instead filed a new claim via the filing of a VA 21-526 EZ.

The Court has recognized and upheld the important distinctions between the AMA VA Forms, such as the supplemental claim (filed on a VA Form 20-0995) and a "new" claim (filed on a VA Form 21-526EZ). See Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277, 281 (2024) (holding that a new claim is distinct from a supplemental claim and, therefore, cannot be considered "continuous pursuit" for purposes of effective dates or for purposes of attorney fees); Cf. Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (March 13, 2025) (finding a VA Form 21-8940 could be interpreted as a supplemental claim). Here, the Veteran was represented by an attorney, could have filed a supplemental claim, but chose to file a new claim.

The Board must next determine whether the increase in disability was factually ascertainable within the year prior to the Veteran's September 10, 2023, intent to file, and, if it was, the date entitlement to the 70 percent rating arose. This analysis necessarily contemplates part of the same period as a concurrent Board decision regarding entitlement to an increased rating.

Prior to the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, which increased the Veteran's psychiatric to 70 percent disabling, the Veteran's psychiatric disability was evaluated as 50 percent disabling pursuant to DC 9411, which provides ratings under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders at 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. 

In this regard, a 50 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment, impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. Id.

A 70 percent rating is warranted where there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id.

A 100 percent evaluation is assigned where there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Id.

The Court has held that the evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 is "symptom-driven," meaning that "symptomatology should be the fact-finder's primary focus when deciding entitlement to a given disability rating" under that regulation. See Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 116-117 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The symptoms listed are not exhaustive, but rather "serve as examples of the type and degree of symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating." Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). In the context of determining whether a higher disability evaluation is warranted, the analysis requires considering "not only the presence of certain symptoms, but also that those symptoms have caused occupational and social impairment in most of the referenced areas" i.e., "the regulation requires an ultimate factual conclusion as to the Veteran's level of impairment in most areas." Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 117-118; 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.

Further, when evaluating a mental disorder, the Board must consider the "frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission," and must also "assign an evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination." 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(a).

Turning to the evidence of record pertinent to the one-year look-back period, the Veteran began received treatment for his psychiatric disability at the Gainesville VA Medical Center (VAMC) in September and October of 2022. The Veteran's symptoms varied month to month but were consistently considered "moderate" in terms of anxiety and depression during the year prior to the filing of a claim for an increased disability rating. See September 2022 and October 2022 VA Treatment Record. Importantly, the Veteran actually reported improvements in his ability to focus and in his overall mental health, specifically noting that he was "doing better." Id.

In December 2022 the Veteran had a video interview with a private licensed psychologist, C.M. in relation to a December 2022 claim for an increased rating for his psychiatric disability. At the interview the Veteran endorsed experiencing near continuous depression, poor appetite, insomnia, low energy and fatigue, low self-esteem, poor concentration, feelings of hopelessness, diminished interests, suicidal ideation, excessive anxiety and worry, feeling on edge, muscle tension, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, mild memory loss, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances (including work), and impaired impulse control. C.M. indicated that these symptoms cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment thinking or mood. See December 2022 Private Medical Opinion. 

In January 2023, the Veteran underwent another VA examination, wherein the examiner found that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation. Assessed symptoms included depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work. 

Specifically, the record reflects that, in the year preceding the filing of the claim for an increased rating, the Veteran has maintained relationships with his spouse, children, and some friends. In this regard, the Veteran has been married for approximately twenty years and indicated that his relationship with his wife actually improved in the year prior to requesting an increase in his disability rating. See January 2023 VA Examination. He has likewise maintained relationships with his children and friends from high school, who he reportedly calls and texts regularly. Id. 

The Veteran has maintained long-term employment through the year-long review period. See January 2023 VA Examination; see also September 2022 and October 2022 VA Treatment Records. Although the Veteran contends that his job has become increasingly stressful, he has maintained employment as a high school teacher since 2009. Id. In fact, he took on additional work responsibilities by accepting a position to work during the summer, even after taking 2 weeks off from work "due to increased anxiety." See May 2023 VA Treatment Record. As relevant to working relationships, the Veteran has reported that he has no interest in making friends at work. See January 2023 VA Examination. Nevertheless, he reports appropriate relationships with supervisors. And, although he oftentimes disagrees with administration, he indicated that he "does not get into arguments with people at work." Id. He reports missing work but attributed that to the need to go to medical appointments. Id. 

Additionally, the Veteran noted that he participates in activities outside of the home. These include running errands, like going grocery shopping, fishing, going to the movies, and visiting parks. He also remained active by coaching community sports, high school sports teams, and walking a mile to a mile and one half at least three times a week. The Veteran has reported enjoying listening to jazz music and using it as a mechanism to cope with the symptoms of his psychiatric disability. See January 2023 VA Examination. 

He reported he has to "write notes for himself" to remember things. See December 2022 Private Examination. Notably, he has consistently been able to provide his own detailed history, and he has not been found to be an inaccurate historian. The January 2023 VA Examiner noted that he followed his instructions well, without the need for repetition. See January 2023 VA Examination. Furthermore, the Veteran has consistently been assessed to able to manage his personal affairs, including his own finances. This memory loss appears to be consistent with the record as whole before, during, and after the period on appeal, and does not indicate a worsening.

The Veteran reported experiencing panic attacks at a December 2022 private examination, indicating that he had been hospitalized "a month prior" for one. See December 2022 Private Examination. However, the Veteran did not report experiencing any panic attacks at the January 2023 VA examination. VA treatment records do not otherwise indicate that the Veteran was experiencing panic attacks. See September 2022 and October 2022 VA Treatment Records. Thus, while his higher rating was in part based on findings of near continuous panic or depression from a November 2023 VA examination, it is not clear form these contradicting records that his disability actually worsened in the year prior to his claim.

The Veteran's psychiatric disability symptoms have been fluid; they regularly changed in type, frequency, duration, and severity. While these symptoms affect his occupational and social functioning, he nonetheless maintains friendships and familial relations, and he has the focus and ability to maintain long-term employment working with children. It is not factually ascertainable that his psychiatric disability worsened in the year prior to the filing of the Veteran's claim for an increased rating. Rather, he has consistently reported waxing and waning symptoms since prior to his grant of service connection. The disparate findings from the private evaluation and VA examination, along with his trouble at work and contradictory assumption of more duties and activities, shows his disability naturally fluctuates, and a factually ascertainable worsening is not ascertainable.

Accordingly, the appropriate effective date for the assignment of a 70 percent rating is the date the VA received the Veteran's intent to a file a claim, or September 10, 2023. 38 U.S.C. § 501, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400. Therefore, an effective of September 10, 2023, but no earlier, for the assignment of a 70 percent disability rating is warranted.
