DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an annual clothing allowance for calendar year 2020 for the Veteran's use of a hinged left knee brace, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt for the Veteran, his left knee metal hinged brace has been reasonably shown to have caused wear and tear to his outer garments during calendar year 2020.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an annual clothing allowance for calendar year 2020 for the use of a hinged left knee brace is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1162, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.810.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from April 1983 to April 1989, and from April 1989 to October 1992.  See DD 214.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2020 administrative decision of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). 

In the September 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Clothing Allowance for fiscal year 2020

The Veteran contends that he warrants a clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year.  See September 2020 VA Form 10182.

The Veteran's claim for a clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year was denied in a July 2020 VHA decision because it determined that his type of knee and ankle braces did cause wear and tear to clothing.  See July 2020 VHA Decision.

The law provides for payment of an annual clothing allowance for each veteran who, because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including a wheelchair) which VA determines tends to wear out or tear the clothing of the veteran or uses medication which a physician has prescribed for a skin condition which is due to a service-connected disability and VA determines causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer garments. 38 U.S.C. § 1162.

The implementing regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.810, provides, in pertinent part, that an annual clothing allowance may be granted when the Under Secretary for Health or a designee certifies that a veteran, because of a service-connected disability or disabilities, wears or uses one qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair) which tends to wear or tear clothing, or that a veteran uses medication prescribed by a physician for one skin condition, which is due to a service-connected disability, that causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer garments. 38 C.F.R. § 3.810 (a)(1)(ii).

A veteran is entitled to an annual clothing allowance for each such prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair) or medication used by the veteran if each appliance or medication affects a distinct type of article of clothing or outer garment. 38 C.F.R. § 3.810 (a)(2).

A veteran is entitled to two annual clothing allowances if a veteran uses more than one such prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair), medication for more than one skin condition, or an appliance and a medication, and the appliance(s) or medication(s) together tend to wear or tear a single type of article of clothing or irreparably damage a type of outer garment at an increased rate of damage to the clothing or outer garment due to a second appliance or medication. 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(3).

Annual clothing allowance payments for those meeting the eligibility requirements become due on the August 1 anniversary date following the date on which such requirements are met, both as to initial claims and recurring payments under previously established entitlement. 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(b).

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107.  If the positive and negative evidence is evenly or approximately balanced, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another, is the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine not for application).

Application

The Veteran applied for two clothing allowances in the 2020 calendar year for a left knee brace and a left ankle or foot brace.  See VHA File, pg. 4 (containing a VA Form 10-8678, dated July 30, 2020). 

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran is service connected for left hip degenerative arthritis associated with left knee patellar chondromalacia with patellar tendonitis and meniscus tear at 30 percent disabling from February 2016, and 50 precent disabling from August 2020; left hip degenerative arthritis with limited flexion at 30 percent disabling from November 13, 2013, to December 23, 2014, and 20 percent disabling from February 14, 2012; left knee patellar chondromalacia with patellar tendonitis and meniscus tear at 20 percent disabling from June 1, 2018; left knee patellar pain syndrome at 10 percent disabling from May 15, 2018; right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome associated with left knee disorder, at 10 percent disabling from July 12, 2011; left hip scar at 10 percent disabling from August 11, 2020; epistaxis at 0 percent disabling; lipoma at 0 percent disabling from October 14, 1992; headaches at 0 percent disabling from October 14, 1992; left hip arthritis limited flexion from o percent disabling from February 14, 2012, to December 23, 2014; and left knee scar at 0 percent disabling from August 13, 2018.   See August 2022 Rating Decision Code Sheet; see also June 2020 Rating Decision Code Sheet.

While the Veteran's application for a clothing allowance indicated he requested a clothing allowance for a knee brace, and an ankle brace, the Veteran is not service connected for an ankle condition.  The Board cannot grant a clothing allowance for an ankle condition as a matter of law.  Therefore, the Board will address a clothing allowance for a left knee brace.

Regarding a knee brace, the Veteran was prescribed braces for his left and right knees.  See Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Treatment Records (CAPRI), received October 11, 2014, pg. 108 (containing Orthopedic notes which discuss prescribed knee braces).  He requested a clothing allowance for a left knee metal hinged brace.  See VHA Clothing Allowance File, pg. 4 (containing a VA Form 10-8678 Application for an Annual Clothing Allowance). 

Therefore, the Board finds the Veteran was prescribed a knee brace for a service- connected left knee disorder.   The question for the Board is whether his knee brace caused wear and tear to his clothing.   

The AOJ decision which denied the Veteran's claim indicated that his knee and ankle brace did not cause wear and tear to his clothing.    However, the decision did not provide an explanation as to why these braces do not cause wear and tear to clothing, except to cite to the VHA Handbook.  See VHA Clothing Allowance File, received January 24, 2025, pg. 6 (containing conclusory statement regarding a left knee brace . . . the item/s do/does not tend to tear and wear clothing.  VHA Handbook 1173.15").  The decision indicates that no favorable findings were found.  See id.  However, the Veteran is service connected for a knee disorder and has been prescribed a knee brace, which are considered favorable findings.

The Board considered remand to provide an adequate notice of decision under 38 U.S.C. 5104(b), to provide a clearer rationale as to why his knee brace does not cause wear and tear, and to include favorable findings.   Without adequate notice of the basis for the denial, a claimant cannot make an informed decision as to whether to accept or appeal the decision nor can they know what evidence to submit to substantiate the appeal.  38 U.S.C. 5104(b); see also Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 252 (2007) (discussing the legislative history of 38 U.S.C. § 5104 and the importance of clear and informative notice of decisions).  However, the Board finds there is adequate evidence with which to decide the claim.

The Board notes that the record indicates that he is still using his knee brace.  The record also indicates that he has received a clothing allowance in each calendar year from 2009 through 2017.  See August 2020 Award Print, Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) Compensation and Award, pg. 2.  While past awards of clothing allowances are not binding on the Board, it is still probative as to the claim at hand as the award of a clothing allowance is via experts of the prosthetics department.  Therefore, the Board finds the evidence at least evenly balanced as to whether a clothing allowance is warranted for 2020.  Thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine applies.  See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.  Resolving reasonable doubt for the Veteran, the Board finds that his left knee brace tended to cause wear and tear to his clothing.  Accordingly, entitlement to an annual clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for a left knee brace, is granted.
