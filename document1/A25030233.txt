ORDER

Entitlement to readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for asthma based on receipt of new and relevant evidence is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for asthma is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

New evidence that is relevant to the claim of entitlement to service connection for asthma has been received since the December 2018 denial of service connection.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for readjudicating the claim for entitlement to service connection for asthma are met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501(a)(1).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1983 to May 1984.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) July 2024 rating decision.

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2024 decision.  In July 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2024 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 decision. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for asthma, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (U.S. 2024), due to the possibility of a docket switch, the Board cannot adjudicate an appeal until after one year from the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal, or 60 days from the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever is later. However, as the service connection claim is being remanded for additional development, there is no prejudice to the Veteran.

Entitlement to readjudication of the claim based on new and relevant evidence is granted.

In general, rating decisions that are not appealed in the prescribed time period are final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103. However, VA will readjudicate a previously denied claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 U.S.C. § 5108 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d). New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.

Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim and includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1).

The Veteran contends that he submitted evidence with his claim and supplemental claim to readjudicate a claim of entitlement to service connection for asthma that is new and relevant.  See January 2024 VA 21-526 claim, January 2024 VA 21-10210 lay witness statement, and February 2024 VA 20-0995 supplemental claim.

Following a review of the record, and as discussed further below, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has been received and, therefore, readjudication of the appellant's claim is warranted.

Pertinent evidence received since the December 2018 rating decision consists of a January 2024 lay statement by the Veteran describing the onset of asthma symptoms due to gas chamber training exercises and the flareup of asthma symptoms during physical exercise during service.  See January 2024 VA 21-10210 lay witness statement.  Additionally, VA treatment records were received by the AOJ reflecting the Veteran's reporting of a history of asthma and a diagnosis of an asthma disability.   See September 2023 VA treatment records. Hence, such evidence is new (as it was not of record at the time of the final December 2018 rating decision) and tends to prove or disprove whether the Veteran's asthma is etiologically related to his service. Therefore, it is relevant.

In light of the foregoing, entitlement to readjudication of the claim based on new and relevant evidence is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for asthma is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he developed asthma during service by exposure to gas during training when he was required to remove his gas mask inside a military gas chamber.  The Veteran indicates that he developed coughing and difficulty breathing after his gas chamber exposure and that his asthma would flare up during running and physical activity during service.  See January 2024 VA 21-10210 lay witness statement and January 2024 VA 21-526 claim.

Service connection requires evidence of three elements: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Under the AMA, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. See 38 C.F.R. §20.802(a).

VA has a duty to assist a claimant in the development of a claim. This duty includes assisting the claimant in the procurement of relevant treatment records and providing an examination when necessary. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

VA is obligated to provide an examination or obtain a medical opinion in a claim of service connection when the record contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability or signs and symptoms of a current disability, the record indicates that the disability or signs and symptoms of disability may be associated with active service, and the record does not contain sufficient information to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). 

The Board notes that the RO made a favorable finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with an asthma disability. See July 2024 and April 2024 rating decisions. The Board is bound by this favorable finding absent a finding of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for asthma due to a lack of a nexus between the claimed conditions and active-duty service.  Additionally, the AOJ noted that the Veteran's service treatment records (STR's) were not received into the record. See July 2024 rating decision.  

The Board finds that there were pre-decisional failures in the VA's duty to assist in this case. 

The Board also notes that one of the rationales for the AOJ's denial of the Veteran's claims was that the Veteran did "not report asthma from service to the present and the evidence fails to raise the possibility the current asthma is related to military service." However, the Veteran reports his claimed injuries occurred during service after being exposed to gas during gas chamber training.  And the AOJ has reported that the VA has not been able to obtain the Veteran's STR's.

The record reflects that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination for his asthma disability. Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds a VA examination and medical opinion are necessary to properly determine entitlement to service connection. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006). The AOJ's failure to afford the Veteran a VA examination and obtain a medical opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error, especially in light of the unavailability of the Veteran's service records. Therefore, the Board finds a remand is warranted for correction of such by affording the Veteran an appropriate examination and medical opinion. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1.  Schedule the Veteran for a medical examination and obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine whether the Veteran's asthma disability is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) had its onset in, is caused by, or is otherwise related to the Veteran's military service.

A full rationale must be provided for all medical opinions provided.
