DOCKET NO. 230915-376909
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to special monthly compensation based on the need for the regular aid and attendance of another person is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

As the Board already adjudicated the matter on appeal under a different docket number (230925-379002), there remains no case or controversy before the Board to address in docket number 230915-376909.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the instant appeal pertaining to the claim of entitlement to special monthly compensation based on the need for the regular aid and attendance of another person have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 1972 to October 1980.  

In the September 15, 2023, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 15, 2023, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Dismissed Claim

Entitlement to special monthly compensation based on the need for the regular aid and attendance of another person

The August 2023 rating decision implemented the August 2023 Board decision that granted entitlement to service connection to residuals of traumatic brain injury.  A noncompensable disability rating was assigned effective December 31, 2009.  A September 2023 rating decision continued the noncompensable disability rating.  

On September 15, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 listing in specific issues: "Entitlement to SMC(l) for residuals of traumatic brain injury" and "Entitlement to SMC(t) for residuals of traumatic brain injury."  In the field for date of decision, September 13, 2023, was listed.  This is the date of the notification letter for the September 2023 rating decision continuing the noncompensable disability rating for the Veteran's TBI.  

Under docket number 230925-379002, the Board has issued a decision in March 2025 arising from a September 2022 VA Form 10182, which also addressed the Veteran's claims of entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance claimed in the instant VA Form 10182.  The Board noted that during the pendency of the appeal, a February 2024 rating decision was issued which awarded SMC based on the need for aid and attendance, which constituted a complete grant of the benefit being sought.  Moreover, the Board in its March 2025 decision found that the Veteran identified a date on which no relevant rating decision or notification letter was issued related to entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance.  On this basis, the Board determined the September 2023 VA Form 10182 was invalid. 

Later in March 2025, the Board addressed the issues of entitlement to an earlier effective date for SMC(l), to include SMC(t) based on residuals of traumatic brain injury (TBI), under docket number 230713-361179.  By that decision, the Board determined that SMC(t) was not explicitly denied by the September 2022 rating decision on appeal; however, it was reasonably raised by the record as a theory of entitlement that should be addressed.  Accordingly, the Board found the theory of entitlement to SMC(t) benefits were inextricably intertwined with the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for SMC(l) benefits and remanded the claims for further development.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board did not have jurisdiction over the matter.

Here, the Board finds dismissal of the current appeal is appropriate.  The Board already addressed the issue of entitlement to SMC based on the need for the regular aid and attendance of another person appealed from the September 2023 VA Form 10182 in its decision under docket number 230925-379002.  There remains no questions or fact or law for the Board to address.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; see also Grantham v. Brown,114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (noting that a grant of service connection extinguishes appeals before the Board).

To the extent that the Veteran is seeking an increased rating for a traumatic brain injury by expressly claiming entitlement to SMC, the Board notes that the Veteran later expressly appealed the matter in a different VA Form 10182 submitted on April 8, 2024, which is in appellate status before the Board under docket number 240408-430908.  

As there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration, the Board does not have jurisdiction over these issues.  Therefore, the appeal is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.
