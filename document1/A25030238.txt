ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.  

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have a current hearing loss disability in either ear.   

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran was a member of the United States Air Force Reserve, which service included a period of active duty from July 2003 to November 2003.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 Higher Level Review (HLR) rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which, in pertinent part, denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  The Veteran was notified of the decision and his review options in a letter dated August 28, 2023.  On August 6, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).

By way of history, in a February 2023 rating decision, the RO, in pertinent part, denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  In May 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review (HLR) seeking review of the February 2023 rating decision denying service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  In the August 2023 HLR rating decision discussed above, the RO denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  

On August 6, 2024, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182 on which he identified the February 2023 rating decision denying service connection for bilateral hearing loss and elected the Direct Review docket.  Because the VA Form 10182 was received over one year after notification of the February 2023 rating decision, and no good cause was provided or is shown by the record, it is untimely as to that rating decision.  Liberally construing the VA Form 10182 filed by this unrepresented Veteran, however, the Board finds it timely as to the August 2023 HLR rating decision denying service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  The evidentiary records would be the same, as the issue decided in August 2023 relied on the same evidentiary record used in the February 2023 decision.  

Given this procedural history, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the February 2023 rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that although the Veteran's August 2024 VA Form 10182 also identified issues of service connection for back pain and knee pain, those issues are not before the Board in this appeal.  By way of history, in the February 2023 rating decision, the RO also denied service connection for knee pain and back pain.  In May 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request:  Higher-Level Review (HLR), identifying the February 2023 rating decision and the issues of service connection for knee pain and back pain.  In an August 2023 HLR rating decision, the RO identified a duty to assist error in the denials of service connection for a knee pain and back pain and referred those issues for additional development.   In a July 2024 rating decision, after conducting additional development to correct the duty to assist errors, the RO denied service connection for a knee disability and a back disability.  The Veteran was notified of this decision and his review options in a letter dated August 2, 2024.  

On August 2, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request:  Higher Level Review, identified the August 2024 HLR rating decision and the issues as service connection for a knee disability and a back disability.  

Thereafter, on August 6, 2024, well after expiration of the appeal period for the February 2023 rating decision, the Board received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) from the Veteran on which he identified the February 2023 rating decision and the issues of service connection for back pain and knee pain.

As the Veteran's August 2024 request for HLR was received first and was not properly withdrawn, the subsequent August 20204 VA Form 10182 is an impermissible concurrent election because only one review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue.  Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 25-26 (2023); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

Moreover, even if the Board were disregard the August 2024 HLR request, the August 2024 VA Form 10182 was received more that one year after the February 2023 rating decision it attempts to appeal and good cause for an extension was not provided nor is it shown by the record.  For these reasons, the issues of service connection for back pain and knee pain are not before the Board.  

The Board notes, however, that in a November 2024 rating decision issued in response to the Veteran's August 2024 request for HLR, the RO denied service connection for back and knee disabilities.  As explained in the November 2024 notification letter, the Veteran has one year from the date of that notice to file a Notice of Disagreement or Supplemental Claim as to the issues of service connection for back and knee disabilities.  

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  

The Veteran contends that he has bilateral hearing loss as a result of noise exposure while performing his duties as an Air Transportation specialist.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current bilateral hearing loss disability and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

In pertinent part, the record on appeal shows that on authorized audiological evaluation in January 2023, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 25	 20	 25	 35	 35

LEFT	 20	 25	 25	 35	 35

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 100 percent in the right ear and of 100 percent in the left ear.

There is no other probative evidence of record documenting the presence of a current hearing loss disability which meets the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  That regulation dictates that service connection may not be established for disability due to impaired hearing unless the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory threshold for at least three of the frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.

The Veteran's right and left ear speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test were not below 94 percent on authorized audiogram.  Moreover, no frequency within the ranges covered by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 had an auditory threshold of greater than 35 decibels; and the auditory threshold for at least three frequencies was not 26 decibels or greater in either ear.  There is no other probative evidence establishing a current right or left ear hearing loss disability for VA purposes.  Accordingly, the Veteran does not meet the criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 to have right or left ear hearing loss for VA compensation purposes at this time. 

The Veteran's service treatment records do not include any recent audiological testing.  

The Board has also considered the Veteran's statements to the effect that he experiences diminished hearing acuity.  Although he is competent to describe symptoms of difficulty hearing, he is not competent to state that his right or left ear hearing acuity is severe enough to meet the specific criteria set forth in section 3.385.  This requires specific measurements as recorded on an audiometric test.  Under these circumstances, entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss must be denied because the most probative evidence shows that the Veteran does not currently have a right or left ear hearing loss disability for VA purposes.

The Board has also considered whether subjective reports of hearing loss alone are sufficient to warrant finding there is a hearing loss disability.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-69 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity.").  The Board finds, however, that the holding in Saunders is inapplicable, as VA regulations specifically define hearing loss as a disability only when certain measurements of reduced hearing acuity are met.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385; Martinez-Boden v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393 (2020) (holding that the Saunders definition of a "disability" is constrained, and the Court lacks the jurisdiction to review, the Secretary's specific determination of what constitutes a disability in the Rating Schedule).  38 C.F.R. § 3.385 is very clear in its criteria for what constitutes a hearing loss disability for VA purposes.  In this case, based on the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 decision, the Veteran does not meet the criteria.  

After reviewing all the evidence of record, it persuasively shows that the Veteran does not have a current hearing loss disability for VA purposes in either ear.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Again, absent probative evidence of a current right or left ear hearing loss disability, the claim must be denied.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  As the evidence is not in approximate balance and is persuasively against the claim, the benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
