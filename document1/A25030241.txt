ORDER

The appeal of a proposed reduction in disability rating for prostate cancer from 100 percent to 40 percent, is dismissed as a matter of law.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement with a July 2024 rating decision that proposed a reduction in disability rating for prostate cancer from 100 percent to 40 percent is not a final action of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

As there is no final agency action in the rating decision on appeal with regarding to the issue of reduction in disability rating for prostate cancer, the criteria for dismissal as a matter of law are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1972 to August 1975.

Dismissal

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a non-final July 2024 rating decision indicating a proposed rating reduction for prostate cancer.  The Veteran timely appealed the July 2024 rating decision by submitting the July 2024 VA Form 10182.

The July 2024 rating decision, however, is not a final agency action.  Rather, a rating decision merely noting a proposed agency action (in this case a proposed reduction of the disability rating assigned for the Veteran's prostate cancer from 100 percent to 40 percent) is not binding on the agency and does not change the Veteran's level of compensation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105; see also Majeed v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 421, 433-34 (2002).

Upon issuing the July 2024 rating decision, the Veteran had 60 days to provide evidence as to why the change should not be made.  Thereafter, the AOJ would issue a final decision.  The Veteran prematurely appealed the proposed rating decision, which did not include any final, binding agency action.  As such, the appeal must be dismissed as there is no final rating decision at present.  See Hargrove v. Shinseki, 629 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (affirming a dismissal of a writ recognizing the VBA decision proposing a reduction was not a final decision and the Veteran had not yet exhausted administrative remedies).

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d)(5).  As this matter is not ripe for appellate consideration, the claim must be dismissed.

Parenthetically, the AOJ issued a November 2024 rating decision, which in fact decreased the rating for prostate cancer from 100 percent to 40 percent, as relevant here, and the Veteran timely appealed that decision via a November 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  The Board has since docketed that appeal and will address it in a separate decision.
