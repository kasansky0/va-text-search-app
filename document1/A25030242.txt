ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's bilateral hearing was not shown as chronic in service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; continuity of symptomatology is not established; and the disability is not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease, to include in-service noise exposure. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing have not been met.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, 1131, 1137, 5103, 5103A, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1980 to April 1982.

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a March 2024 decision.  In July 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2024 decision.  In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss

The Veteran contends that his current bilateral hearing loss is due to in-service noise exposure.  The AOJ made the following favorable findings: noise exposure is conceded based on military occupational specialty (MOS) 45L Artillery Repairer; participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded; and bilateral hearing loss has been diagnosed.  These findings are binding on the Board.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, including bilateral hearing loss, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic (reliably diagnosed) in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

The initial question for the Board is whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was noted as chronic in service, manifested to a compensable degree in service or within the applicable presumptive period, or whether continuity of symptomatology has existed since service.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was not shown as chronic in service or within a presumptive period, did not manifest to a compensable degree within a presumptive period, and was not noted in service with attributable continuity of symptomatology.  Service treatment records are silent with respect to any complaints, finding or diagnosis of hearing loss.  The Veteran underwent a service examination in August 1984, over two years after his discharge from service, which showed normal hearing.  Importantly, the Veteran expressly denied hearing loss in his contemporaneous medical history.  Post-service records do not document any reports of decreased hearing until he filed his current claim in October 2023, decades after his separation from service and outside of the applicable presumptive period.  Importantly, the first medical evidence that the Veteran met the criteria for impaired hearing for VA purposes was the February 2024 VA examination.  

Although the Veteran is competent to report experiencing symptoms of hearing loss since service, the Board finds the reports of continuity of symptomatology not credible.  The Veteran's reports are internally inconsistent to his reports in contemporaneous treatment records, which show that he denied experiencing hearing loss two years post-service.  There are no post-service medical records documenting hearing loss.  As in this case, the absence of post-service findings, diagnosis, or treatment for many years after service is one factor that tends to weigh against a finding of continuous symptoms after service separation.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006). 

Importantly, the Board does not find that the Veteran's lay statements lack credibility merely because they are unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Rather, the current lay statements are found to lack credibility because they are inconsistent with and directly contradicted by other lay and medical evidence of record, including the Veteran's own statements in Reports of Medical History in 1984.  See Madden, 125 F.3d at 1481 ; Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 512 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

In sum, there is no competent and credible lay or medical evidence showing pertinent symptomatology since active service.  Thus, service connection is not warranted on a presumptive basis. 

The Board gives more probative weight to competent medical evidence, including the February 2024 VA examination, which establishes that there was no significant threshold shift in service and determined that the Veteran's hearing loss was not due to in-service noise exposure.  The examiner offered a detailed rationale for this finding, which is discussed further below.  

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss may still be granted on a direct basis; however, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that a medical nexus exists between the Veteran's hearing loss and an in-service injury, event or disease, to include his inservice noise exposure.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  

Again, the February 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was not at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, including reported inservice noise exposure.  The examiner rationalized that no entrance examination found with results obtained or separation examination found within 90 days.  However, examination in August 1984 (2 years post-separation) revealed normal hearing bilaterally.  Although noise exposure is conceded and the relationship between noise, auditory damage and hearing loss is well documented, auditory damage and hearing loss are not conceded based on noise alone.  There is no evidence to support a nexus to relate current hearing loss to military noise and not another etiology.  Therefore, it is less likely as not that the current hearing loss is related to military noise exposure.  

Further, as the Veteran participated in toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), he was afforded a VA examination under the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act). 38 U.S.C. § 1119.  The March 2024 VA examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity(ies), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.  To summarize, the examiner rationalized that there is no data to support any TERA causing late onset disorders of the auditory system.  The Veteran's current hearing loss was first documented at the February 2024 VA examination more than 20 years post separation from active duty.  While the Veteran has a diagnosis of hearing loss, after a thorough review of medical literature, there is no medical evidence or objective evidence found in the claims file to support a relationship between toxic exposure risk activities and diagnosis of hearing loss.  The Veteran claims lead exposure as a result of his MOS Artillery Repairer.  Lead is not known to cause hearing loss immediately or late onset from exposure.

Taken together, the VA opinions are probative because they are based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

Although the Veteran believes his bilateral hearing loss is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, including reported inservice noise exposure, he is not competent to provide a nexus opinion in this case.  This issue is also medically complex, as it requires specialized medical knowledge and the ability to interpret audiogram findings.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the February and March 2024 VA medical opinions.

For all the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss must be denied.  In reaching the conclusion to deny each claim, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
