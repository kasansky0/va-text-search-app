ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) received written notice from the Veteran requesting a withdrawal of his appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

?

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from October 1984 to October 2004.

The present appeal arises from a November 2020 supplemental claim rating decision which determined new and relevant evidence had been received and denied entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss on its merits. The Veteran appealed that decision by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in October 2021. He elected the Hearing docket. On March 13, 2025, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request and the claim on appeal.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific errors of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

The requirements for making a written withdrawal of an appeal are set out in 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. By regulation, a veteran's "appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal." 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(a). To be effective, the "withdrawal[] must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor, guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf)." 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1). The withdrawal must also include "the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn." 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1). Furthermore, "if the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety, or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal." 38 C.F.R. §20.205(b)(1).

When deciding whether a withdrawal is valid, the Board should ordinarily confine itself to examining the written submission to determine whether it complies with the requirements laid out in the regulation. See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2020). If the withdrawal includes the name of the veteran, the file number, and unambiguously identifies the claim(s) to be withdrawn, the written withdrawal will be considered valid, and the Board need not look to other evidence to find it so. Id.

On March 13, 2025, the Veteran submitted a written statement in which he indicated that he wished to withdraw his appeal for "bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus." See VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim. This written statement also included the Veteran's name and VA file number, and it was signed by the Veteran. The appeal number is assigned to the Veteran's appeal for the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. The Board notes the Veteran is service connected for tinnitus and does not have an active appeal for the issue of tinnitus. In addition, the supplemental claim rating decision on appeal was limited to the merits of the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. The statement clearly and unambiguously indicated the intent/request to withdraw the appeal seeking service connection to bilateral hearing loss.

Accordingly, the Veteran's appeal as to entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is withdrawn. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.
