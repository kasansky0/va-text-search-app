ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for nicotine dependence is denied.

From March 31, 2023, a 20 percent rating, but no higher, for left knee limitation of flexion is granted.

From March 31, 2023, a 40 percent rating, but no higher, for left knee limitation of extension is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The weight of the evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran has a DSM-5 diagnosis of PTSD.

2. Nicotine dependence, including a tobacco use disorder, is not eligible for direct service connection; and there is no evidence of a nexus to a service-connected disability for any current nicotine dependence or tobacco use disorder.

3. From March 31. 2023, the Veteran's left knee flexion, including with use over time and during flare ups was limited to 40 degrees, at most.

4. From March 31, 2023, the Veteran's left knee extension, including with use over time and during flareups was limited to 25 degrees, at most.

5. From March 31, 2023, the Veteran experienced left knee instability, a left knee condition involving the patellofemoral complex was diagnosed, and the use of a left knee brace was prescribed by a medical professional; the use of a cane or walker was not prescribed.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2009 to November 2012.  

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of July 3, 2023 (PTSD), July 17, 2023 (left knee), and August 7, 2023 (nicotine dependence) rating decisions.  In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior rating decisions.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 3, 2023, July 18, 2023, and August 7, 2023 decisions.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 3, 2023 (PTSD), July 18, 2023 (left knee), and August 7, 2023 (nicotine dependence) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The issue of entitlement to a TDIU is raised by the record as part and parcel of the claim seeking an increased left knee rating.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  The issue is added to the appeal and discussed in additional detail below.  

1. Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

Service connection for PTSD requires: (1) a diagnosis of the disorder made in accordance with the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred; and (3) a link established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304(f), 4.125(a).

The Board must consider all the evidence of record and make appropriate determinations of competence, credibility, and weight.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991); Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding evidence is not in approximate balance, or nearly equal, when the evidence "persuasively favors one side or the other").

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a claim seeking service connection for PTSD.  A March 2023 VA initial PTSD examination was provided to evaluate the claim.  The examiner, a psychologist, diagnosed major depressive disorder and cannabis use disorder.  She did not diagnose PTSD.  The Veteran is already service connected for a major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with anxious distress and opioid use disorder, in early remission.  The examiner's examination listed the diagnostic criteria for PTSD and explained how the Veteran's mental health history and symptoms did not meet these criteria.  As a psychologist, the VA examiner is qualified to make diagnoses under the DSM-5.  VA treatment records include a January 2022 negative PTSD screening test.  They do not include any diagnosis of PTSD.  While the Veteran has asserted a claim for service connection for PTSD, he does not have the medical or psychological training to diagnose this condition.  Thus, the weight of the evidence, does not support a finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD under the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.  Accordingly, service connection for PTSD must be denied.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304(f), 4.125(a).    

2. Entitlement to service connection for nicotine dependence is denied.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

Service connection is also warranted for disability that is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  see also Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (holding that Section 1110 "requires compensation when a service-connected disease or injury is a but-for cause of a present-day disability").

The provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1103 prohibit service connection for a disability as a result of disease or injury attributable to the use of tobacco products during a veteran's active service.  The term "tobacco products" includes cigarettes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.300(a).  This regulation does not prohibit service connection if the disability resulted from a disease that is "otherwise shown" to have been incurred in service, meaning that the disability can be service-connected on some basis other than a veteran's use of tobacco products in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.300(b).  In other words, secondary service connection may be awarded for a tobacco-related disability that is caused or aggravated by a primary service-connected disability that is not due to tobacco use during service.  VAOPGCPREC 6-2003 (Oct. 28, 2003).

The duty to assist requires VA to provide an examination when the record contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability or signs and symptoms of a current disability, the record indicates that the disability or signs and symptoms of disability may be associated with military service, and the record does not contain sufficient information to make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); see also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006).

In May 2023, the Veteran filed a claim seeking entitlement to service connection for nicotine dependence.  The February 2024 rating decision includes a favorable finding that tobacco use disorder has been diagnosed.  The Board notes August 2022 VA treatment record describe nicotine dependence and list tobacco use disorder as an active problem.  Service treatment records confirm the Veteran smoked cigarettes during his active service.  However, the Veteran has not provided any argument or evidence as to how a current disability is linked to his active service or to how it is secondary to (caused or aggravated by) a service connected disability, including service connected major depressive disorder with cannabis use disorder.  The March 2023 VA initial PTSD examination did not include any diagnosis or observations related to tobacco use.  There is no evidence of a nexus or indications of a possible nexus based on secondary service connection.   

Initially, the Board finds VA's duty to obtain an examination and/or medical opinion has not been triggered.  A current tobacco use disorder or nicotine dependence is not eligible for service connection based on the Veteran's in-service use of tobacco products.  38 C.F.R. § 3.300(a).  There is no argument or evidence indicating tobacco use or nicotine dependence may have been caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  Thus, the low bar for additional development under McLendon is not met.  See McLendon.

Here, direct service connection based on in-service tobacco use is prohibited.  Further, there is no evidence of any nexus, including a nexus based on secondary service connection.  The evidence is not in at least relative equipoise as to service connection, and there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  Entitlement to service connection for nicotine dependence, including a tobacco use disorder, must be denied. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1103, 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.300, 3.303, 3.310.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for a left knee disability

Rating Criteria

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes (DCs).  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  The basis of disability ratings is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body, to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

When there is a question as to which of two ratings apply, VA will assign the higher of the two where the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding evidence is not in approximate balance, or nearly equal, when the evidence "persuasively favors one side or the other").

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern; therefore, the more critical evidence consists of the evidence generated during the appeal period.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Further, the Board must evaluate the medical evidence of record since and consider the appropriateness of a "staged rating" (i.e., assignment of different ratings for distinct periods of time, based on the facts).  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

In rating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, it is necessary to consider, along with the schedular criteria, functional loss due to flare-ups of pain, fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, and weakness.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  In order to be adequate, VA examinations must include joint testing for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint.  Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).  VA examiners must provide opinions regarding flare-ups based upon estimates derived from information procured from relevant sources, including lay statements, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.  Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).

When rating the knee, separate ratings may be assigned for compensable limitation of both flexion and extension, or for limitation of motion and instability or subluxation of the knee, or meniscal pathology.  However, a separate rating can only be assigned where additional compensable symptomatology is shown that is not duplicative of that used to assign another rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14; VAOPGCPREC 09-04 (2004), 69 Fed. Reg. 59990 (2004); VAOPGCPREC 23-97 (1997), 62 Fed. Reg. 63604 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 9-98 (1998), 63 Fed. Reg. 56704 (1998); Lichtenfels v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 484 (1991).

In Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that, as a matter of law, separate ratings are not precluded for limitation of motion (DCs 5003, 5260 and 5261), meniscal disability (DCs 5258 and 5259), and instability (DC 5257).

Diagnostic Code 5256 applies to ankylosis of the knee.

Diagnostic Code 5257 provides ratings for recurrent subluxation or lateral instability.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for either (a) sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribing a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation; or (b) unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribing either an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability and a medical provider prescribing both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation.

Diagnostic Code 5257 also provides for ratings based on patellar instability.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: a brace, cane, or walker.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker.

Note [1] to DC 5257 states that for patellar instability, the patellofemoral complex consists of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon.  Note [2] to DC 5257 states that a surgical procedure that does not involve repair of one or more patellofemoral components that contribute to the underlying instability shall not qualify as surgical repair for patellar instability (including, but not limited to, arthroscopy to remove loose bodies and joint aspiration).

Under DC 5258, dislocation of the semilunar cartilage of the knee with frequent episodes of "locking," pain and effusion into the joint warrants a 20 percent disability rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5258.  Under DC 5259, symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage warrants a 10 percent evaluation.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5259.In 

Normal range of motion (ROM) of the knee is to zero (0) degrees (full extension ROM) to 140 degrees (full flexion ROM).  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II.

Under DC 5260, a noncompensable rating is warranted where flexion of the knee is limited to 60 degrees, and a 10 percent evaluation is warranted when flexion is limited to 45 degrees.  A 20 percent disability rating is warranted when flexion is limited to 30 degrees, and a 30 percent rating is warranted when flexion of the leg is limited to 15 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260.

Under DC 5261, a noncompensable rating is warranted when extension of the knee is limited to 5 degrees, and a 10 percent disability rating is warranted when extension of the knee is limited to 10 degrees.  A 20 percent disability rating is warranted when extension is limited to 15 degrees, and a 30 percent rating is warranted when extension limited to 20 degrees.  A 40 percent disability rating is warranted when extension is limited to 30 degrees, and a 50 percent disability rating is warranted when extension of the leg is limited to 45 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261.

Diagnostic Code 5263 applies to impairment of the tibia and fibula.  Diagnostic code 5263 is applicable to genu recurvatum.  

Additionally, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5003, degenerative arthritis established by X-ray findings will be rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5003.  When however, the limitation of motion of the specific joint or joints involved is non-compensable under the appropriate diagnostic codes, a rating of 10 percent is for application for each such major joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion, to be combined.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5003.

Under Diagnostic Code 5024, tenosynovitis, including tendonitis and tendinosis, are evaluated as degenerative arthritis under Diagnostic Code 5003, based on limitation of motion of affected parts.

Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

The assignment of a particular Diagnostic Code is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case."  Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993).  One diagnostic code may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, the current diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology.  See Pernorio v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 625, 629 (1992).

The amputation rule provides that the combined rating for disabilities affecting an extremity cannot exceed the rating assigned for an amputation at the elective level, were amputation to be performed.  38 C.F.R. § 4.68.  Amputation of a lower extremity is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5160-5173.  As relevant to this appeal, DC 5162 allows for a 60 percent rating for amputation of the thigh at the middle or lower thirds.  The amputation rule does not bar the assignment of ratings which accurately reflect the Veteran's disability picture for an extremity.  Instead, it places a limit on the maximum level of compensation that can be paid, which is commensurate with the maximum level of compensation that would be paid were the limb to be amputated.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.68; see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5160-5165 (concerning ratings for amputation of the thigh and leg).

Evidence Review

In April 2023, VA received the Veteran's claim seeking a rating in excess of 10 percent for his service connected left knee disability.  At that time a 10 percent rating was applied under DC 5260 based on limitation of flexion.  The July 2023 rating decision and February 2024 HLR rating decision continued the 10 percent rating under DC 5024-5260 from March 31, 2023.  This hyphenated DC denotes left knee tendonitis/tendinosis is rated based on limitation of flexion.  38 C.F.R.  § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5260, 5024.  The July 2023 and February 2024 rating decisions noted the Veteran's claim was postmarked March 31, 2023.  

In support of this claim, the Veteran submitted a February 2023 VA knee disability benefits questionnaire which was completed by T. S., a private nurse practitioner.  She confirmed the diagnosis of left knee tendonitis/tendinosis.  She noted the Veteran reported flare ups of constant pain, popping, stiffness and swelling.  These symptoms limited his ability to sit, stand, squat, bend down, walk long distances, and navigate stairs.  During flare ups his knee was unstable, he used a brace and cane, and he had to limit physical activities.  He needed to rest frequently.  The examiner confirmed a history of instability and frequent effusion.  On initial range of motion testing and with passive range of motion testing, left knee flexion was limited to 70 degrees.  Full extension was observed (to zero degrees).   T. S. noted evidence of pain with weight bearing, nonweight bearing, active motion, passive motion, and at rest.  The pain caused functional loss as the Veteran reported it impacted his ability to perform physical activities including walking, standing, playing with his children, and using stairs.  With repeated motion testing, there was no loss of range of motion or functional ability.  T. S. found procured evidence did not indicate any additional reduction of functional ability with repeated use over time.  During flare ups, she found the Veteran's statements indicated pain, weakness and incoordination would additionally reduce functional ability.  She estimated flexion would be limited to 40 degrees and extension would be limited to 25 degrees.  T. S. noted interference with standing, disturbance of locomotion, less movement than normal, weakened movement, interference with sitting and swelling contributed to the left knee disability.  She did not observe muscle atrophy or ankylosis.  In evaluating joint stability, T. S. indicated recurrent subluxation was present and required the Veteran to use a brace that had been prescribed by a medical provider.  Recurrent patellar dislocation, shin splints, stress fractures, or any other tibial or fibular impairment were not diagnosed.  The Veteran did not have any meniscal conditions and he had not undergone any knee surgeries.  The left knee disability limited the Veteran's ability to perform occupational tasks.      

In July 2023, a VA knee conditions examination was provided.  The examiner diagnosed patellar tendinitis.  As medical history, she noted for seven years the Veteran had left knee pain with repetitive squatting, climbing, and prolonged walking on hard surfaces.  The Veteran had moderate to severe left knee flare ups if he did "too much climbing" or walked longer than 40 minutes.  There was no history of instability, recurrent subluxation, or frequent effusion.  On initial testing and with passive testing, range of motion was limited to 130 degrees.  Extension was not limited.  The examiner observed pain in flexion with weight bearing, active motion, and passive motion.  The pain caused functional loss.  No changes were observed with repeated use testing.  The examiner indicated the Veteran was being examined after repeated use over time and during a flare up.  Thus, no additional loss of range of motion or additional functional limitations were indicated under those circumstances.  There was no muscle atrophy, ankylosis, recurrent subluxation. persistent instability, patellar instability, recurrent patellar dislocation, shin splints, stress fractures, or other tibial or fibular impairment.  No meniscus conditions were diagnosed, and the Veteran had not undergone any left knee surgeries.  The examiner noted the Veteran regularly used a knee brace for left side patella tendon pain.  She observed recurring severe left knee pain would impact the Veteran's ability to engage in functional tasks including squatting, kneeling, climbing ladders, and walking longer than 40 minutes.  

VA treatment records show, in August 2021, a VA primary provider noted the Veteran's report of increased left knee pain and observed decreased range of motion, tenderness to palpation, and crepitus with passive motion.  No effusion was present.  The Veteran was referred additional treatment (physical therapy and pain management/knee joint injections).  He was instructed to continue range of motion exercise, wear a knee brace, and take medications as needed for pain.  August 2021 x-rays showed normal bilateral knees.  A January 2022 VA nursing note documents the Veteran's report of left knee pain, swelling, and limited flexion.  In August 2022, a VA primary care provider observed decreased range of motion, tenderness to palpation, and crepitation with passive range of motion.  He directed the Veteran to continue range of motion exercises and to wear a knee brace.  

Painful and Limited Range of Motion

The February 2023 DBQ and the July 2023 VA knee examination confirm the Veteran had painful and limited range of motion over the appeal period.  His symptoms were subject to flare ups.  During flare ups, a private nurse practitioner found left knee flexion was limited to 40 degrees.  During flare ups, a private nurse practitioner found left knee extension was limited to 25 degrees.  There is no evidence of flexion limited to less than 40 degrees or extension limited to more than 25 degrees at any time.  

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, left knee flexion was limited to less than 45 degrees, but not to less than 30 degrees.  A 20 percent rating, but no higher, under DC 5260 from March 31, 2023 is warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260; see also Butts, supra.  

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, left knee extension was limited to more than 20 degrees, but not more than 30 degrees.  An additional 40 percent rating, but no higher, under DC 6261 from March 31, 2023 is warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261.

Instability

The February 2023 DBQ documents the Veteran's reports of left knee popping, and instability.  It also includes T. S.'s confirmation of recurrent subluxation and the Veteran's use of a medically prescribed left knee brace.  The July 2023 VA examiner did not find any left knee instability.  However, she confirmed a diagnosis of patellar tendonitis and the Veteran's regular use of a left knee brace for patella tendon pain.  VA treatment records show the Veteran was directed by his VA primary care treatment provider to use a left knee brace.  

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, left knee instability has been present over the appeal period; there is a diagnosis involving the patellofemoral complex; and a left knee brace is prescribed by a medical provider.  While the Veteran has not undergone any surgical repair, his symptomatology is most closely aligned with the 20 percent rating prescribed for patellar instability.  There is some evidence that the Veteran used a cane, however there is no evidence that a cane or walker was prescribed by a medical provider.  A rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted.  Thus, a 20 percent rating, but no higher, under DC 5257 is warranted from March 31, 2023.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257

Additional Ratings 

Over the appeal period the Veteran has maintained movement in his left knee, including with use over time and during flare ups.  There is no evidence of ankylosis.  There is no evidence of any meniscal condition.  There is no evidence of any tibia or fibula impairment.  There is no evidence of genu recurvatum.  Additional ratings for the left knee disability are not indicated.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DCs 5256, 5258, 5259, 5262. 5263.

Effective Date of Increased Ratings

The Board acknowledges the effective date of an award of increased compensation can be up to one year prior to the date of claim if there is a factually ascertainable increase in disability during this period.  Here, there is no evidence that the Veteran's left knee disability increased within one year of March 31, 2023 (postmark date of claim).  VA treatment records affirmatively show the Veteran reported increased left knee pain more than one year prior to filing his claim.  Thus, an effective date for the increased left knee ratings, prior to March 31, 2023, is not available.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.  

Under the provisions of the AMA, the Board must remand any appeal that cannot be granted in full for correction of a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  The Board may also remand to ensure compliance with a regulatory or statutory duty if such compliance would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  Id.

The July 2023 VA knee conditions examiner noted the left knee disability impacted the Veteran's ability to perform occupational tasks because he was limited in his ability to squat, kneel, climb ladders, and walk for more than 40 minutes.  The February 2023 VA DBQ also indicates the left knee disability impacts the Veteran's ability to perform occupational tasks.  VA treatment records show the Veteran was fired from jobs in April 2023 and May 2023.  In May 2023, he submitted a statement asserting he was working for meal delivery services and looking for a "good stable job."  The evidence suggests the Veteran may not be gainfully employed and his service connected disabilities may interfere with his ability to be employed.  Entitlement to a TDIU is raised by the record.  See Rice, supra.

Here, evidence added to the file after the initial rating decisions now on appeal is relevant to the issue of entitlement to a TDIU.  As the Board cannot consider this evidence, the AOJ should develop and adjudicate the Rice TDIU now added to the appeal.  Review by the AOJ will ensure the Veteran is afforded the requisite due process.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); see also Disabled Am. Veterans v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 327 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Develop and adjudicate the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, which is raised by the record as part and parcel of the appeal seeking an increased left knee rating.
