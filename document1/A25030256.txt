FINDINGS OF FACT

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from April 1970 through August 1970. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in January 2021 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. 

In the January 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on February 19, 2025. The transcript for this hearing has been associated with the record. As the transcript of the February 2025 hearing reflects, at the proceeding the Veteran requested that the 90-day post hearing period be waived.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. As discussed below, the Board grants the claims in appellate status.

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran states that he was exposed to frequent rifle and missile fire noise during service, as well as loud generator noises. The Veteran says that he began to have hearing problems in service, and that his hearing has worsened significantly in the years since. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. Id.; see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

The AOJ favorably found as relates to this appeal that the Veteran has a hearing loss disability as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 and that the Veteran had in-service noise exposure.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in December 2020. The examiner noted the Veteran's conceded in-service noise exposure, and that the Veteran reported no interceding occupational or recreational noise exposure. However, the examiner found that, because the service treatment records did not include treatment for hearing loss, it was less likely than not that the Veteran's hearing loss was caused by or incurred in service. 

At the February 2025 hearing, the Veteran testified that he was attached to a missile battery in service, and that he was exposed to frequent rifle and missile fire. The Veteran said that he was only provided with hearing protection from these noise exposures half the time. The Veteran stated that he was frequently around large, loud generators on base as well. The Veteran reported minimal noise exposure since service. The Veteran stated that his most significant noise exposure was in service. The Veteran reported that his hearing issues began in service, but worsened considerably 10-12 years ago. 

The Board affords the December 2020 VA examiner's opinion little probative value as the rationale relies primarily on the lack of documentation of the disability during service. The Board notes that the absence of evidence of a hearing loss disability in service is not fatal to a veteran's claim. See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89

The Board finds the Veteran's testimony of the onset and continuation of his hearing loss symptoms since service to be credible. Further, the Board is within its province to weigh the Veteran's testimony and determine whether it supports a finding of service incurrence and continued symptoms since service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker, 708 F.3d 1331. The Veteran's testimony is also consistent with his MOS and medal as a rifleman, as well as his conceded in-service noise exposure. 

Considering the inadequacies in the VA examiner's opinion, the Board finds that when resolving reasonable doubt that the criteria for finding a nexus between the currently diagnosed disability and the in-service noise exposure are met, and on this basis, grants service connection. 

Accordingly, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

2. Service connection for tinnitus is denied.

The Veteran also claims that his tinnitus began in service as intermittent ringing in his ears during night fire training in basic training. 

The service treatment records do not show complaints of tinnitus.

The Veteran received a VA examination in December of 2020 for tinnitus. At the examination, the examiner noted the Veteran's report that his tinnitus began during night fire training while he was in basic training. The examiner noted that there was no intervening significant noise exposure since service. The examiner then opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or incurred in service because his treatment records were silent for tinnitus. 

The Board finds the Veteran's statements to be competent, credible, and highly probative. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). Although his reports conflict with the VA examiner opinion, the Board finds that the Veteran is competent to report that he has experienced ringing in his ear since active service. Id. 

The Board has no reason to doubt the Veteran's reports that his tinnitus had its onset during his military service. Therefore, the Board will resolve reasonable doubt in his favor and grant service connection for tinnitus. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
