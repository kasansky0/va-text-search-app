DOCKET NO. 220611-249044
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The October 29, 2024 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision denying service connection for low back disability, promulgated following receipt of a June 11, 2022 VA Form 10182, is vacated.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's June 11, 2022 VA Form 10182 appeal for Board review of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction's (AOJ) denial of service connection for low back disability should have been treated as an impermissible concurrent election, for reasons explained below, instead of being acted upon by issuing the October 2024 Board decision denying service connection for low back disability. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The October 29, 2024 Board decision denying service connection for low back disability is vacated. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7104; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.1000(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty for training from September 2015 to February 2016. In April 2022, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for low back disability. 

The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 appeal to the Board on June 11, 2022. However, at that time, the issue was already pending development from an April 21, 2022 Higher Level Review Request. See the May 13, 2022 AOJ Higher-Level Review Return. 

Under the circumstances, the Board should not have denied service connection for the low back disability at issue in October 2024. Instead, the June 11, 2022, VA Form 10182 appeal to the Board should have been considered to be an impermissible concurrent election under 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.2500. 

Prior to the Board's October 2024 decision, the AOJ had issued a rating decision on May 27, 2022, finding a duty to assist error for the low back disability claim and indicating that it was going to obtain a VA medical opinion on the matter. That development was not completed until shortly prior to a January 24, 2023 rating decision (denying the claim), which is currently on appeal from a March 25, 2023 VA Form 10182, under Board docket number 230325-333609.

The appropriate action to take in this case, under the circumstances, is to vacate the October 2024 Board decision insofar as it denied service connection for low back disability. The issue is going to be taken up in another Board decision shortly, pursuant to the March 25, 2023 VA Form 10182. Accordingly, the October 29, 2024 Board decision denying service connection for low back disability is vacated.
