ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In an August 2022 rating decision, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) granted entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis, which is a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal as to the claim for entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis; there is therefore no remaining case or controversy pertaining to this claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim for entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2009 to March 2012.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2021 rating decision of a VA RO. In a May 2021 Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran appealed the decision of the RO to the Board.

Entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis is dismissed.

In April 2022, while the Veteran's appeal for entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis was pending before the Board, she filed a Supplemental Claim for entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis. In an August 2022 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis, which constitutes a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal. In a statement in support of claim dated in March 2025, the Veteran's representative requested that the appeal be withdrawn for this reason.  As the benefit sought has already been granted in full, there remains no case or controversy to decide concerning the issue of entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis. Therefore, the appeal is dismissed. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.
