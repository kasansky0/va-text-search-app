ORDER

Service connection for right ear hearing loss is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's right ear hearing loss has been related to his service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for right ear hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1973 to June 1977 and from April 1978 to July 1994.

This appeal is from a May 2024 rating decision.  The Veteran timely appealed to the Board, asking for placement on the direct review docket.

The Board notes the Veteran's the period to request a change of the docket selected has not expired.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(e).  However, as the claim is being granted in full, the Veteran is not prejudiced by the Board's action in immediately granting this appeal.

1. Service connection for right ear hearing loss is granted.

Service connection is granted for any current disability that is the result of a disease contracted or an injury sustained while on active duty service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). 

Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and, (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

For VA purposes, impaired hearing is considered disabling when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or, when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.385.

The Veteran has continuously pursued this claim since August 2022.  

The first inquiry is whether there is a current hearing loss disability.  Here, the Veteran's hearing was testing in August 2022, December 2023, and November 2024.  He met the criteria for a hearing loss disability for VA purposes at the December 2023 VA examination, which falls in the period under review. The Board finds this sufficient to find that there was right ear hearing loss disability during the relevant period.

The Veteran's exposure to traumatic noise during service has been conceded.

The final inquiry is whether there is a relationship to service.  The record shows that the December 2023 and April 2024 VA examiners both attributed the Veteran's hearing loss to noise exposure during service.

Accordingly, without belaboring the point, service connection for right ear hearing loss is warranted and this appeal is granted.
