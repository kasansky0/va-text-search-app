ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left wrist, chronic sprain (claimed as left wrist arthritis), is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability based upon individual unemployability (TDIU), prior to May 3, 2020, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is currently in receipt of a 10 percent rating for his limitation of motion of his left wrist. This is the highest disability rating possible under Diagnostic Code (DC) 5215 for residuals of a left wrist disability, and the evidence does not reflect that the Veteran has ankylosis, or functional ankylosis, of the left wrist.

2. Giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, his left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome is etiologically related to service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left wrist, chronic sprain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a. Diagnostic Code (DC) 5215. 

2. The criteria to establish service connection for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2001 to December 2003.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in June 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act.

By way of procedural history, the Veteran first filed a claim for service connection for bilateral wrists in May 2020, which the AOJ denied in a September 2020 rating decision.

The Veteran filed a May 2021 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim for bilateral wrists, which was denied on the merits in a March 2021 rating decision.

In April 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review of the September 2020 and March 2021 rating decisions, which was denied in an April 2021 rating decision.  The Veteran then filed an April 2021 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim, appealing the rating decision, which was denied in a June 2022 rating decision. 

After the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review of the June 2022 rating decision, the AOJ found a duty to assist error as it related to the Veteran's request for service connection for left wrist arthritis, left wrist scar and left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome.  The claim was transferred to the Supplemental Claim Lane and further development was directed.

In a May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for left wrist sprain and left wrist scar, both with a noncompensable rating, but denied service connection for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome. 

In June 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review for an increased rating for the Veteran's left wrist sprain and left wrist scar and service connection for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome. 

In a June 2023 rating decision, the AOJ increased the Veteran's left wrist sprain to 10 percent, effective June 20, 2019, denied service connection for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome and deferred a decision on the increased rating for left wrist scar.  As such, the issue of the Veteran's left wrist scar is not before the Board in this appeal stream.  

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims of service connection for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome and an increased rating for left wrist, chronic sprain, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court) has held that a claim for a TDIU is part of an increased rating claim when such claim is expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). The Board finds that the issue of TDIU has been raised by the Veteran and is, thus, properly before the Board by virtue of the Veteran's increased rating claim, pursuant to Rice.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to a TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that in the March 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran's representative contended that the Veteran's combined total disability rating of 60 percent has an incorrect effective date of August 1, 2019 and should be changed to June 20, 2019.  This issue was not addressed in a rating decision and thus cannot be appealed in the Notice of Disagreement. 

Additionally, in the coversheet associated with the March 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran's representative stated the following, "If any claim was granted an initial or increased rating, the claimant also wishes to appeal that claim for a STILL HIGHER RATING and EARLIER EFFECTIVE DATE."  To the extent that the Veteran's representative is appealing an earlier effective date of June 20, 2019 for service connection for left wrist chronic sprain, the issue of an earlier effective date for service connection is not addressed in the June 2023 rating decision on appeal and thus cannot be appealed in the Notice of Disagreement. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. 

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a Veteran's present symptomatology with criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  

When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular Diagnostic Code, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § § 3.102, 4.3.

Further, a disability rating may require re-evaluation in accordance with changes in a Veteran's condition.  It is thus essential in determining the level of current impairment that the disability is considered in the context of the entire recorded history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Nevertheless, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in the parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance.  It is essential that the examination on which ratings are based adequately portray the anatomical damage, and the functional loss, with respect to all these elements. The functional loss may be due to absence of part, or all, of the necessary bones, joints and muscles, or associated structures, or to deformity, adhesions, defective innervation, or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion.  Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206 -07 (1995); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 37 92011) ("functional loss caused by pain must be rated at the same level as if that functional loss were caused by some other factor...that actually limited motion" (emphasis removed)). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in §§ 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under §§ 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 acknowledge that a claimant's disability may cause actual pain or painful motion but still not be severe enough to warrant a compensable rating under the appropriate Code.  Pain alone does not rise to the level of functional loss as contemplated by VA regulations applicable to the musculoskeletal system.  Pain in, like deformity of or insufficient nerve supply to, a particular joint may result in functional loss, but only if it limits the ability to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and endurance.  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 38-39 (2011).

The Board must also consider whether VA examiners have elicited information concerning the "severity, frequency, duration, or functional loss manifestations" of such flare-ups. Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).

The Court also has issued the opinion of Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), which clarifies additional requirements that VA examiners should address when assessing musculoskeletal disabilities, holding specifically, that the joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left wrist, chronic sprain (claimed as left wrist arthritis), is denied.

The Veteran contends that a rating in excess ot 10 percent for left wrist, chronic sprain is warranted.

The Veteran's left wrist sprain is currently rated as 10 percent disabling, effective June 20, 2019, under Diagnostic Code 5215. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5215.  

This is the highest rating available based on range of motion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5215. To warrant a higher rating, the evidence would have to demonstrate some level of ankylosis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5214.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, normal range of motion for the wrist is 70 degrees of dorsiflexion (extension) and 80 degrees of palmar flexion. Normal ulnar deviation is 45 degrees, while normal radiation deviation is 20 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate I.

DC 5215 provides for a maximum rating of 10 percent for limitation of motion of the wrist for either the dominant or non-dominant hand when dorsiflexion is less than 15 degrees or when palmer flexion is limited in line with the forearm. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. The maximum rating available under DC 5215 is 10 percent.

DC 5214 pertains to ankylosis of the wrist. In the minor extremity, this is evaluated as follows: unfavorable ankylosis in any degree of palmar flexion or with ulnar or radial deviation (40 percent); unfavorable ankylosis in any other position (30 percent); or favorable ankylosis, defined as in 20 to 30 degrees of dorsiflexion (20 percent). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5214.

Ankylosis is an objective finding or symptom and not a diagnosis. Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021). Notably, multiple definitions of "ankylosis" were discussed in Chavis including general medical dictionary definitions as follows: "[i]mmobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure" (citing DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 94 (33rd ed. 2019)), "[s]tiffening or fixation of a joint as the result of a disease process, with fibrous or bony union across the joint" (citing STEADMAN'S MEDICAL DICTIONARY 95 (28th ed. 2006)), and "[a] stiffening or immobilization of a joint as a result of injury, disease, or surgical intervention" (citing CHURCHILL'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 91 (1989).

Handedness for the purpose of a dominant rating will be determined by the evidence of record, or by testing on VA examination. Only one hand shall be considered dominant. As demonstrated by the medical evidence of record, including an April 2023 VA examination report, the Veteran is right-handed, and as such, a wrist disability rating for his non-dominant left hand is applicable here. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.69. 

The Veteran first underwent a VA wrist conditions examination in June 2021, where the examiner was diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. The Board notes that the Veteran was not diagnosed with a left wrist sprain. The examiner noted normal range of motion for the Veteran's left wrist and no functional loss.  Lastly, the examiner found no ankylosis of the left wrist.  See June 9, 2021 VA examination report.

The Veteran next underwent a VA examination for his left wrist in April 2023, where the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with left wrist chronic sprain.  The Veteran reported that he started having pain in his left wrist since the military from heavy carrying, lifting and pushing, with occasional pain.  The Veteran did not report flare-ups.  

The VA examiner stated that the Veteran's left wrist range of motion measurements were abnormal, or outside the normal range, and that range of motion itself did not contribute to a functional loss.  Both active and passive range of motion measurements were dorsiflexion 60 degrees, palmar flexion 70 degrees, ulnar deviation 35 degrees, and radial deviation 15 degrees. The examiner reported that there was no limitation of motion specifically attributable to pain, weakness, fatigability, or incoordination and no objective evidence of crepitus, localized tenderness, or pain of the left wrist. Additionally, there was no additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions during repetitive-use testing. 

An examination was not conducted, nor were estimated range of motion measurements provided during a flare-up as the Veteran did not report flare-ups. 

The VA examiner noted that there were no other factors contributing to the Veteran's left wrist sprain.  Further, the examiner opined that there was no muscle atrophy nor ankylosis. Lastly, the examiner noted that there were no other pertinent findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms related to the diagnosis, the Veteran was not using an assistive device such as a brace, and there was no functional loss attributed to the Veteran's left wrist chronic sprain.  

The examiner noted that the Veteran was scheduled for diagnostic testing in April 2023, but did not attend the appointment. See April 12, 2023 VA examination report and addendum.

Concerning whether the Veteran has ankylosis of the left wrist, the Board notes that both the June 2021 and April 2023 VA examiners opined that there was no ankylosis and there is also no finding of ankylosis.  Considering all the evidence of record, the Board finds that there is no objective evidence of ankylosis or functional ankylosis at any point during the appeal period. Because of this, a disability rating under DC 5214 is not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5214. 

As noted above, under DC 5215, a 10 percent rating is warranted when palmar flexion is limited in line with the forearm or dorsiflexion is less than 15 degrees. The Veteran is currently in receipt of a 10 percent rating under this Diagnostic Code, which is the maximum rating allowable under DC 5215. 

Thus, a higher schedular rating for the wrist is only warranted when there is evidence of ankylosis, rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5214.  However, the most probative evidence does not demonstrate that his left wrist has been ankylosed or functionally ankylosed at any time during the pendency of the claim. No other diagnostic codes are appropriate for rating the Veteran's left wrist disability.

As the Veteran already has the highest possible schedular rating of 10 percent for limitation of motion of the left wrist under DC 5215, a rating over 10 percent is not warranted. Because limitation of motion of the wrist is specifically listed in the rating schedule, it may not be rated by analogy under a different diagnostic code. Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337 (2015). Therefore, no other diagnostic codes are potentially applicable which might afford a higher rating on an alternative basis.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the increased rating claim adjudicated herein. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).

Accordingly, an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left wrist, chronic sprain is denied.

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of the following: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1153(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Although lay persons are considered competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, some medical issues fall outside of the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).

Under the benefit of the doubt rule, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021).

Entitlement to service connection for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome is granted.

The Veteran claims his left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome is related to service.

The Veteran has a current diagnosis for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome. See July 2021 VA peripheral nerves conditions examination report.  

Therefore, the element of a current diagnosis of left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome is established. 

Thus, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome is related to his active service.

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records shows that in a May 2023 report of medical history (RMH), the Veteran checked yes to swollen or painful joints, and painful wrist.  The Veteran reported painful wrist when he awakes in the morning and that he thinks it is associated with arthritis.   The examiner noted bilateral wrist pain, which he was not seen for.  See May 22, 2003 RMH.  Further, in the May 2003 report of medical examination (RME), the examiner noted bilateral wrist pain with an orthopedic consult.  See May 22, 2003 RME. 

The Veteran's post-service treatment records show he underwent left wrist carpal tunnel release surgery in June 2019.  See June 25, 2019 operative report.  

The Veteran underwent multiple VA examinations for his left wrist in June 2021 and April 2023, where the Veteran was diagnosed with left carpal tunnel syndrome.  The Veteran reported he developed left wrist pain from heavy lifting, carrying, pushing while in the military, which resulted in numbness and tingling in the wrist afterwards.  See June 9, 2021 VA wrist conditions, July 17, 2021 peripheral nerves conditions, and April 12, 2023 peripheral nerves conditions VA examination reports. 

In a May 2020 private treatment record, Dr. T.G. opined that the Veteran's bilateral carpel tunnel syndrome is a repetitive trauma type problem due to manual activities of a mechanic and causally related to his civilian work.  See May 20, 2020 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

In April 2023, the examiner initially opined that the Veteran's left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome was less likely than not incurred in or caused by service as the Veteran did not report any complaints of nerve pain in his left arm during service.  However, in that same opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome was at least as likely as not related to his MOS as a general repairman as the most common causes of carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome are trauma, repetitive motion, and frequent pressure on elbow for extended periods due to sitting posture. The examiner noted that carpal tunnel syndrome is considered an inflammatory disorder caused by repetitive stress, physical injury, or a medical condition, but noted it is difficult to determine the precise cause.  See April 12, 2023 C&P exam. 

There are no additional medical opinions of record.  As the evidence is in relative equipoise as there is both a positive and negative medical nexus opinion, the Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt.  Accordingly, service connection for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Board notes that entitlement to a TDIU, prior to May 3, 2020, is on appeal from the left wrist, chronic sprain increased rating claim.  

The issue of entitlement to a TDIU is inextricably intertwined with the Board's grants of service connection of left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome in this decision.  As such, the AOJ needs to first assign a disability rating and effective date prior to the adjudicate of the issue of entitlement to a TDIU for the portion of the appeal period prior to May 3, 2020.
