ORDER

The severance of service connection for scar, left wrist was improper; restoration of service connection for scar, left wrist is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The grant of service connection for scar, left wrist in a May 2023 rating decision is not shown to have been clearly and unmistakably erroneous.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for restoration of service connection for scar, left wrist have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5112; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2001 to December 2003. 

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2023 rating decision. In July 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a HLR decision, which proposed to sever service connection for scar, left wrist. In November 2023, the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the initial rating decision. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Veteran contends that the November 2023 rating decision that severed service connection for left wrist scar was improper. 

By way of history, in a May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for scar, left wrist with an effective date of June 20, 2019, the date the VA received his intent to file a claim. In a July 2023 rating decision, the AOJ proposed to sever service connection for the left wrist scar. The AOJ stated that the May 2023 rating decision incorrectly established service connection for left wrist scar as the primary issue of the cause of the scar was left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome and the evidence did not show that this condition occurred in or was caused by service. Essentially, the AOJ stated that since the left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome was not service connected, the left wrist scar could not be service connected on a secondary basis. 

The AOJ severed service connection for scar, left wrist, effective June 20, 2019, in a November 2023 rating decision. In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ concluded that severance for scar, left wrist was warranted due to finding that the grant of service connection was due to clear and unmistakable error.

Service connection will be severed only where evidence establishes that it is clearly and unmistakably erroneous (CUE) (the burden of proof being on the Government). 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(d). VA must assure both that due process has been observed in the process of severance and that CUE exists in the award of service connection.

When severance of service connection is considered warranted, a rating proposing severance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. The claimant will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that service connection should be maintained. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received within that period, final rating action will be taken, and the award will be reduced or discontinued, if in order, effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(d).

To establish that a grant of service connection was the product of CUE, VA must show that (1) either the correct facts as they were known at the time were not before the adjudicator, the adjudicator made an erroneous factual finding, or the statutory or regulatory provisions were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error was undebatable, not merely a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated; and (3) the error manifestly changed the outcome of the prior decision. See Allen v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 54, 58-59 (2007); Stallworth v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 482, 487-88 (2006); cf. Bustos v. West, 179 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14, 319 (1992) (en banc). A clear and unmistakable error is one about which reasonable minds could not differ. See, e.g., 38 C.F.R. § 20.1403(a).

In most respects, the CUE standard for severing service connection under § 3.105(d) is equivalent to the CUE standard for reversing or revising a prior final decision under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a). See Baughman v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 563, 566 (1991). Section 3.105(d) places at least as high a burden of proof on the VA when it seeks to sever service connection as § 3.105(a) places upon an appellant seeking to have an unfavorable previous determination overturned. See id.

However, the determination is not limited to the law and the record that existed at the time of the original decision. VA may consider medical evidence and diagnoses that postdate the original award of service connection to demonstrate that the diagnosis on which service connection was predicated is clearly erroneous. Stallworth, 20 Vet. App. at 488. The Secretary's burden is not to prove clear and unmistakable error in the original decision in the same manner a claimant would show CUE under sections 5109A or 7111. Id.

A decision that is reversed or amended based on CUE is revised to conform to the true state of the facts or the law that existed at the time of the original adjudication. Allen, 21 Vet. App. at 62 (internal quotations omitted).

As an initial matter, the Board must determine whether the AOJ followed the due process requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(d) for severing service connection.

The AOJ issued the proposed rating decision to sever service connection for scar, left wrist in July 2023. The Veteran was notified in July 2023 at his latest address of record of this contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor and was given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that service connection should be maintained. The notification letter also informed the Veteran that he had the opportunity for a predetermination hearing if such a request for a hearing was received by VA within 30 days from the date of the notice. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(i). The Veteran did not request a predetermination hearing.

The AOJ proceeded by issuing the November 2023 rating decision, which severed service connection for the scar, left wrist effective June 20, 2019. The AOJ severed service connection on the date the Veteran was granted entitlement for the condition. Notice of this rating decision, plus his appeal rights, was sent to the Veteran in a November 2023 notification letter. The Board finds that this effective date of the severance was not proper as it was not greater than the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date the November 2023 notice expired. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(d).

In this regard, January 1, 2024, would be an appropriate date of severance as it would be greater than the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the November 2023 notice expired, which is more favorable to the Veteran. 

However, the Board notes that an improper effective date does not render the entire severance improper as the Board is able to correct this error in this decision in favor of the Veteran by restoring service connection for the left wrist scar. 

The next determination the Board must make is whether the grant of service connection for scar, left wrist was clearly and unmistakably erroneous. In this regard, the Board finds that the severance of service connection for the grant of service connection was improper because there is probative evidence indicating that the Veteran's scar, left wrist is related to his now-service connected condition of left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome. 

Turning to the evidence of record, a June 2019 VA treatment record documents that the Veteran underwent surgery for left carpal tunnel syndrome on June 25, 2019. A 2 cm longitudinal incision was made along the left volar wrist between the Kaplan line and the volar wrist crease in line with the radial aspect of the ring finger. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA scar examination in June 2021. The examiner found a scar on the Veteran's left palmar hand due to surgery. 

An August 2021 VA scar examination confirmed that the Veteran had an incisional, linear scar on the palmar side of the left hand that is flat and hyperpigmented as a result of a carpal tunnel release. 

Another VA scar examination in February 2022 confirmed that the Veteran had a scar on the palmar left hand.

The Veteran was again examined by the VA for his left wrist scar in April 2023. He was diagnosed with a scar from left carpal tunnel surgery. 

Notably, this is not a claim of service connection to be evaluated as to whether the claim should be granted based upon a finding of an approximate balance of positive evidence; nor denied because the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim. In this matter, the standard to be employed is whether there is "clear and unmistakable evidence" of an error. Here, there is evidence that the Veteran's scar, left wrist is related to his left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome for which he required surgery. 

The Board acknowledges that at the time of the severance of the left wrist scar, the Veteran was not service connected for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome.  The claim for service connection for left wrist scar and service connection for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome stems from the same claim. See May 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim; VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. The Veteran appealed the claim that denied service connection for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome in a separate appeal. Consequently, in a separate April 2025 decision, the Board granted service connection for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome, which is the primary underlying condition on which the left wrist scar resulted from due to carpal tunnel surgery. 

As the Board has granted service connection for left carpal with cubital tunnel syndrome pursuant to an April 2025 decision, restoration of service connection for scar, left wrist is warranted.

As a final matter, the Board notes that while the AOJ had granted service connection for scar, left wrist effective June 20, 2019, the date the VA received his intent to file a claim, the Veteran's date of surgery for left carpal tunnel syndrome was June 25, 2019. Upon restoration of service connection for scar, left wrist, the AOJ should correct the effective date to reflect the date of surgery, June 25, 2019.
