ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to August 2, 2023, for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's minor child is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

1. On August 2, 2023, the Veteran first notified the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) of his minor child, K.J.

2. VA did not receive any claim, formal or informal, seeking entitlement to dependency benefits for his minor child, K.J., prior to August 2, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to August 2, 2023, for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's minor child have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1115, 5101, 5110, 5124; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.57, 3.204, 3.401.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from November 1983 to April 1996. 

In November 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ/Regional Office (RO)) issued a decision granting the Veteran's claim for an additional dependency benefit for his minor child, K.J., effective August 2, 2023 (payment starting on September 1, 2023). In November 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, requesting a Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the effective date given in the decision. In December 2023, the AOJ denied of the claims.

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran requested the Direct Review. The Board notes that the evidentiary window based on the Veteran's selection of HLR is limited to the evidence of record as of the date the AOJ issued notice of the prior applicable decision. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Legal Criteria

A veteran who is in receipt of disability compensation of 30 percent or more is entitled to an additional allowance for each dependent. 38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4(b)(2). 

A "child" of the Veteran for VA benefits purposes is defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.57.  A child must be "unmarried" and must be either (i) under the age of 18; (ii) have become permanently incapable of self-support before the age of 18; or (iii) be between the ages of 18 and 23 and pursuing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution.  38 U.S.C. § 101(4)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.57(a)(1).

VA law establishes a stepchild is a legitimate or an illegitimate child of the veteran's spouse, who acquired that status before the age of 18 years and must be a member of the Veteran's household to be considered the Veteran's dependent.  38 U.S.C. § 101(4)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.57(a)(1).

An award of additional compensation on account of dependents based on the establishment of a disability rating in the percentage evaluation specified by law for the purpose shall be payable from the effective date of such rating; but only if proof of dependents is received within one year from the date of notification of such rating action. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(f); 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b)(3).

Regarding additional compensation for dependents, the effective date will be the latest of the following dates: (1) date of claim; (2) date the dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating, provided evidence of dependency is received within a year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the Veteran's award. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b). The earliest that the additional award of compensation for a dependent may be paid to the Veteran is the first day of the month following the effective date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.31.

The "date of claim" for a dependent minor child is the date of the child's birth, if evidence of the event is received within a year of the event; for a dependent stepchild is the date of the marriage, if evidence of the event is received within a year of the event; otherwise, the date notice is received of the dependent's existence, if evidence is received within a year of a request from VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.401. Under 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a), a specific claim must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).

In Sharp v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 267, 276 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the effective date for additional compensation for dependents shall be the same date as the rating decision giving rise to such entitlement, irrespective of any previous grant of section 1115 benefits, if proof of a dependent is submitted within one year of notice of the rating action. Although the Court held that there can be "multiple rating decisions that establish entitlement to additional dependency compensation," it still required that proof of dependent status be submitted within one year of notice of rating action. Id. 

For purposes of determining eligibility for benefits for a dependent spouse or child, VA will accept a claimant's statements as proof of marriage, dissolution of a marriage, proof of a birth of a child, or death of a dependent, provided that the statement contains: the date (month and year) and place of the event (i.e. the place of birth); the full name and relationship of the other person to the claimant; where the claimant's dependent child does not reside with the claimant, the name and address of the person who has custody of the child; and the social security number of the other person. 38 U.S.C. § 5124; 38 C.F.R. § 3.204. Although written evidence serves as sufficient proof, however, other, additional proof is required under circumstances where the claimant does not reside within a state; the statement, on its face, raises questions of validity; there is conflicting evidence of record; or where there is a reasonable indication that there is fraud or a misrepresentation of the relationship in question. See McColley v. West, 13 Vet. App. 553, 557 (2000).

There is a presumption of regularity in the administrative process, and it is presumed that a claimant received proper notice by VA. See Boyd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 63, 71-72 (2014) (holding that under the presumption of regularity, if notice is sent to the claimant's last known address of record, it will be presumed that VA properly discharged its official duties). This presumption may only be rebutted with "clear evidence to the contrary." Ashley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 307, 309 (1992). See also Mindenhall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 271 (1994).

Analysis

In a September 2012 rating decision, the RO rated the Veteran's combined, total service-connected disabilities at 30 percent or greater, effective, June 1, 2012. He was notified of this rating action by letter on October 4, 2012, which was mailed to his then current mailing address of record. Information and forms regarding dependency benefits was included with the letter.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA 21-686c Application Request to Add And/Or Remove Dependents, requesting to add his minor child, K.J., to his award. Within the form, the Veteran provided the child's birthday, social security number, and notated he was his biological child. The minor child was subsequently added to the Veteran's award, effective August 2, 2023, with payments beginning effective September 1, 2023, the first day of the month following the effective date. The Veteran disagrees with the effective date given.

Having considered the pertinent evidence of record an earlier effective date for the addition of the Veteran's minor child, K.J., is not warranted. 

Per the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b), the effective date for additional compensation for a dependent child will be the latest of the following dates: (1) date of claim; (2) date the dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating, provided evidence of dependency is received within a year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the Veteran's award. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b). Pertinent to this claim, the Veteran's minor child was born on May [REDACTED] 2018, however, the Veteran did not file claim to add this child until August 2, 2023. As this is not within one-year of the date of birth, an effective date of May 26, 2018, is not possible. 

Further, the date notice was received of the dependent child's existence was August 2, 2023, the date dependency arose was May 26, 2018, the effective date of the qualifying rating was June 1, 2012, and the date of commencement of the award was August 2, 2023. Based on section 3.401(b), the effective date is the latest of these dates, which in this case would be August 2, 2023, and therefore, an earlier effective date prior to this time is not possible in this case. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's argument that an earlier effective date of the minor child's birthdate should be provided due to his submittal of an Intent to File (ITF) Form, followed by a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim application, both received on June 9, 2023, in an attempt to apply the COVID 19 delay policy. However, the Board is not persuaded by this argument, as VA regulations prohibit ITF to be used for dependency claims, as well as the use of the VA Form  20-0995 Supplemental Claim applications only being used for previously adjudicated claims, which is not the case here. Therefore, the Board cannot use these forms to support an earlier effective date. Moreover, the COVID 19 delay policy ended on June 10, 2023, with the Veteran first submitting a claim and making VA aware of K.J's existence on August 2, 2023, and therefore, this policy does not apply. 

As such, an earlier effective date for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's minor child, K.J., is not warranted; and the claim is denied.
