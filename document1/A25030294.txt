ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of June 21, 2011, for the award of 50 percent rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis with right foot plantar rupture at the right 2nd metatarsal phalangeal joint, associated with osteoarthritis of right great toe, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral foot disabilities derived from the issue of entitlement to a higher rating for service-connected osteoarthritis of the right great toe, which was continuously prosecuted and remained pending at the time the claim of entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis was developed and granted.

2. The most probative evidence shows that the bilateral plantar fasciitis manifesting in symptoms of pain on manipulation, pain on use of the feet, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, which were not improved by orthopedic shoe or appliance, was present at the time the June 2011 claim was filed for entitlement to service connection for residuals of right toe injury.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of June 21, 2011, for the award of 50 percent rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis with right foot plantar rupture at the right 2nd metatarsal phalangeal joint, associated with osteoarthritis of the right great toe, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5276 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1987 to September 1991. This appeal to the Board of Veteran's Appeal (Board) arose from a November 2022 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claim file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 21, 2018, for the award of 50 percent rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

An exception to this rule provides that the effective date of an award of increased disability compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred, if the claim is received within one year from such date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); see also Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997) (When considering the appropriate effective date for an increased rating, VA must consider the evidence of disability during the period one year prior to the application).

In this matter, the Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date for the award of 50 percent rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis. The current effective date assigned is December 21, 2018, the date of receipt of the Intent to File.

Turning now to the relevant procedural history in this matter, in June 2011, the Veteran filed a claim, specifically a request to reopen the previously denied issue of entitlement to service connection for residuals of right toe injury. See June 2011 VA Form 21-526b (Veteran Supplemental Claim). In April 2012, the AOJ denied reopening the claim. See April 2012 Rating Decision - Narrative. 

In August 2012, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) pertaining to that denial. Based on the receipt of new and material evidence, in November 2013, the AOJ awarded entitlement to service connection for osteoarthritis of right great toe from June 21, 2011. See November 2013 Rating Decision - Narrative. In January 2014, the Veteran filed a NOD. In the NOD, the Veteran indicated that he had additional foot disabilities associated with in-service right toe injury. He also was appealing the initial rating assigned for osteoarthritis of the right great toe. In May 2014, the AOJ awarded entitlement to service connection for hammertoes on the right foot, and denied other foot related disabilities, to include left foot disability, tenderness in right heel, right foot corns, and bunions. See May 2014 Rating Decision - Narrative. In June 2014, the Veteran filed a NOD.

In January 2016, the AOJ awarded entitlement to service connection for hallus rigidus and hallux valgus. See January 2016 Rating Decision - Narrative. In March 2017, an earlier effective date of June 21, 2011, was awarded for the grant of service connection of hallux rigidus and hallux valgus. See March 2017 Rating Decision - Narrative

In October 2018, the Board denied entitlement to service connection for right foot corns and right heel tenderness. It awarded entitlement to service connection for right foot Morton's neuroma and metatarsalgia. The Board also remanded entitlement to an increased rating for osteoarthritis of right great toe and entitlement to service connection for left foot disability for further evidentiary development. See October 2018 BVA Decision.

In December 2018, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File. In September 2019, the AOJ granted an effective date of June 21, 2011, for the award of service connection for bilateral Morton's neuroma and metatarsalgia. The AOJ also awarded entitlement to service connection for left foot plantar fasciitis from June 21, 2011, assigning an initial 20 percent rating. See September 2019 Rating Decision - Narrative.

In October 2019, the Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, pertaining to the October 2018 Board decision's denial of entitlement to service connection for right heel tenderness. In January 2020, the AOJ awarded entitlement to service connection for right foot plantar fasciitis, assigning an initial 30 percent rating effective from December 21, 2018. See January 2020 Rating Decision - Narrative. In October 2020, the Veteran submitted a request for Higher-Level Review, VA Form 20-0996, of the January 2020 rating decision.

In April 2020, the Board remanded the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for osteoarthritis of the right great toe. In December 2020, the Board denied entitlement to an increased rating for osteoarthritis of the right great toe. See December 2020 Remand BVA or CAVC (BVA Decision).

In February 2021, the AOJ found that it committed clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in separately evaluating right foot and left foot plantar fasciitis. In the decision, the AOJ recharacterized the disability as bilateral plantar fasciitis, and assigned a 50 percent rating from December 21, 2018. 

Also, in October 2019, the Veteran also submitted a VA Form 21- 526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), indicating that he was seeking entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis of the right foot. He also expressed seeking entitlement to service connection for another foot disability and an increased rating for his hammertoes. In July 2021, the AOJ continued the 50 percent rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis. In September 2021, based on new evidence, the AOJ stated that in the July 2021 rating decision, it inadvertently omitted a diagnosis provided during the July 2021 VA examination. It included the diagnosis of right foot plantar plate rupture at the 2nd metatarsal phalangeal joint and bilateral Morton's neuroma with the bilateral plantar fasciitis. It indicated that it had increased the rating from 10 percent to 50 percent from December 21, 2018. 

The Board clarifies that in the September 2021 rating decision, the AOJ combined the bilateral plantar fasciitis and bilateral Morton's neuroma. Initially, the bilateral Morton's neuroma was evaluated separately and assigned a 10 percent rating prior to the September 2021 rating decision. 

In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a request for Higher-Level Review of the September 2021 rating decision, pertaining to the effective date assigned for the 50 percent rating. In the November 2022 rating decision, subject to this appeal, the AOJ denied entitlement to an earlier effective date. The AOJ also indicated that it committed CUE in combining the evaluation of bilateral plantar fasciitis and bilateral Morton's neuroma and returned to rating them separately. See November 2022 Rating Decision.

In the January 2020 rating decision, the AOJ referenced the October 2019 Supplemental Claim Application, which specified the issue to be chronic heel strain, right foot, and notes the October 2018 Board decision. This is the decision in which entitlement to service connection for right plantar fasciitis was granted. The Board clarifies that the January 2020 decision was not based on the claim filed on the October 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

The October 2018 Board Decision would be considered a Legacy decision, as the Veteran did not opt into the AMA through the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP), a program allowing Veterans to appeal in the AMA system before its implementation. The decision arose from an appeal through the Legacy appeal system. It appears that the AOJ construed the October 2019 Supplemental Claim Application as a request to reopen, as stated in the beginning of the January 2020 rating decision.

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC or Court) has held that when a claim is reopened, the effective date cannot be earlier than the date of the claim to reopen. Juarez v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 537, 539-40 (2008) (citing Bingham v. Nicholson, 421 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2005); Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d 1333, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2005); Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332, 340 (1995)).

The Board also notes that an initial claim for an increased rating on VA Form 21-526EZ cannot establish continuous pursuit, regardless of whether it was received within one year of the issuance of the prior VA decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h)(1). However, the Board notes that in the October 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran was not at the time seeking a higher rating for plantar fasciitis, as it had not been yet granted.

The Board understands that the procedural history in this matter pertaining to the claim at issue is complicated. The Board does find that when the Veteran filed a claim seeking entitlement to "residuals of right toe injury" in June 2011, that it encompassed any and all disabilities that were related to such injury. The first disability that was granted based on the finding of a nexus between it and the in-service right toe injury was osteoarthritis of the right great toe. Throughout the appeal, other foot and toe disabilities were granted based on them being associated, or secondary, to the osteoarthritis of the right great toe.

Since the grant of entitlement to service connection for right great toe osteoarthritis, the Veteran continuously pursued a higher rating for the disability and other disabilities either associated with the service-connected disability or in-service injury. The Board takes note of findings made by the AOJ in the September 2019 rating decision, which awarded entitlement to service connection for left foot plantar fasciitis. The AOJ stated that it was assigning a 20 percent rating from June 21, 2011, the date of service connection for osteoarthritis of the right great toe based on continuous prosecution, although a claim for entitlement to service connection for chronic left foot disability, as secondary to right great toe injury, was filed in February 2013. The AOJ noted that the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's left foot disability, plantar fasciitis, was related to his osteoarthritis of the right great toe.  See September 2019 Rating Decision - Narrative.

The Board denied entitlement to a higher rating for osteoarthritis of right great toe in December 2020. Again, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for right foot plantar fasciitis in January 2020. The Veteran timely appealed the effective date assigned for the disability in October 2020. The Board reminds that the October 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ does not include the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for osteoarthritis of the right great toe. So, at the time of the award of service connection for right foot plantar fasciitis, the increased rating claim for osteoarthritis of the right great toe was pending, i.e., had not been decided. 

An increased rating claim can reasonably raise a claim for secondary service connection. Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188 (2021). The Court has also held that VA is obligated to develop and adjudicate claims for secondary service connection that are reasonably raised during evaluation of a primary disability and are logically related to the claim on appeal even when no formal claim has been filed. See Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 103 (2022).

Again, it was opined that his right foot plantar fasciitis was associated with his service-connected osteoarthritis of the right great toe. It can be argued that any claim pertaining to the Veteran's right foot disability was derived from, part and parcel of, or a component of, the claim pertaining to a higher rating for osteoarthritis of the right great toe. Per Wilson, a formal claim would not need to be filed. The evidence developed for the claim indicated the presence of foot disabilities.

As the increased rating claim for right great toe was, at that time, pending from the date of award for service connection, an effective date of June 21, 2011, could be available for bilateral plantar fasciitis. Again, the appropriate effective date is the date of claim, which in this case would be June 21, 2011, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Board notes that the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended, effective February 7, 2021. From February 7, 2021, plantar fasciitis has its own diagnostic code, 5269. Prior to the amendments, plantar fasciitis could be rated under DC 5276 which evaluates flatfoot.

The Veteran's plantar fasciitis is evaluated under DC 5276. A 50 percent rating is warranted where the bilateral condition is pronounced; marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo achillis on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances.

The Board notes that the conjunctive form is not specifically employed in the enumeration of rating criteria under DC 5276; therefore, it is not required that all the manifestations that are listed be shown. See Dyess v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 448 (1991); see also Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 366 (2007) (the cases in which the CAVC has indicated that 38 C.F.R. § 4.21 applies are those in which the diagnostic criteria are not clearly joined in the conjunctive).

The Board notes that initially, the AOJ assigned a 20 percent rating under DC 5276. The AOJ stated that the evidence showed that the Veteran experienced symptoms of pain on manipulation of the feet, accentuated, pain on use of the feet, accentuated, and symptoms not improved by orthopedic shoe or appliance. See September 2019 Rating Decision - Narrative. 

The medical evidence also shows that plantar fasciitis of the right foot was present at the same time as the left foot, and he experienced similar or more severe symptoms for his right foot. The May 2014 VA examination report indicated that bilateral foot pain was either Morton's neuroma or plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis was reported for both feet at the September 2015 VA examination. The Veteran has reported tenderness of his right heel during the appeal period. Extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces is a symptom contemplative of the 50 percent rating. The Veteran has also reported the onset of the symptoms since the injury to the right great toe. Accordingly, resolving any reasonable doubt, the Board finds that bilateral plantar fasciitis, manifesting in severity contemplative of the 50 percent rating under DC 5276, was present at the time of the filing of the June 2011 claim. 

Therefore, entitlement to an effective date of June 21, 2011, for the award of 50 percent rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis, is granted.
