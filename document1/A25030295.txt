ORDER

An initial compensable disability rating for hypertension is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran does not have diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more. Additionally, while the Veteran does require continuous medication for control of his hypertension, he does not have a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial compensable rating for hypertension are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.10, 4.100, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101; McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267 (2016).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty service from October 1992 to August 1995.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the June 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

VA's percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of service-connected disability.  38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §?4.1.  If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38?C.F.R. §?4.7.  All reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38?C.F.R. §?4.3. 

This decision will focus on the evidence pertinent to the rating criteria and disability severity during the relevant period on appeal, but the Board has considered the entire record to have a full picture of the disability.  See 38?C.F.R. §§?4.1, 4.2, 4.41; Gonzales v. West, 218 F. 3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

Initial increased rating for hypertension

The Veteran contends that the initial rating of zero percent for hypertension should be increased. See March 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). 

As indicated above in the Conclusions of Law section, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an initial compensable rating for hypertension. Accordingly, the Board denies the Veteran's claim.

In support of this determination, the Board first notes that the Veteran's service-connected hypertension has been assigned an initial noncompensable rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. Under Diagnostic Code 7101, a compensable rating is assignable when either of 3 criteria are satisfied: (1) when diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more; (2) systolic pressure is predominantly 160 or more; or (3) an individual has a history of diastolic pressure of predominantly 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

In McCarroll v. McDonald, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) interpreted Diagnostic Code 7101 and clarified its application in the increased rating context. 28 Vet. App. 267, 272 (2016). The Court first stated that the criteria for compensable ratings under Diagnostic Code 7101 "contemplate two factual alternatives[:]" (1) a veteran whose blood pressure is currently controlled by medication, but who has a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, is entitled to the minimum compensable rating of 10 percent; or (2) if the blood pressure is not controlled by medication, the actual blood pressure level determines the disability rating from 20 to 60 percent. Id. The Court then specified that a finding of "predominantly 100 or more" may not be substantiated by merely one diastolic pressure reading of 100. Id. at 274.

The Board first notes that the Veteran's hypertension is controlled by continuous medication. See May 2023 VA Examination Report. As the Veteran's hypertension is controlled by continuous medication, the only avenue for the Veteran to receive a compensable, 10 percent rating is if the evidence of record demonstrates a history of diastolic pressure of predominantly 100 or more. See McCarroll, 28 Vet. App. at 272 (2016). 

The Board reviewed the Veteran's blood pressure readings on record as well as his readings while in-service but did not find any instance where the diastolic pressure was 100 or more. The most current of his highest blood pressure readings were in May 2023: 148/90, 148/92, and 150/95. See May 2023 VA Examination Report. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was on prescription medication at the time these readings were taken. However, the use of medication is contemplated by the pertinent rating criteria. There are no other relevant medical records submitted within the evidence window for the Board to consider. Accordingly, at this time, the Board may not conclude that the Veteran has a history of diastolic pressure of predominantly 100 or more.

As the Veteran does not have a history of diastolic pressure of predominantly 100 or more and his hypertension is controlled through the use of continuous medication, which is contemplated by diagnostic code 7101, the Board finds that entitlement to an initial compensable rating is not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. Thus, the Veteran's claim is denied.

The Board is grateful for the Veteran's honorable service and regrets that a more favorable outcome could not be reached.
