DOCKET NO. 230725-364799
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not report to an examination for her TDIU claim and did not provide good cause for her failure to attend to the examination.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Entitlement to a TDIU is denied as a matter of law. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.155(a), 3.655 (a), (b).

INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 2007 to December 2007. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on an appeal from a July 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the AOJ.

The Veteran filed a July 2023, VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, and elected the Direct Review docket. As the appellant has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issues on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301. The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The appellant has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. The appellant is welcome to file a supplemental claim to have this evidence considered. Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

1. Entitlement to a TDIU

The Veteran contends that the symptoms due to her service-connected disabilities are severe enough that they prohibit her from maintaining employment. See March 2023 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155. Total disability is considered to exist when there is any impairment which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(1). Total disability may or may not be permanent. Id. Total ratings are authorized for any disability or combination of disabilities for which the Rating Schedule prescribes a 100 percent evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(2). 

A TDIU may be assigned when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). If there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, with sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. 

For the period of appeal, the Veteran was service connected for PTSD with a TBI rated at 70 percent, effective May 26, 2020, migraine headaches, rated at 50 percent, effective September 23, 2019, and a chronic right knee strain, rated at 10 percent, effective December 21, 2007, for a combined disability rating of 90 percent, effective September 23, 2019. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.25, 4.26. Therefore, during the period of appeal the Veteran met the schedular TDIU requirements. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

Entitlement to a total rating must be based solely on the impact of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities on his ability to keep and maintain substantially gainful employment. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). For VA purposes, the term "unemployability" is synonymous with an inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. VAOPGPREC 75-91; 57 Fed. Reg. 2317 (1992). 

The Veteran contends that her PTSD with TBI, migraine headaches and knee condition prevented her from maintaining employment. See March 2023 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability (TDIU application). She reported that she was in therapy and was going to be prescribed medication in the upcoming weeks. See March 2023 Correspondence. She stated that she was unable to work due to her panic attacks, severe depression, migraines, nightmares, confusion and explosive irritability. She stated that she was fired from her last two jobs due to missing work due to PTSD. Id. 

While the record supports the Veteran's service-connected disabilities caused some impairment, it is unclear to the Board whether her disabilities impacted her functional ability severely enough to preclude substantially gainful employment. In her March 2023 TDIU application, she stated that she was most recently employed from October 2021 to February 2023 as a social worker working 40 hours a week. See March 2023 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. Prior to that, she was employed as a social worker for two other companies from September 2019 to March 2020 and October 2020 to October 2021. While there was a gap in her employment between March 2020 and October 2020, she was able to maintain employment consistently from October 2020 to February 2023. She reported being fired from her most recent employment due to missing work as a result of her PSTD. Id. 

In an April 2023 response from her most recent employer, the employer confirmed the Veteran was employed as a social worker from October 2021 through February 2023, working 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week.  See April 2023 Request for Employment Information. The Veteran missed approximately 22 days of work in the preceding 12 months and was terminated due to the Veteran's abandonment of her employment. Id. 

The Board acknowledges that the record contains an August 2020 VA medical opinion that states the Veteran's TBI and migraine headaches caused significant occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. See August 2020 VA Examination. In addition, the examiner stated that the Veteran had not been able to do any sedentary work due to blurred vision and debilitating migraines and had recently lost her part-time job due to her disabilities. Id. However, subsequent to the August 2020 VA medical opinion, this opinion was obtained during a previous claim for a TDIU, which was denied in a February 2021 rating decision. After the examination, the Veteran obtained and maintained employment as a social worker from October 2020 through February 2023. See March 2023 TDIU Application. In addition, her current disability rating has been in effect since September 23, 2019, indicating that she was able to obtain and maintain employment despite her current symptomology. See July 2023 Rating Codesheet. She has not provided any lay or medical evidence suggesting her symptoms have increased in severity that would now result in her inability to maintain employment. 

The Veteran was scheduled for VA examinations in conjunction with her claim for entitlement to a TDIU. See June 2023 VA Examinations. However, the Veteran failed to attend the appointments and did not contact VA to provide an explanation for why she did not attend the appointments nor did she request to have the examinations rescheduled. See June 2023 VA Examinations.

A claim for a TDIU is a form of a claim for increased rating. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.655, when entitlement to a benefit cannot be established or confirmed without a current VA examination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for an examination scheduled in connection for a claim for an increased rating, the claim shall be denied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a), (b).

The Board acknowledges the decision in Turk v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 565 (2008), which held when a veteran fails to appear for an examination, the Board must consider (1) whether the examination was necessary to decide the claim and (2) whether the veteran had good cause to miss the examination. The CAVC specifically made a finding in Turk, however, that the case at issue was an initial claim for benefits, and not a claim for an increased rating. See Turk, 21 Vet. App. at 568-570. It stated, "Thus, § 3.655(b) creates a distinction between original compensation claims, which are rated on the evidence of record, and other classes of claims, which are summarily denied." Id. at 569.

Therefore, the Board finds the Veteran failed to appear to her scheduled VA examination without good cause in connection with her claim for TDIU and the matter must be denied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).
