ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for a respiratory condition, also referred to as shortness of breath, is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a fatigue condition, to include as undiagnosed illness, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The persuasive evidence of record does not show the Veteran suffers from bilateral hearing loss for VA compensation purposes.

2. The Veteran's respiratory condition has not manifested to at least a FEV-1 of 71 to 80 percent, or; FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent, or need for intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1131, 1132, 1153, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

2. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for a respiratory condition, also referred to as shortness of breath, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6602.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from April 1994 to June 1997. 

In May 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal for the claim of entitlement to service connection for fatigue, the August 2023 AOJ decision on appeal for increased rating for shortness of breath, and the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence.

Regarding the issue of service connection for a fatigue condition, the Board notes that the June 2023 rating decision did not explicitly find that new and relevant evidence had been submitted sufficient to readjudicate the Veteran's previously denied claim for service connection for fatigue.  However, in that rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) essentially adjudicated the issue on the merits.  By reaching the merits of the Veteran's service connection claim, the RO effectively found that new and relevant evidence had in fact been submitted sufficient to readjudicate the claim for service connection for fatigue.  This constitutes a favorable finding by the AOJ that is binding on the Board.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c) (reflecting that favorable findings made by VA adjudicators are binding on all subsequent VA adjudicators, absent clear and unmistakable error).  The Board will therefore address the merits of the case without consideration of whether new and relevant evidence is required to readjudicate the previously denied claim.

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  In order to establish service connection, the record must show competent evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d, 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

When considering such a claim for service connection, the Board must consider on a case-by-case basis, the competence and sufficiency of lay evidence offered to support a finding of service connection.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 Fed. Cir. 2007)).  The mere conclusory or generalized lay statements that a service event or illness caused a current disability are insufficient.  Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (2010).  

For the chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), including sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus (as organic diseases of the nervous system), service connection may alternatively be established with evidence of chronicity of the disease during service or during a presumptive period following service separation, or by showing a continuity of symptoms after service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012); see Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).  When chronicity or continuity is established, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, no matter how remote in time from the period of service, will be service connected unless clearly attributable to causes unrelated to service ("intercurrent" causes).  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). 

Entitlement to Service Connection: Hearing Loss 

The Veteran contends that her bilateral hearing loss is related to her active-duty service.

For the purpose of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing is considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory threshold for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 Hertz is 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 (a), an examination for hearing impairment for VA purposes must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a pure tone audiometry test.

Here, the medical evidence does not reflect the Veteran has a bilateral hearing loss disability.  In July 2023, the Veteran attended a VA examination.  On this audiological evaluation, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT EAR	15	20	20	20	35

LEFT EAR	20	20	25	20	25

In addition, speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in the right ear and 94 percent in the left ear.  The examiner did diagnose the Veteran with hearing loss in frequencies 6000 Hertz (Hz) or higher in the left ear, and hearing loss in the 500-4000 Hz and 6000 Hz in the right ear. 

The Board acknowledges that the July 2023 examiner diagnosed the Veteran with sensorineural hearing loss and opined it was related to the Veteran's active-duty service.  However, the audiological testing still showed the Veteran did not meet the criteria for hearing loss for VA purposes.  The Veteran did not have an auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 Hertz of 40 decibels or greater; or auditory threshold for at least three of the frequencies of 26 decibels or greater; or a speech recognition score of less than 94 percent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.   

The Veteran has provided no other records that show she currently suffers from bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes.  The Board acknowledges that the Court has previously held that the requirement that a claimant have a current disability before service connection may be awarded for that disability is also satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim, even if no disability is present at the time of the claim's adjudication.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).  In this case, however, the record does not reflect the Veteran has had a hearing loss disability as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 or otherwise, at any time during the pendency of this case.   

Thus, the Board concludes that the persuasive evidence of record is against the claim and the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The Board determines the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his/her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, and the assigned rating is based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairment of earning capacity in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.10.  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings should be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  However, the evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

Entitlement to a Compensable Rating: Respiratory Condition

The Veteran's respiratory condition is currently rated as non-compensable under Diagnostic Code (DC) 6602 for Bronchial Asthma.

Under DC 6602, a 10 percent rating is assigned for an FEV-1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second) less of 71 to 80 percent, or; FEV-1/FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) of 71 to 80 percent, or; intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for an FEV-1 of 56 to 70 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or when asthma requires daily inhalation or oral bronchodilator therapy, or daily inhalational anti-inflammatory medication.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6602.

A 60 percent evaluation is assigned for an FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or when there are at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or when intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids are prescribed.  And a 100 percent rating is assigned when pulmonary function tests (PFT's) show an FEV-1 less than 40 percent of predicted value, or FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, or when asthma requires daily use of systemic (oral or parenteral) high dose corticosteroids or immuno-suppressive medications.  Id.

The Board notes that the Veteran's diagnosed condition of "shortness of breath" is not listed in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities, and therefore, the Diagnostic Code that most closely resembles her symptoms has been assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.

In March 2023, the Veteran attended a VA examination.  The Veteran reported her initial symptoms were wheezing and shortness of breath.  She stated she has not received treatment for her condition and will just sit down to catch her breath.  She reported her current symptoms as congestion.  The Veteran did not require use of oral or parenteral corticosteroid medication, inhaled medications, or oral bronchodilators.  She further did not require antibiotics or outpatient oxygen therapy.  Pulmonary functions tests (PFTs) were performed.  The Veteran's pre-bronchodilator results were FVC of 96 percent predicted, FEV-1 of 101 percent predicted, and FEV-1/FVC of 83 percent.  The examiner noted that the FEV-1 results were the most accurate.  Post-bronchodilator testing was not performed because the pre-bronchodilator results were normal.  Diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) for carbon monoxide by the single breath testing was not completed because it was not indicated for the Veteran's condition.  The Veteran did not have any other significant findings. 

After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds a compensable rating is not warranted.  The Veteran at no time has had a FEV-1 of 71 to 80 percent or lower, or a FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 or lower.  Further, the Veteran has not required any use of medications, to include intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy.  In fact, the Veteran herself reported not receiving any treatment and only needing to sit and catch her breath when symptoms occur.  The Veteran has further required no oxygen therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications, or monthly visits with a physician for required care of exacerbations.  Lastly, the examiner also found the Veteran's PFT results were normal.  Thus, the Veteran does not meet the requirements for a 10 percent, 30 percent, 60 percent, or 100 percent rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6602.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertions and statements that she is entitled to a higher rating because her symptoms are worse.  The Board recognizes that lay persons are competent to provide medical opinions on some medical issues.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  However, the Board has considered the Veteran's statements and finds them credible and consistent with the rating assigned.

Accordingly, the Board concludes that a compensable rating for a respiratory condition is not warranted.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Although the Board regrets further delay, additional development is required prior to adjudication of the Veteran's remaining claim. 

Entitlement to Service Connection: Fatigue

The issue is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the June 2023 rating decision on appeal.  

The Board finds the March 2023 VA opinion is inadequate to fairly adjudicate the claim.  First, the examiner in the examination stated the Veteran's condition had a known etiology but then provided no explanation of what the etiology is.  The examiner later noted that the Veteran's in-service fatigue was a symptom of anemia.  However, the examiner did not provide whether anemia is the current etiology of the Veteran's fatigue.  Further, if the Veteran's current fatigue is related to anemia, and since anemia was noted on the Veteran's May 1997 separation examination, then an examination to determine if anemia is present with an opinion on whether it is related to her active-duty service should have been provided.  Additionally, the examiner only provided an opinion on whether the Veteran's condition was related to toxic exposures, and did not provide an opinion on whether any fatigue condition, or related fatigue condition, is directly related to her in-service complaints.  Lastly, it does not appear the examiner considered chronicity of symptoms.  The Board notes the evidence of record shows the Veteran first claimed chronic fatigue in 1999, only two years after her service, and has continued to contend she suffers from chronic fatigue since. 

Given the above, the Board finds that a remand is required in order to obtain a new examination and opinion addressing the etiology of the claimed condition. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the etiology of the any fatigue condition, to include determining whether any anemia is present.  The record and a copy of this Remand must be made available to the examiner.

Following a review of the entire record, to include the Veteran's lay statements concerning any in-service symptoms, the examiner should opine as to the following:

(a)	Does the Veteran currently suffer from a fatigue-related condition that is a separate and distinct condition, to include anemia?

(b)	IF YES, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's fatigue condition or anemia had its onset during, or is otherwise related to, her active-duty service, to include the multiple complaints of fatigue in April 1997, the notation of anemia on her May 1997 separation examination, as well as her confirmed in-service toxic exposures?

(c)	IF NO, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's fatigue condition is a manifestation of an undiagnosed illness or a diagnosable but medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness of unknown etiology?

In offering any opinion, the examiner must consider the full record, to include the lay statements regarding in-service incurrence, and the opinion should reflect such consideration, to include consideration of chronicity of symptoms since service.  A clearly stated rationale for any opinion offered should be provided and must not be based solely on the lack of any in-service records. 

If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she should explain whether the inability is due to the limits of the examiner's medical knowledge, medical knowledge in general or there is evidence that, if obtained, would permit the opinion to be provided.
