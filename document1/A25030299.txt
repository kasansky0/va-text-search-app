REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1978 to February 1980 and from May 1982 to January 1985.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2019 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the October 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the hearing docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date of the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the date of the Board hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

At the outset, the Board notes that counsel has argued that an earlier effective is warranted for the award of service connection for migraine headaches.  The December 2019 rating decision on appeal did not assign an effective date for migraines, rather, it continued the 50 percent rating.  Thus, the claim for an earlier effective date of migraines is not before the Board and will not be addressed herein.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 100 percent for atrial fibrillation, claimed as extreme high heart rate.

The Veteran was first granted service connection for atrial fibrillation in a December 2011 rating decision.  At that time the Veteran was granted a 100 percent rating.  On October 17, 2019 the Veteran submitted a claim for extreme high heart rhythm.  In a December 2019 decision the RO continued the 100 percent evaluation for atrial fibrillation.

The Veteran's atrial fibrillation is rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart (General Rating Formula).  Pursuant to that formula, a 30 percent rating is assigned for a workload of 5.1-7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms; or evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multi-gated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging).  A 60 percent rating is assigned for a workload of 3.1 to 5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms.  A 100 percent rating is assigned for a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, General Rating Formula.  Heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope.  Id., Note (3).  

For the entirety of the appeal period the Veteran has been assigned a 100 percent rating for atrial fibrillation.  As noted, a 100 percent rating is the maximum schedular rating for atrial fibrillation under the General Rating Formula.  As such, the highest rating has been awarded for the Veteran's atrial fibrillation for the entire appeal period.  There are no other Diagnostic Codes that are applicable. See Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337 (2015); see Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993).  As the Veteran is at the maximum schedular rating for atrial fibrillation (100 percent), there is no legal basis upon which to award a higher schedular rating at any time during the period on appeal.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for migraines, claimed as halo headaches, formerly rated as chronic intermittent ophthalmologic headaches secondary to radiation exposure.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim Application, that was received in October 2019.  He noted halo headaches as an issue he wished to be considered.

Throughout the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's migraine headache disability has been assigned the maximum 50 percent schedular rating under C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.  Since the maximum 50 percent disability rating is assigned for the entirety of the claim period, a higher schedular disability rating cannot be assigned under this diagnostic code.

Additionally, the Board has reviewed the rating schedule and finds that no other diagnostic code provisions are appropriate.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).  

Lastly, the Board notes that there is no evidence in the record that would indicate an extraschedular rating is warranted.  In the November 2024 brief, counsel did not make any contentions that the Veteran's disability picture warranted an extraschedular rating.  Further, the medical evidence of record does not show that the Veteran's migraines represent an exceptional or unusual disability pattern.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.321. 

As such, the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 50 percent for migraine headaches is denied. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of SMC based on the loss of use of a creative organ.

The Veteran contends that earlier effective dates are warranted for the grants of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance and the loss of use of a creative organ.  These were originally granted in the December 2019 rating decision and assigned as of December 22, 2017.

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received by VA within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

The Veteran and counsel have made no arguments as to why an earlier effective date is warranted.  By way of history, the Veteran submitted a notice of intent to file a claim on December 22, 2017.  On October 27, 2018, the Veteran submitted a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, seeking service connection for Parkinson's disease.

In July 2019, the Veteran was awarded service connection for Parkinson's disease.  Several residuals of Parkinson's were also service-connected and several others were deferred.  The awards of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance and loss of use of a creative organ are based on the Veteran's award of service connection for Parkinson's disease and the associated disabilities.  Thus, the earliest possible effective date is the date the intent to file was received on December 22, 2017.  As such, the claims for an earlier effective date for the award of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance and loss of use of a creative organ must be denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to SMC(r)(1) based on the need for special aid and attendance.

Entitlement to SMC(r)(2) based on the need for special aid and attendance.

The Veteran seeks SMC under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1114(r) or (t).  

In regard to the claim of entitlement to SMC(t), the Board notes the Veteran has not been service-connected for a TBI at any point during the appeal period.  As such, the award of SMC under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1114(t) is not applicable.    

SMC(r)(1) is assigned when there is a factual need for special aid and attendance and SMC(r)(2) is assigned when there is a factual need for a higher level of special aid and attendance; as a threshold matter for SMC(r)(1) and SMC(r)(2), the Veteran must be entitled to SMC(o), at the maximum rate authorized under SMC(p), or at the intermediate rate authorized between the rates authorized under SMC(n) and SMC(o) and at the rate authorized under SMC(k).  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(k), 1114(n), 1114(o), 1114(p), 1114(r).  After meeting that threshold requirement, SMC(r)(1) is warranted when the evidence additionally shows that the Veteran is also entitled to aid and attendance on a factual basis and SMC(r)(2) is warranted when the evidence shows that the Veteran needs not only aid and attendance, but a higher level of care (daily care by a licensed professional or someone under the supervision of a licensed professional such that, in the absence of such care, the Veteran would be an inpatient or resident at a hospital or nursing home).  Id.  Further, the existence of the need for such care shall be determined by a physician employed by the Department or, in areas where no such physician is available, by a physician carrying out such function under contract or fee arrangement based on an examination by such physician.  For the purposes of section 1134 of this title, such allowance shall be considered as additional compensation payable for disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(r).  

In this case, the Veteran could possibly be entitled to a higher level of SMC if his impairment due to his Parkinson's Disease symptoms rose to the level of loss of use of extremities. Unfortunately, the evidence of record is inadequate to make that determination as the VA examinations are inadequate.  The October 2019 private examiner notes bilateral resting tremors that interfere with the use of hands and mild muscle rigidity of the lower extremities.  The May 2019 VA examiner noted moderate tremors of the right upper extremity only.  However, the Veteran described tremors that started in his hands and went up his arms, bilaterally, and continued down into his legs.  Lastly, the severity noted by the November 2018 private examiner is incongruous with the other medical evidence of record.  As such, remand is warranted to cure the predecisional duty to assist error to ensure the examination was adequate.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an opinion regarding the severity of the Veteran's bilateral upper and lower extremity symptoms, to include bradykinesia, tremors, and rigidity from December 2017 to December 2019.  

1. The examiner is asked to describe the severity of the Veteran's bilateral upper and lower extremity symptoms.  In determining such severity, the examiner should consider the Veteran's lay assertions as to the severity.  The examiner should describe the symptoms in detail and include the rationale for the conclusion as to the severity of the disabilities.

2. The examiner is additionally asked to opine on whether the Veteran's symptoms equated to functional loss of use of any extremities.
