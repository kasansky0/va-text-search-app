REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 1968 to November 1972, with additional service in the Army National Guard. The Veteran filed an April 12, 2024, Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the rating decisions issued on May 27, 2020, December 18, 2020, May 24, 2022, and September 13, 2022, and selecting the Direct Review docket.

Timeliness of an Appeal

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an appeal consists of a properly completed Notice of Disagreement (NOD, Board Appeal request) on the form prescribed by the Secretary submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(b)(1)(A); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.2500(a)(1), 20.202, 20.203. A question as to the timeliness or adequacy of a Board Appeal request shall be decided by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C). 

An extension of the period for filing Board Appeal request may be granted for good cause. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Id. When an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38?C.F.R. §?3.109(b). Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). 

Examples of good cause may include serious illness or injury of the appellant or representative, or the appellant's inability to access mail services due to homelessness, or overseas deployment. Examples that would not constitute good cause include change in representation, change in preference of a review option at the AOJ or among the Board review options, difficulty in obtaining evidence, or discovery of new evidence during a period in which the duty to assist does not apply. 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 155 (Jan. 18, 2019).   

Timeliness of the April 12, 2024, Board Appeal request with respect to the rating decisions issued on May 27, 2020, December 18, 2020, May 24, 2022, and September 13, 2022.  

On April 12, 2024, the Veteran filed a Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the rating decision issued on May 27, 2020, that denied service connection for hearing loss, the rating decision issued on December 18, 2020, that denied service connection for detached retinas in both eyes, the rating decision issued on May 24, 2022, that denied service connection for PTSD, deviated septum, and sleep disorder, and the rating decision issued on September 13, 2022, that denied an increased rating for tinnitus. The Veteran asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal with respect to each rating decision because it is needed "[t]o allow for a review of filings in progress." See April 12, 2024, VA Form 10182.

For the reasons explained below, the Board concludes that the attempted appeals were not timely and good cause has not been presented to warrant extensions of time to file appeals from the rating decisions issued on May 27, 2020, December 18, 2020, May 24, 2022, and September 13, 2022. 

The rating decision issued on May 27, 2020, denied service connection for hearing loss. The Veteran was notified of the decision in a letter that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letter was sent to the Veteran's address of record and was not returned as undeliverable.

On October 20, 2020, the Veteran submitted an application request to add or remove dependents, and on December 16, 2020, the Veteran attended a VA examination of the eyes. 

The rating decision issued on December 18, 2020, denied service connection for detached retinas in both eyes. The Veteran and his representative were notified of the decision in a letter that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letter was sent to the Veteran's address of record and was not returned as undeliverable.

On August 19, 2021, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File and appointed a different Veterans Service Organization (VSO) representative. On November 10, 2021, the Veteran appointed the original VSO as his representative and submitted his claim for service connection for PTSD, deviated septum, and sleep disorder. On January 2, 2022, the Veteran submitted a statement in support of his PTSD claim. He also attended several VA examinations in January and February of 2022. 

On March 25, 2022, VA sent the Veteran a letter informing him that he may experience a delay in receipt of correspondence from VA because VA experienced delays in printing and mailing correspondence to Veterans and claimants due to supply chain and staffing shortages from a vendor. More specifically, the letter stated that from July 13, 2021, though December 31, 2021, correspondence may not have been received timely. As a result, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) would extend the time for a response to any correspondence sent during this time by 90 days unless the Veteran waived his right to respond or sent the requested evidence or information. 

The rating decision issued on May 24, 2022, denied service connection for PTSD, deviated septum, and sleep disorder. The Veteran and his representative were notified of the decision in a letter that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letter was sent to the Veteran's address of record and was not returned as undeliverable.

On May 27, 2022, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for tinnitus. 

The rating decision issued on September 13, 2022, denied an increased rating for tinnitus. The Veteran and his representative were notified of the decision in a letter that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letter was sent to the Veteran's address of record and was not returned as undeliverable.

On January 9, 2024, the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for adjustment disorder, submitted a private Disability Benefits Questionnaire, and appointed a different VSO as his representative. He submitted an intent to file a claim on January 12, 2024.

The Veteran's April 12, 2024, Board Appeal request was not timely filed because it was received more than one year after the rating decisions issued on May 27, 2020, December 18, 2020, May 24, 2022, and September 13, 2022. While the Veteran was notified in March 2022 that there may have been a delay in receipt of mail, a review of the record does not show that the relevant rating decisions or notification thereof were issued during the period identified in the letter. Further, the record does not show, and the Veteran has not asserted, that notification of these rating decisions was not received.

Instead, the Veteran asserts that there is good cause to extend the time to file an appeal from each of the above rating decisions because he needed time to review "filings in progress." As noted above, the Veteran filed other documents and attended examinations within the one-year appeal periods for the March 2020, December 2020, and May 2022 rating decisions. While he did not appear to file any claims or attend examinations within the one-year period after the September 2022 rating decision, he filed additional documents in January 2024, prior to the April 2024 Board Appeal request. The Veteran did not provide an explanation for why he could not have filed his Board Appeal request within the one-year appeal periods following each rating decision, nor has he explained why he was unable to file his NOD earlier than he did.

Accordingly, the April 12, 2024, Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to the rating decision issued on May 27, 2020, that denied service connection for hearing loss, the rating decision issued on December 18, 2020, that denied service connection for detached retinas in both eyes, the rating decision issued on May 24, 2022, that denied service connection for PTSD, deviated septum, and sleep disorder, and the rating decision issued on September 13, 2022, that denied an increased rating for tinnitus, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. The extension requests are denied and the attempted appeals are dismissed.
