DOCKET NO. 230109-311528
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) has been withdrawn.

FINDING OF FACT

On February 28, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to a TDIU by the Veteran's attorney have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the U.S. Army from May 1969 to May 1971. 

In the January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  On February 28, 2025, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.  

Withdrawal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.205(b)(1).

?

In the present case, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  In a February 2025 statement, which included the Veteran' name and file number, his representative indicated that he wanted to cancel the scheduled hearing, as he was satisfied with his ratings and no longer wished to purse the appeal.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
