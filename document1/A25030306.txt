ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of February 26, 2018, for the grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis is granted.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran filed an intent to file that was received by VA on February 26, 2018.

2. A November 2, 2018, rating decision denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for limited mobility of the left leg due, in part, to a lack of inservice event or current disability.  

3. The November 2, 2018, rating decision which denied service connection for limited mobility of the left leg is final.

4. VA received a line of duty determination in February 2022 documenting a left leg and left knee injury.

5. The November 2022 grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis was based in part on the line of duty determination received in February 2022.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of February 26, 2018, for the grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis are met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110, 38 U.S.C. § 5107, 5108, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2000 to March 2002; and in September 2004.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The appeal is granted.

Law

In general, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

When a claim is denied and the claimant fails to initiate and perfect a timely appeal, the decision denying the claim becomes final.  Dolan v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 358, 361 (1996).  Once a claim has been finally decided and disallowed, it will not be reopened unless upon the submission or receipt of new and material evidence.  38 USC § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156.  Generally, when benefits are granted based on the submission of new and material evidence, the effective date of the grant is the later of the date of receipt of the claim to reopen or the date entitlement arose.  38 C.F.R. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(1). 

Section 3.156 provides a limited exception to the general rule of finality insofar as it provides that a previously denied claim must be reopened and reconsidered "if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1).  It further provides that if a claim is reconsidered and an award is made based "all or in part" on the previously unassociated records, the effective date of the award is to be the later of the date on which entitlement arose or the date on which the previously decided claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3).  However, the requirement to previously reconsider a previously decided claim applies only if the service department records existed and could have been obtained at the time of the original decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(2); see also 70 Fed. Reg. 35,388, 35,389 (June 20, 2005) (explaining that reconsideration requirement is premised on the idea "that a claimant should not be harmed by an administrative deficiency of the government").

To the extent the evidence is found in "approximate balance," the Board will afford the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed, Cir. 2021) (holding that exact equipoise is not required for the benefit of the doubt to be applied, but rather the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal").

Facts

The Veteran's intent to file a claim was received by VA on February 26, 2018.  This is the earliest intent to file on record.  He subsequently submitted a claim for service connection for limited mobility of the left leg in a claim received by VA on February 27, 2018.  

The claim was denied in a November 2018 rating decision, and the Veteran did not appeal or submit new and material evidence within a year of the decision.  The decision became final.  

The Veteran filed a claim to reopen in December 2021.  In an April 2022 request for application letter, the Veteran was told that he needed to file his claim to reopen on the proper form.  In the introduction of the July 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was notified that since he did not file the application on the proper form, no decision would be made. 

In February 2022, the VA received a July 12, 2005, line of duty investigation report indicating the Veteran injured his left leg and left knee. 

The Veteran filed an intent to file on September 15, 2022, and a supplemental claim for service connection for his left knee on November 1, 2022.  The Veteran was granted service connection in a November 2022 rating decision.  The rating decision indicated that the Veteran's grant was based on a June 2022 VA positive nexus opinion and the Veteran's notation on his 2002 separation examination that he had knee trouble, swollen and painful joints, and needed corrective braces.  The effective date of the grant was September 15, 2022, the date associated with the September 15, 2022, intent to file.

The November 2022 rating decision acknowledges receipt of the line of duty investigation report received in February 2022, then again in November 2022. 

The Veteran submitted an August 25, 2023, VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review, requesting an earlier effective date.  The Veteran's representative argued that at the time of the November 2018 rating decision that previously denied service connection for limited left leg mobility, the Veteran's line of duty determination was not associated with his file.  Thus, the addition of the service department records entitled the Veteran to an earlier effective date. 

In the September 2023 decision on appeal, the RO granted the Veteran an earlier effective date of December 31, 2021.  It found the December 31, 2021, claim for the left knee could be considered a new claim and not a claim to reopen because it was a claim for a new condition, left knee instead of left leg mobility.  Thus, the claim was still pending, and an earlier effective date was warranted. 

Analysis 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for the left knee arthritis disability based on the line of duty determination added to the claims file in February 2022.  The RO indicated in the decision on appeal that this line of duty determination was not a service department record within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1).  

However, an earlier effective date is warranted.  The Board finds the line of duty determination is a service department record within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1).   As indicated on the November 2022 decision that granted service connection, VA received the line of duty determination, and it was relevant to the claim because it indicated the Veteran had an inservice injury to his left knee.  The record is dated July 2005 which confirms this record existed at the time of the November 2018 denial.  

Further, the Board finds the November 2022 grant of service connection was based, at least "in part" on the addition of this evidence.  The prior November 2018 rating decision was based on a lack of diagnosis and a lack of inservice event.  The line of duty determination submitted in February 2022 was evidence of an inservice event and it was listed as evidence by the RO in the November 2022 decision that granted service connection.

Based on these facts, the Board cannot find the evidence persuasively weighs against the November 2022 service connection grant being based in part on the line of duty determination added to the claims file.  Accordingly, an earlier effective date consistent with the February 26, 2018, intent to file is warranted.
