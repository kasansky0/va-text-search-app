ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The competing evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's current tinnitus is the result of his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from June 2016 to May 2017 with additional periods of National Guard service.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran filed a June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and selected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Under C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2), the appellant has until June 2025 to modify his choice of Board appeal lane, and the "Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up." See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). However, because in this matter a full grant of the issue on appeal is warranted, the Veteran is not prejudiced by the Board issuing this decision without such a delay. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran contends he suffers from tinnitus as a result of his military service. Specifically, he contends that he was routinely exposed to hazardous noise while working as a helicopter mechanic and crew chief. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

A lay person is competent to describe his symptoms of ringing in the ears throughout the years. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002). If a Veteran reports ringing in their ears, a diagnosis of tinnitus is generally applied without further examination. In addition, since the diagnosis of tinnitus is so heavily reliant upon lay statements, the etiology of the disorder is similarly reliant upon them. The date that a veteran reports that the tinnitus symptoms started is generally accepted as the date that the disorder began. Thus, while service connection for tinnitus requires a medical diagnosis of tinnitus and a medical nexus relating the diagnosis to military service, lay testimony plays an unusually important role in these determinations and can even be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis and medical etiology of a condition. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The Board's primary role in adjudicating a tinnitus claim is to assess the credibility of lay statements. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

The June 2024 VA examination show a diagnosis of tinnitus. Additionally, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements about his exposure to hazardous noise are credible and consistent with the record. See May 2024 lay statement.

The Veteran's statements as to the onset and continuity of his tinnitus are credible and sufficient to establish the criteria for service connection for tinnitus. In reaching this conclusion, the Board acknowledges that the June 2024 examiner provided a negative etiological opinion. However, tinnitus symptoms are uniquely reliant upon lay observation. Here, the competing evidence is in approximate balance regarding whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to his noise exposure in service. Thus, the Board resolves the doubt in favor of the Veteran. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 780 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
