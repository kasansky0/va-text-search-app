REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Army from February 1971 to January 1973 and from July 1973 to July 1974.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  This appeal is being adjudicated under the modern appellate framework.  In the May 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD) which commenced this appeal, the Veteran opted into the Direct Review Docket.

As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue(s) on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.  The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Veteran has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

The Board notes that in the May 2024 NOD which commenced this appeal the Veteran also appealed the denial of service connection for a back disability and a left ankle disability; as well as separate pension claim.  In January 2025, the RO granted service connection for a back disability and a left ankle disability.  This is considered a full grant of the Veteran's prayer of relief.  As to the pension claim, the record is silent for a rating decision within one year of the May 2024 NOD related to a pension claim.  As such, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review these claims, and the Board shall not address them any further.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).

1. Service connection for a left shoulder disability is remanded.

2. Service connection for a right shoulder disability is remanded.

At issue is whether the Veteran is entitled to service connection for a bilateral shoulder disability.  In May 2024, the RO previously conceded that the Veteran's reported bilateral shoulder pain constitutes a disability.  The Board is bound by this favorable interpretation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  In March 2024, the Veteran provided competent reports of an in-service incurrence potentially related to the claimed disability.  This is sufficient to trigger VA's duty to assist by providing the Veteran with a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed disability.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  The record is silent for such an examination.  This constitutes a violation of VA's duty to assist, and the Board cannot grant the Veteran's entire prayer of relief at this time.  As such, this matter must be remanded in order to address the above concerns.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Arrange to provide the Veteran with a VA examination in order to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed bilateral shoulder disability.
