ORDER

From March 15, 2016, an initial evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, for plantar fasciitis (claimed as right-foot condition) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

From March 15, 2016, the Veteran's right foot plantar fasciitis manifested as pronounced with extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces, marked deformity, and marked pronation in the right foot that is not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

From March 15, 2016, the criteria for an initial evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, for plantar fasciitis (claimed as right-foot condition) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.14, 4.21, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from July 2014 to March 2016. The Board recognizes the Veteran's service to his country and the sacrifices it entailed. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2022 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) awarding an evaluation of 30 percent for the Veteran's service connected plantar fasciitis effective January 27, 2022.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review in a July 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Increased Rating Claim

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

In cases in which a claim for a higher initial evaluation stems from an initial grant of service connection for the disability at issue, because the severity of impairment may fluctuate over time, multiple ("staged") ratings may be assigned for different periods of time during the pendency of the appeal. See generally Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). Where entitlement to compensation has already been established, and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.

Staged ratings are, however, appropriate for an increased rating claim only when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.

The relevant focus for adjudicating an increased rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim, as the VA recognizes a claimant may not seek an increased rating immediately after an increase in severity becomes noticeable, so it provides claimants with a one-year grace period in which to file an increased rating claim. See generally Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned only if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

From March 15, 2016, an initial evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, for plantar fasciitis (claimed as right-foot condition) is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a higher initial rating for his service-connected plantar fasciitis. Specifically, the Veteran contends that he should be awarded a 30 percent evaluation from March 15, 2016, for his service-connected plantar fasciitis claim, because he has continuously pursued this claim since that time. See April 2023 Appellate Brief; July 2024 VA Form 10182.

Generally, the effective date of an award of benefits is the date of receipt of a claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Under the AMA, however, the date of an initial claim is preserved so long as the Veteran "continuously pursues" the benefit in question by timely and properly filing one of the administrative review options in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

The procedural history of this claim is instructive. The Veteran initially submitted a claim for service connection in December 2016, which was denied in a September 2017 rating decision. The Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement and in an October 2020 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for plantar fasciitis with an evaluation of 10 percent effective March 16, 2016.

 In June 2021, the Veteran submitted a request for a higher-level review. In an August 2021 rating decision, the Veteran's evaluation was increased from 10 to 20 percent effective March 16, 2016. Thereafter, in January 2022, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim. In a May 2022 rating decision, the RO increased the Veteran's award to 30 percent effective January 27, 2022. In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a higher-level review request of that decision and in a July 2023 rating decision, the RO continued the 30 percent evaluation and change the effective date to February 7, 2022, the date of the Veteran's VA examination.

Here, the series of claims challenging the initial rating for this disability qualifies as continuous pursuit. The Board further notes that although the RO initially granted service connection effective March 16, 2016, the Veteran's DD Form 214 reflects that he was discharged from service on March 14, 2016. Thus, because the claim is an initial claim filed within a year from discharge, the Board will consider evidence of symptomatology from March 15, 2016, the day after discharge from active service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

In other words, the date of the claim for purposes of the Veteran's increased rating is March 15, 2016.

This does not, however, translate to a grant of an earlier effective date for the Veteran's 30 percent rating because the effective date is whichever is later between the date entitlement arose and the date the claim was filed. Therefore, the question before the Board concerning this appeal is whether entitlement to a 30 percent rating for plantar fasciitis arose prior to February 7, 2022. 

The Veteran is currently assigned a 20 percent evaluation prior to February 7, 2022, and a 30 percent evaluation thereafter under Diagnostic Code 5276.

The rating criteria for rating musculoskeletal disabilities, including the foot, were amended once during the pendency of the appeal and became effective February 7, 2021. See 86 Fed. Reg. 107 (Sep. 30, 2021). The amendment includes a new diagnostic code for plantar fasciitis. See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76464 (Nov. 30, 2020); amended 86 Fed. Reg. 8142 (Feb. 4, 2021) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5269). In cases where rating criteria are amended during the appeal, the Board must consider both the former and current schedular criteria. 

Generally, if a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g). If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. 38 U.S.C. § 5110.

Effective February 7, 2021, under Diagnostic Code 5269:

A 10 percent rating is assigned for unilateral or bilateral plantar fasciitis.

A 20 percent rating is assigned when there is no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis of one foot (unilateral).

A 30 percent rating is assigned when there is no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis of both feet (bilateral).

A 40 percent rating is assigned under actual loss of use of the foot.

If a veteran has been recommended for surgical intervention, but is not a surgical candidate, plantar fasciitis is to be evaluated under the 20 percent or 30 percent criteria, whichever is applicable.

Under Diagnostic Code 5276, a 20 percent rating for unilateral disability and 30 percent rating for bilateral disability is warranted when there is severe acquired flat foot manifested by objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use, characteristic callosities.

A 30 percent rating is warranted for unilateral disability and 50 percent rating for bilateral disability is warranted when there is pronounced flatfoot manifested by marked pronation, extreme tenderness of the plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo achilles on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276.

The Board notes that the conjunctive form is not specifically employed in the enumeration of rating criteria under Diagnostic Code 5276. Therefore, it is not required that all the manifestations that are listed be shown. See Dyess v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 448 (1991); see also Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 366 (2007) (the cases in which the Court has indicated that 38 C.F.R. § 4.21 applies are those in which the diagnostic criteria are not clearly joined in the conjunctive).

The Board acknowledges that the words "severe" and "pronounced," are not defined in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." See 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. 

"Severe," as an adjective, is defined as "causing discomfort or hardship"; "very painful or harmful"; "of a great degree." Severe, Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/severe, Definitions 6a, 6b, and 8 (last visited April 1, 2025). 

"Pronounced," as an adjective, is defined as "strongly marked." Pronounced, Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pronounced (last visited April 1, 2025).

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that a 30 percent disability rating is warranted from March 15, 2016, under diagnostic code 5276.

As discussed above, the Veteran initially sought service connection for plantar fasciitis in December 2016. A VA examination from 2017 notes that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. However, treatment notes from January 2017 note tenderness on the posterior aspect of the ankle near the midportion of the Achilles' as well as over the inferior lateral portion of the right ankle. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

The Veteran was afforded VA examinations in April 2020, August 2020, and February 2022. During these examinations, the Veteran complained of moderate to severe flare-ups in the right foot that can last up to 24 hours. All three examinations reflect that the Veteran experienced extreme tenderness of the plantar surfaces of the right foot. These exams also demonstrate marked deformity and marked pronation in the right foot that is not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances. See April 2020 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ); August 2020 DBQ; February 2022 DBQ.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that a disability rating of 30 percent is warranted from March 15, 2016. 

In reaching this conclusion, the Board notes that it is not required to have all manifestations listed in the rating criteria in order to receive a specific rating. Here, the record demonstrates that the Veteran experienced marked deformity, marked pronation, and extreme tenderness of the plantar surfaces of the right foot. A higher rating of 50 percent is not warranted, as only the Veteran's right foot is symptomatic.

As noted above, effective February 7, 2021, VA added the new rating criteria for plantar fasciitis, Diagnostic Code 5269. 85 Fed. Reg. 76,453 (Nov. 30, 2020). The Board considered whether a higher rating under Diagnostic Code 5269 is warranted. However, as the Veteran has not had surgical intervention for the right foot, this would not result in a higher disability rating. Only a 10 percent rating is warranted for unilateral plantar fasciitis under diagnostic code 5269 without the need for surgical intervention.

Accordingly, the Board finds that under the more favorable rating criteria of Diagnostic Code 5276, an initial 30 percent rating, but no higher is warranted from March 15, 2016. This appeal is granted.
