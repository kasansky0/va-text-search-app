ORDER

Entitlement to Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran passed away in May 2021; at the time of death, the Veteran was service-connected for chronic fatigue syndrome, prostate cancer residuals, adjustment disorder, residual surgical scars of the neck, malignant neoplasm of the thyroid, bilateral tinnitus, residual painful scars of the neck, hypertension, bilateral hearing loss, erectile dysfunction, and anterior trunk scars for a combined disability rating of 100 percent from August 9, 2016.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1318; 38 C.F.R. § 3.22.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1971 to July 1992.  The Veteran passed away in May 2021.  The appellant is the Veteran's widow.

In April 2023, the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2022 rating decision.  In July 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2022 rating decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 decision.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the appellant and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318

In order to establish entitlement to DIC benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1318, it must be shown that the veteran's death was not the result of his or her own willful misconduct and that at the time of death, the veteran was receiving, or was entitled to receive, compensation for a service-connected disability that was rated by VA as totally disabling for a continuous period of at least 10 years immediately preceding death; or, was rated totally disabling continuously since the veteran's release from active duty and for a period of not less than 5 years immediately preceding death; or, was rated by VA as totally disabling for a continuous period of not less than one year immediately preceding death if the veteran was a former prisoner of war who died after September 30, 1999. 

The total rating may be based on application of the criteria in the rating schedule or on individual unemployability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.22(c); Nat'l Org. of Veterans' Advocates, Inc. v. Sec'y of Veterans of Veterans Affairs, 314 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003). 

The term "entitled to receive" means that the veteran filed a claim for disability compensation during his lifetime and one of the following circumstances is satisfied: (1) the veteran would have received total disability compensation at the time of death for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling for the period specified but for clear and unmistakable error (CUE) committed in a VA decision on a claim filed during the veteran's lifetime; or, (2) additional evidence submitted to VA before or after the veteran's death consisting solely of service department records that existed at the time of a prior VA decision but were not previously considered by VA provides a basis for reopening a claim finally denied during the veteran's lifetime and for awarding a total service-connected disability rating retroactively; or, (3) at the time of death the veteran had a service-connected disability rated totally disabling by VA, but was not receiving compensation because VA was paying the compensation to the veteran's dependents; VA was withholding the compensation under authority of 38 U.S.C. § 5314 to offset an indebtedness of the veteran; the veteran had not waived retired or retirement pay in order to receive compensation; VA was withholding payments under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. § 1174 (h)(2); VA was withholding payments because the veteran's whereabouts were unknown, but the veteran was otherwise entitled continued payments based on a total service-connected disability rating; or, VA was withholding payments under 38 U.S.C. § 5308 but determines that benefits were payable under 38 U.S.C. § 5309. 38 C.F.R. § 3.22(b).

Here, the Board finds that DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 has not been established.  At the time of death, the Veteran was service connected for chronic fatigue syndrome, prostate cancer residuals, adjustment disorder, residual surgical scars of the neck, malignant neoplasm of the thyroid, bilateral tinnitus, residual painful scars of the neck, hypertension, bilateral hearing loss, erectile dysfunction, and anterior trunk scars for a combined disability rating of 100 percent from August 9, 2016.  As the Veteran passed away in May 2021, the Veteran was not receiving, and was not entitled to receive, compensation for a service-connected disability that was rated by VA as totally disabling for a continuous period of at least 10 years immediately preceding death, thus DIC benefits pursuant to § 1318 are not warranted.

The Board is sympathetic to the appellant's arguments, nevertheless, the Board is bound by the laws and regulations that apply to veterans' claims.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.5, 20.101(a).  Although the Board is required to "render a decision which grants every benefit that can be supported in law," there is no basis in law to grant the DIC claim being decided herein.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(a).  For the foregoing reasons, the persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim for DIC benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1318.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application, and the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
