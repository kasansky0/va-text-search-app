ORDER

Entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation, but not higher, for benign growth of the bones (benign mass to frontal bone) prior to April 7, 2020, is granted.

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for benign growth of the bones (benign mass to frontal bone) from April 7, 2020, is denied.   

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Prior to April 7, 2020, the Veteran's growth of the frontal bone has not resulted in any limitation of motion. Also, in absence of limitation of motion, the growth of the frontal bone does not involve two or more major joints or two or more minor joints. However, the Veteran's growth of the frontal bone has had dizzy spells as residual conditions and/or complications.

2. Prior to April 7, 2020, the Veteran's dizzy spells have been manifested by occasional dizziness. 

3. In an April 18, 2024, decision, the Board granted service connection for vertigo as secondary to the Veteran's service connected disabilities.

4. In an April 2024 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) implemented the April 2024 Board decision and indicated that a single evaluation of 10 percent has been assigned for the combined disability of benign mass to frontal bone now to include vertigo effective April 7, 2020.

5. For the period from April 7, 2020, the Veteran's growth of the frontal bone has not resulted in any limitation of motion. Also, the Veteran's disability does not involve two or more major joint groups, or two or more minor joint groups and no occasional incapacitating exacerbations were shown. Moreover, the Veteran's vertigo has not been manifested by dizziness and occasional staggering. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation, but not higher, for benign growth of the bones (benign mass to frontal bone) prior to April 7, 2020, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6204-5015.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for benign growth of the bones (benign mass to frontal bone) from April 7, 2020, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6204-5015.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from February 1999 to May 2006.

In a February 2020 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) awarded service connection for a benign mass to the frontal bone.  An initial noncompensable evaluation was assigned, effective July 11, 2018.  

The Veteran subsequently filed a June 23, 2020, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) electing the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2020 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to a TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

In February 2024, the Board issued a decision in which it denied entitlement to a compensable evaluation for benign growth of the bones (benign mass to frontal bone). The Veteran appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC).

In October 2024, CAVC issued a decision adopting a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) in which it remanded the claim back to the Board. CAVC requested for the Board to: (1) address whether the February 2020 ear conditions VA examination is adequate to satisfy the duty to assist; (2) provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases that addresses whether the Veteran's symptoms of dizzy spells is compensated by his currently assigned ratings; and (3) address whether entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability is warranted.

1. Entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation, but not higher, for benign growth of the bones (benign mass to frontal bone) prior to April 7, 2020, is granted. 

2. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for benign growth of the bones (benign mass to frontal bone) from April 7, 2020, is denied.

The Veteran's benign growth of the bones was originally rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003-5015, for bones, neoplasm, benign. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating assigned. The additional code is shown after a hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Diagnostic Code 5003 rates degenerative arthritis, other than posttraumatic. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Effective February 7, 2021, Diagnostic Code 5015 requires evaluating the disease as degenerative arthritis, based on limitation of motion of affected parts. Prior to February 7, 2021, the Rating Schedule instructed: "The diseases under diagnostic codes 5013 through 5024 will be rated on limitation of motion of affected parts, as arthritis, degenerative, except gout which will be rated under diagnostic code 5002". When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Effective February 7, 2021, 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003, was revised to make clear that this diagnostic code applies only to degenerative arthritis. Specifically, Diagnostic Code 5003 states that degenerative arthritis established by X-ray findings will be rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joints or joints involved (DC 5200 etc.). When, however, the limitation of motion of the specific joint or joints involved is noncompensable under the appropriate diagnostic codes a rating of 10 percent is for application for each such major joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion, to be combined, not added under diagnostic code 5003. Limitation of motion must be objectively confirmed by findings such as swelling, muscle spasm, or satisfactory evidence of painful motion. In the absence of limitation of motion, a 20 percent rating should be used with X-ray evidence of involvement of 2 or more major joints or 2 or more minor joint groups, with occasional incapacitating exacerbations. Also, a 10 percent rating can be granted with X-ray evidence of involvement of 2 or more major joints or 2 or more minor joint groups.

From April 7, 2020, the Veteran's benign mass to frontal bone was rated with Diagnostic Code 6204-5015. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.71a, 4.87. Diagnostic Code 6204 rates peripheral vestibular disorders. Under these criteria, a 10 percent rating is warranted on evidence of peripheral vestibular with occasional dizziness. A 30 percent evaluation will be assigned with dizziness and occasional staggering. The term "occasional" is not defined in the rating criteria. Merriam Webster dictionary defines it as encountered, occurring, appearing, or taken at irregular or infrequent intervals. See, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/occasional (last visited March 27, 2025). A 30 percent disability evaluation is the maximum schedular rating assignable under Diagnostic Code 6204.

In July 2018, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File followed by an August 2018 Fully Developed Claim for brain mass.

In August 2019, the Veteran submitted an April 21, 2018, CT Sinus/Maxillofacial Scan results. The CT scan showed that there no evidence of bony fracture. Also, the CT scan found that there is a well-circumscribed 11 x 7 x 10 mm sclerotic appearing lesion within the central frontal bone just superior to the frontal sinus with thinning of the overlying cortex, which is nonspecific. Moreover, the CT scan demonstrated that there is no associated cortical destruction or extra calvarial mass.

In September 2019, the RO in its rating decision denied service connection for benign mass to frontal bone. 

In September 2019, the Veteran requested a Higher Level Review for his claim of frontal mass on forehead. 

In November 2019, the RO in its rating decision identified a duty to assist error during the Higher Level Review for benign mass to frontal bone and requested an additional examination and medical opinion.

In January 2020, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for Sinusitis, Rhinitis, and Other Conditions of the Nose, Throat, Larynx, and Pharynx. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran has a diagnosis of benign or malignant neoplasm of sinus, nose, throat, larynx, or pharynx. Also, the VA examiner mentioned that a CT scan found one nonspecific 11 x 7 x 10 cm sclerotic appearing lesion within the central frontal bone just superior to the frontal sinus with thinning of the overlying cortex and no appreciable cortical destruction, which is likely non-aggressive. Moreover, the VA examiner indicated that it is medically reasonable to assume that the lesion has been there for a long time given the Veteran's chronic sinus problems with recurrent pansinusitis, nasal bleeding, and congestion. In addition, the VA examiner determined that the neoplasm is benign. Equally, the VA examiner listed the following residual conditions and complications due to the neoplasm: nasal congestion, recurrent headaches, and dizzy spells. Lastly, the VA examiner commented that the condition will impact any type of employment because of symptoms of recurrent headaches, nasal congestion with bleeding, and dizzy spells.

In February 2020, the RO in its rating decision granted service connection for benign mass to frontal bone with a noncompensable evaluation, effective July 11, 2018. The RO indicated that further evaluation of this condition is deferred pending additional examinations. Also, the RO assigned a noncompensable rating based on a lack of objective evidence of painful or limited motion of a major joint or group of minor joints. Moreover, the RO indicated that a VA examiner noted that the symptoms of this condition are nasal congestion, recurrent headaches, and dizzy spells. Thus, all symptoms are evaluated separately from this condition. In this regard, the Veteran has established service connection for allergic rhinitis and episodic cluster headaches.

Accordingly, in February 2020, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for headaches. During the examination, the Veteran indicated that during the last year, he has been experiencing two cluster headaches lasting 2-3 days. The Veteran described his headaches as sharp penetrating and intense pain across the frontal region and behind the eyes with pinpoint pupils, lacrimation, and nasal congestion. Equally, in February 2020, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for ear conditions. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran has a benign neoplasm.

In February 2020, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for ear conditions. The VA examiner noted a diagnosis for vertigo. The VA examiner indicated that the frequency of the vertigo is less than once a month with a duration of less than one hour. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran has a benign neoplasm.

In March 2020, the RO in its rating decision continued an evaluation of 0 percent for benign sclerotic lesion within the central frontal bone, superior to the frontal sinus, with thinning of the overlying cortex. The RO continued the noncompensable rating based on a lack of objective evidence of painful or limited motion of a major joint or group of minor joints.

In June 2020, the Veteran submitted his VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. The Veteran indicated that his frontal bone mass was due to service from microwaves and non-specific to any previous accident.

In September 2020, the Veteran submitted a Statement in Support of Claim in which he indicated that his bone mass is a result of hitting his forehead on a pipe while working on a ship. The Veteran argued that it should be considered a traumatic brain injury and thus, a rating higher than 0 percent shall be granted.

In May 2021, the Veteran's representative submitted an Appellate Brief. First, the representative clarified that the Veteran is appealing the February 6, 2020, rating decision, and not the "2/19" that appears on the VA Form 10182. Also, the representative contended that the Veteran should be granted an increased rating for benign growth of the bones.

In February 2024, the Board issued a decision in which it denied entitlement to a compensable evaluation for benign growth of the bones (benign mass to frontal bone).

In April 2024, the Board issued a decision in which it granted entitlement to service connection for a disability manifested by dizziness or vertigo. The Board concluded that resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, service connection for vertigo/dizziness is warranted as secondary to service-connected disabilities.

In April 2024, the RO in its rating decision adopted the April 2024 Board decision and granted service connection for vertigo effective April 7, 2020. The RO indicated that a single evaluation of 10 percent has been assigned for the combined disability of benign mass to frontal bone now to include vertigo.

In October 2024, CAVC issued a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) to vacate the February 3, 2024, decision of the Board. First, CAVC indicated that the Board should address whether the February 2020 ear conditions VA examination is adequate to satisfy the duty to assist. CAVC highlighted that the Board discussed the February 2020 ear conditions VA examination as part of its analysis in denying a compensable rating for benign bone mass of the frontal bone. However, CAVC remarked that the Board erred by providing an inadequate statement of reasons or bases by not addressing whether the February 2020 VA examination is adequate. CAVC highlighted that the February 2020 VA examiner diagnosed vertigo but did not provide a non-speculative opinion as to whether the vertigo is related to the Veteran's benign bone mass of the frontal bone. Consequently, CAVC stated that remand was warranted for the Board to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases that addresses whether the February 2020 VA ear conditions examination is adequate to satisfy the duty to assist. 

Second, CAVC required that the Board must provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases that addresses whether the Veteran's symptoms of dizzy spells is compensated by his currently assigned ratings. Also, the Board must address whether an increased rating is warranted.

Third, CAVC indicated that remand is warranted to address whether the Veteran is entitled to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU). CAVC highlighted that the January 2020 VA examiner showed that the Veteran's benign bone mass of the frontal bone will impact any type of employments because of symptoms of recurrent headaches, nasal congestion with bleeding and dizzy spells. Moreover, CAVC noted that in October 2021, the Veteran filed a new application for other benefits in which he reported being unemployable due to his disabilities.

Upon review of the evidence of record the Board finds that entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation, but not higher, for benign growth of the bones (benign mass to frontal bone) prior to April 7, 2020, is warranted. Equally, the Board concludes that entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for benign growth of the bones from April 7, 2020, is not warranted. 

The October 2024 CAVC decision required the Board to address whether the February 2020 ear conditions VA examination is adequate to satisfy the duty to assist. It is important to note that in the April 2024 rating decision, the RO implemented the April 2024 Board decision which granted service connection for vertigo as secondary to the Veteran's service connected disabilities. Upon review of the February 2020 ear conditions VA examination, the Board notes that the examination is adequate to satisfy the duty to assist as the examiner provided a precise diagnosis and related symptomatology. The VA examiner acknowledged the Veteran's contentions that his service connected bone mass is the cause of his diagnosed vertigo. The standard of duty to assist was met when the VA examiner referred the Veteran for a further evaluation to address his contentions regarding his vertigo, and consequently seek a non-speculative opinion on this matter. As stated before, the further development of the Veteran's contentions ultimately led to him be service connected for vertigo/dizziness as secondary to the Veteran's service connected disabilities. 

The October 2024 CAVC decision also required the Board to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases that addresses whether the Veteran's symptoms of dizzy spells are compensated by his currently assigned ratings. Equally, the Board must address whether an increased rating is warranted. It is important to highlight that on April 7, 2020, the Veteran submitted a fully developed claim seeking service connection for his vertigo. As mentioned before, the Veteran's dizziness is currently rated along with the Veteran's bone mass effective April 7, 2020. Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms of dizziness described in the January 2020 sinusitis, rhinitis, and other conditions VA examination are now properly compensated as evidenced by the April 2024 rating decision and this decision. 

As discussed above, the RO in the April 2024 rating decision indicated that a single evaluation of 10 percent has been assigned for the combined disability of benign mass to frontal bone now to include vertigo. The Board categorizes this determination as a favorable finding that it is bound upon. Therefore, the Board will adopt the combined rating of Diagnostic Codes 6204 and 5015 to determine if for the period before April 7, 2020, the Veteran is entitled to a higher evaluation. A careful consideration of the medical evidence of record shows that the Veteran had occasional dizziness in relation to his benign mass to frontal bone. Thus, a 10 percent evaluation for the period prior to April 7, 2020, is applicable. However, it is important to mention that a 30 percent evaluation under Diagnostic Code 6204 is not warranted because the Veteran's condition did not exhibit dizziness and occasional staggering. 

The Board reiterates that for the period prior to April 7, 2020, a higher rating under Diagnostic Code 5003 is not warranted because the evidence does not show a limitation of motion. There is no indication that the motion of the Veteran's head is impaired. Also, even in the absence of limitation of motion, a rating of 10 percent under Diagnostic Code 5003, is not warranted because the Veteran's disability does not involve two or more major joint groups or two or more minor joint groups. Equally, a rating of 20 percent under Diagnostic Code 5003, is not warranted because the Veteran's disability does not involve two or more major joint groups, or two or more minor joint groups and no occasional incapacitating exacerbations were shown.

For the period after April 7, 2020, it is important to note that the effective date for the Veteran's service connected vertigo began after the current decision on appeal. Thus, the Board is impeded by law to revise any evidence associated with the case file after the February 2020 rating decision on appeal to determine if the Veteran's benign mass to frontal bone with vertigo warrants a higher evaluation since its assigned effective date. Moreover, the medical evidence associated with the case file during the 90 day post-VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement evidentiary window, does not include specific details regarding the Veteran's contemporaneous symptomatology related to his vertigo. Notwithstanding, as discussed before, the evidence that can be considered by the Board does not show that under Diagnostic Code 6204, an evaluation of 30 percent is warranted because the Veteran's disability did not manifest in dizziness or occasional staggering. In addition, a higher evaluation under Diagnostic Code 5003 or 5015 is not applicable. As highlighted before, a rating of 20 percent under Diagnostic Code 5003, is not warranted because the Veteran's disability does not involve two or more major joint groups, or two or more minor joint groups and no occasional incapacitating exacerbations were shown.

Given the above, the Board finds that the evidence of record supports an evaluation of 10 percent, but not higher, for benign growth of the bones prior to April 7, 2020. On the other hand, the Board concludes that from April 7, 2020, entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for benign growth of the bones (benign mass to frontal bone) is not warranted. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

In October 2024, CAVC requested for the Board to address whether entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability is warranted. CAVC highlighted that the January 2020 VA examiner showed that the Veteran's benign bone mass of the frontal bone will impact any type of employments because of symptoms of recurrent headaches, nasal congestion with bleeding and dizzy spells. Moreover, CAVC noted that in October 2021, the Veteran filed a new application for other benefits in which he reported being unemployable due to his disabilities.

Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board notices that the Veteran has not completed nor submitted a Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, VA Form 21-8940. The failure to obtain information regarding the Veteran's employment constitutes a predecisional duty to assist error.  As the record at the time of the decision on appeal suggested his benign mass may impact employment, remand is necessary to adequately consider whether the Veteran is entitled to a TDIU. VA Form 21-8940 is essential to have a complete employment history and the impact of the Veteran's service connected disabilities on his employment or lack thereof.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Provide the Veteran with a VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability for completion. The letter should inform the Veteran that it is vital to his appeal for entitlement to a TDIU that he provide the information requested on the VA Form 21-8940, to include but not limited to, a detailed explanation of this employers, the nature of the work performed, occupational history, the number of hours worked per week, the dates of employment, and his reasons for leaving his employment. 

Also, provide the Veteran with a VA Form 21-4192, Request for Employment Information in Connection with Claim for Disability Benefits.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
