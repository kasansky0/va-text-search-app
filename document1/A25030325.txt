ORDER

Service connection for otitis media of the right ear with conductive hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for eczema is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's otitis media of the right ear with conductive hearing loss is related to in-service otitis media of the right ear with a perforation of the right tympanic membrane.

2. Throughout the rating period on appeal, the Veteran has been in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for bilateral tinnitus, and the evidence does not suggest that her symptoms of tinnitus are not adequately contemplated by the rating criteria.

3. The Veteran's eczema is manifested by characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body area and none of the exposed area, and no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for otitis media of the right ear with conductive hearing loss are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

2. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260.

3. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for eczema are not met.             38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7806.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Navy from August 2020 to April 2022.

This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that granted service connection and a 10 percent rating for tinnitus and denied service connection for right ear hearing loss. This case also comes to the Board on appeal from a March 2024 AOJ decision that granted a higher 10 percent rating for service-connected eczema.

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a November 2022 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision. Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claims to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

In January 2024 and March 2024, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decisions on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and adjudicated the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of those decisions. See 38?U.S.C. §?5104A; 38?C.F.R. §?3.104(c). 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January and March 2024 AOJ decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board has expanded the scope of the Veteran's claim of service connection for right ear hearing loss as reflected on the title page to include consideration of all disabilities reasonably raised by the record. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009) (holding that the scope of a disability claim includes any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record); Murphy v. Wilkie, 983 F.3d 1313, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (explaining that, to comply with the Clemons lenient-claim-scope rule, "VA must look to all possible diseases or injuries for which the veteran could have reasonably expected to have included in the filing"). Additionally, as emphasized in Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021), VA has a general practice of identifying and adjudicating issues and claims that logically relate to and arise in connection with a claim pending before VA. 

Service Connection 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by the VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385; see also McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15 (2016) (holding that a minimum degree of hearing loss is a prerequisite for entitlement to service connection, and that a change in hearing as a result of service is a disability if it exceeds the levels specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.385).

Service connection for hearing loss may be granted where there is credible evidence of acoustic trauma due to significant noise exposure in service, post-service audiometric findings meeting regulatory requirements for hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes (i.e., under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385), and a medically sound basis upon which to attribute the post-service findings to the injury in service, as opposed to intercurrent causes. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993). To establish entitlement to service connection, it is not required that a hearing loss disability by these standards of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 be demonstrated during service, including at time of separation, although a hearing loss disability by these standards must be currently present, and service connection is possible if this current hearing loss disability can be adequately linked to service. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).

1. Service connection for otitis media of the right ear with conductive hearing loss is granted.

The Veteran asserts that she has right ear hearing loss that is due to an in-service ear infection with a perforated eardrum in 2021. See her August 2022 claim and reported history at the August 2022 and September 2023 VA examinations. Alternatively, she asserts that her right ear hearing loss is due to noise exposure in service, including during weapon exercises, missile launches, and while stationed on a destroyer. 

In light of the Veteran's contentions, a November 2021 service treatment record showing treatment for a perforation of the tympanic membrane of the right ear, and VA examinations in August 2022 and September 2023, the Board has expanded the scope of the claim for service connection for right ear hearing loss to include entitlement to service connection for otitis media of the right ear. 

The AOJ made the following favorable findings: the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability, conductive hearing loss, and a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during her U.S. Navy service. The AOJ noted that the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) was quartermaster, which is consistent with acoustic trauma.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current right ear disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability of otitis media of the right ear with conductive hearing loss that is related to in-service right ear otitis media with a perforation of the right tympanic membrane. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

At a September 2023 VA ear conditions examination, the examiner found no current ear condition, and diagnosed acute otitis media and ruptured tympanic membrane, resolved. However, the requirement that a Veteran have a current disability before service connection may be awarded is satisfied if the Veteran has a disability at the time the claim for disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). 

The August 2022 VA audiological examination shows that a right ear disability was diagnosed during the pendency of the appeal, specifically right ear conductive hearing loss. At that examination, she also had sufficient hearing loss in the right ear to be considered a disability according to the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Sensorineural hearing loss is an enumerated condition under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a); Walker, supra. The evidence reflects that the Veteran has been diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear in the frequency range of 6000 Hertz or higher frequencies. See September 2023 VA audiological examination. At the most recent VA audiological examination in September 2023, she did not have sufficient hearing loss in the right ear to be considered a disability according to the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

At the prior authorized VA audiological evaluation in August 2022, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows: 25, 30, 30, 30, and 30 in the right ear, and 25, 30, 25, 30, and 25 in the left ear, at the respective frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz. Speech discrimination scores using the Maryland CNC word list were 100 percent in the right ear and 100 percent in the left ear. 

On authorized VA audiological evaluation in September 2023, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows: 20, 20, 15, 20, and 25 in the right ear, and 20, 15, 15, 15, and 25 in the left ear, at the respective frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz. Speech discrimination scores using the Maryland CNC word list were 100 percent in the right ear and 100 percent in the left ear. The examiner indicated that the Veteran has normal hearing in the left ear.

During service in early November 2021, the Veteran was seen for complaints of right ear pain (otalgia) for five days. On examination of the right ear, the external auditory canal was normal, the tympanic membrane was erythematous, and there was decreased mobility of tympanic membrane. There was no bulging of the tympanic membrane, and a perforation of the tympanic membrane was visible. There was no fluid in the middle ear. The diagnostic assessment was an unspecified perforation of the tympanic membrane of the right ear. The medical provider prescribed antibiotics.

A hearing loss disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 was not shown during service, including on audiometric testing in mid-November 2021 and March 2022. Audiometric testing on separation examination in mid-November 2021 revealed right ear decibel pure tone thresholds of 10, 20, 5, 5, and 15, and left ear decibel thresholds of 5, 5, 0, 0, and 5, at the respective frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz. Audiometric testing during service in March 2022 revealed right ear decibel pure tone thresholds of 5, 15, 5, 0, and 5, and left ear decibel thresholds of 10, 5, 5, 0, and 10, at the respective frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz. 

At the August 2022 VA audiological examination, the Veteran complained of hearing loss, throbbing, radiating pain, and muffled sound, particularly in the right ear. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's report of in-service ear infections was supported by her medical records dated in November 2021, but a possible threshold shift could not be ascertained because no in-service hearing tests were available for review. The audiologist opined that the Veteran currently presented with a conductive hearing loss, Type B tympanograms, absent acoustic reflexes, and otologic pain consistent with the possibility of an active middle ear pathology, and recommended evaluation of the Veteran by an otologist.

Otitis is defined as inflammation of the ear, and otitis media is defined as inflammation of the middle ear. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1350-1351 (32nd ed. 2012).

Additional service treatment records, including audiograms, were associated with the file in October 2022, and the Veteran underwent VA audiological and ear conditions examinations in September 2023.

The evidence against the claim includes a September 2023 VA audiological opinion. The examiner reviewed the service treatment records, examined the Veteran, and diagnosed sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear in the frequency range of 6000 Hertz or higher frequencies. The examiner opined that there was no permanent positive threshold shift (worse than reference threshold) greater than normal measurement variability at any frequency between 500 and 6000 Hertz for the right ear. The examiner opined that it was not at least as likely as not that the current right ear hearing loss was caused by or a result of an event in service. The rationale was that service audiograms were consistent with hearing within normal limits, and the current audiogram was consistent with hearing loss from 6000 to 8000 Hertz in the right ear, which is not a VA ratable hearing loss.

The evidence in favor of the claim includes a September 2023 VA ear conditions examination and medical opinion. The examiner reviewed and summarized the November 2021 service treatment record and the August 2022 VA examination, and diagnosed acute otitis media and ruptured tympanic membrane, resolved. The examiner opined that the claimed right ear hearing loss is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by the in-service right ear tympanic membrane perforation. The rationale was that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss is secondary to an otitis media that led to a perforated tympanic membrane. On examination, the Veteran's tympanic membrane was fully healed without obvious scar tissue, and this mechanism of injury would not typically cause hearing loss. 

The Board finds that the above September 2023 VA medical opinion provides a positive nexus between the current right ear conductive hearing loss with active middle ear pathology (diagnosed during the pendency of the appeal), and in-service otitis media of the right ear.

Upon review of the record and after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's current conductive right ear hearing loss with active middle ear pathology is related to service. As the evidence is in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is applicable, and the claim for service connection for otitis media of the right ear with conductive hearing loss is granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Increased Ratings 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Disabilities must be reviewed in relation to their history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Other applicable, general policy considerations are: interpreting reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability, 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; resolving any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability in favor of the claimant, 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; where there is a question as to which of two evaluations apply, assigning a higher of the two where the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating, 38 C.F.R. § 4.7; and, evaluating functional impairment on the basis of lack of usefulness, and the effects of the disability upon the person's ordinary activity, 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

The Veteran has appealed for a higher initial rating for service-connected tinnitus, but has not submitted specific arguments in this regard. 

The AOJ has rated the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus as 10 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 6260 throughout the rating period on appeal.  Pursuant to Diagnostic Code 6260, a 10 percent rating is warranted for recurrent tinnitus, whether it is perceived in one ear, both ears, or in the head. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260; Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  As tinnitus is specifically listed in the Rating Schedule, it must be rated under the rating criteria of Diagnostic Code 6260. See Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337 (2015) (when a condition is specifically listed in the rating schedule, it may not be rated by analogy); Scott v. Wilkie, 920 F.3d 1375 (2019).

Tinnitus is defined as a noise in the ears, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1930 (32nd ed. 2012).

As the Veteran has been in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for tinnitus throughout the rating period on appeal, there is no legal basis upon which a higher schedular rating may be assigned.

The August 2022 and September 2023 VA examiners indicated that the Veteran's tinnitus impacted the ordinary conditions of daily life. At the September 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that the ringing caused a muffled sound, loud noises made it worse, and she sometimes had to miss work. The Board finds that the Veteran's reported difficulties due to noise perceived in her ear are specifically contemplated by the rating assigned for bilateral tinnitus under Diagnostic Code 6260. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms and severity level are contemplated by the schedular rating criteria for tinnitus, and referral for consideration of an extraschedular rating is not warranted.

The Board has also considered whether there are other manifestations of service-connected tinnitus that have not yet been adequately compensated. See Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107, 109 (2017) (noting that entitlement to a separate evaluation depends on whether the manifestations of disability for which a separate evaluation is being sought have already been compensated by an assigned evaluation under a different diagnostic code); Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 15-18 (2021).

Governing regulation provides that the evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses is to be avoided. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment).

As discussed above, the Board is granting service connection for otitis media of the right ear with conductive hearing loss. The Veteran's reported symptoms of throbbing, radiating pain, and muffled sound in the right ear, as recorded in the August 2022 VA audiological examination, are contemplated by the now service-connected otitis media of the right ear with conductive hearing loss.

As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected tinnitus, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for eczema is denied.

The Veteran previously asserted that a higher compensable rating was warranted for service-connected eczema because she has patches on her arms, trunk, and legs, which cover more than five percent of her body. See August 2023 HLR informal conference worksheet.  The AOJ subsequently granted a higher 10 percent rating for service-connected eczema under Diagnostic Code 7806 for dermatitis or eczema throughout the rating period on appeal. 

The General Rating Formula for the Skin applies to Diagnostic Codes 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Under this formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected. A 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period. 

A 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period. A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period. Or rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DC's 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating for the Skin for DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824.

Effective August 13, 2018, VA regulations explicitly state that systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).

Here, the evidence of record demonstrates that the predominant disability is eczema and dermatitis. Service treatment records reflect treatment for a skin rash and contact dermatitis, and VA dermatological examinations reflect a diagnosis of eczema. As eczema and dermatitis are specifically listed in the Rating Schedule, it must be rated under the rating criteria of Diagnostic Code 7806. See Copeland, supra.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a rating in excess of 10 percent because the Veteran's eczema/dermatitis does not more nearly approximate characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period. 

Service treatment records reflect treatment for a skin rash and dermatitis. A topical cream, Triamcinolone Acetonide, was prescribed for her rash. In September 2021, the Veteran complained of an itchy rash on the right upper extremity, right lower extremity and neck. On examination, there was a maculopapular rash most prominent on the right forearm volar aspect but also present on the posterior aspect of the neck and the right thigh.

In February 2022, the Veteran was treated for a skin rash on the inside of both elbows; she also reported small lesions on both forearms, back, and shoulder that typically happened when the ship was underway. She said the rash was painful and itchy. On examination, there was erythema, lesions, patches, and scales. The diagnostic assessment was changes in skin texture, and the examiner noted that she was seen for a rash on the flexor surface of her arms.

On VA examination in August 2022, the examiner diagnosed eczema. The Veteran reported that her current symptoms were skin breakouts, rash, and skin irritation, which were treated with over-the-counter Cortizone. The examiner indicated that the Veteran had used medication for her eczema in the past 12 months, specifically hydrocortisone cream, a topical corticosteroid, for a duration of six weeks or more but not constant. On examination, there were visible characteristic lesions of eczema affecting less than 5 percent of the total body area, and none of the exposed area. The examiner also described the appearance and location of the Veteran's eczema as patches of red papular eruption on the arms, trunk, and legs.

The AOJ then requested a clarifying medical opinion to determine the amount of the affected body area, since the August 2022 examiner stated that less than 5 percent of the total body area was affected by eczema, but also stated that eczema was located on the arms, legs, and trunk.

A different VA examiner provided a medical opinion in September 2023. The examiner said she had reviewed the conflicting medical evidence, and stated that the eczema exists on the Veteran's anterior and posterior bilateral legs and bilateral arms, and the front and back of the trunk, and this would account for 90 percent of the body surface area. 

The AOJ then requested another VA skin examination and opinion by an examiner to clarify whether the Veteran has visible characteristic lesions of eczema that cover 90 percent of the Veteran's body, and if not, to indicate the percentage.

At a February 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported that she had progressive symptoms of eczema throughout her body, and she had flare ups a few times per month that could last a few days. The examiner indicated that the Veteran had used medication for her eczema in the past 12 months, specifically a topical steroid, for a duration of less than 6 weeks. On examination, there were visible characteristic lesions of eczema involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body area, and none of the exposed area. The examiner diagnosed eczema, and described the appearance of eczema as redness and dry flaky skin. The examiner described the location of the eczema as the chest, back, front of the knee, and under the breasts. The examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms had worsened, but there was no change to the service-connected diagnosis and no additional diagnoses.

Although the September 2023 examiner opined that the Veteran's eczema exists on multiple areas of the Veteran's body which would account for 90 percent of the body surface area, she did not find that the Veteran had characteristic lesions involving more than 20 percent of the entire body, as required for a higher disability rating in excess of 10 percent.  Moreover, the competent evidence of record does not persuasively show that the Veteran's eczema more nearly approximates characteristic lesions involving more than 20 percent of the entire body or more than 20 percent of exposed areas affected. Finally, the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's eczema is treated with topical medication, and there is no evidence of systemic therapy for eczema. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, to include skin breakouts and an itchy rash, and these reports are credible. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). However, the Veteran does not assert, and the medical records do not otherwise show, that the eczema more nearly approximates the criteria in the next higher rating. 

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's appeal for a rating in excess of 10 percent for eczema. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
