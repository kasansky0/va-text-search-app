REMANDED

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for status post endonasal septoplasty with inferior turbinate reduction to include nasal obstruction with history of nasal fracture is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1996 to July 2000 and from October 2007 to November 2011.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2024. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.301.

1. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for status post endonasal septoplasty with inferior turbinate reduction to include nasal obstruction with history of nasal fracture is remanded.

Remand by the Board in the AMA is proper for correction of duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors). 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.802(a). For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that a remand is proper.

The Board finds the March 2024 VA examination to be inadequate. Under the diagnosis section of the VA examination, the examiner failed to diagnose the Veteran's deviated nasal septum as previous VA examiners diagnosed. Therefore, Part D of the VA examination for deviated nasal septum was not completed by the examiner. The Board finds the VA examiner failed to provide an adequate examination that considers the Veteran's statements, and a remand is warranted for another VA examination. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the current severity of the status post endonasal septoplasty with inferior turbinate reduction to include nasal obstruction with history of nasal fracture. The claims file should be reviewed by the examiner. All necessary tests should be performed, and the results reported. All symptomatology associated with the disability should be reported.
