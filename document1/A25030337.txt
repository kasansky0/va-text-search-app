DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) prior to July 13, 2023 for loss of use of the left eye is dismissed.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 10, 2019 for service connection for traumatic glaucoma of the left eye is dismissed.  

Entitlement to an initial evaluation of 50 percent, but no greater, for left eye traumatic glaucoma is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. SMC for loss of use of the left eye effective September 25, 2007, was granted in a January 2025 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), therefore no case or controversy is before the Board as to this issue.  

2. The Veteran's claim to establish an effective date earlier than March 10, 2019 for left eye traumatic glaucoma was granted in a May 2024 rating decision issued by a VA RO.  The RO assigned an effective date of September 25, 2007.  Therefore no case or controversy is before the Board as to this issue.  

3. The competent and credible evidence shows that the  Veteran's left eye traumatic glaucoma manifested as visual acuity of 5/200 in the left eye and 20/70 for the right eye for the entire period on appeal.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to SMC for loss of use of the left eye have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.1; 20.1001, 20.1002; 20.104; 20.205. 

2. The appeal to establish an earlier effective date for left eye traumatic glaucoma has been abrogated, leaving no question of law or fact in controversy.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

3. The criteria for an initial rating of 50 percent for left eye traumatic glaucoma have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Codes, 6013-6066.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1983 to March 1986.  These matters are before the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) on appeal from the rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in August 2023.

In June 2023, the Board granted the Veteran entitlement to service connection for a left eye disability.  Later that same month, the RO issued a rating decision implementing the Board's decision and granted entitlement to service connection for traumatic glaucoma of the left eye with an initial evaluation of 30 percent effective March 10, 2019.  

In August 2023, the RO issued a rating decision granting the Veteran entitlement to special monthly compensation based on loss of use of eye from July 13, 2023.  The evaluation of 30 percent for traumatic glaucoma of the left eye was continued.  

In the August 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to SMC based on loss of use of left eye vision prior to July 13, 2023.

The August 2023 rating decision on appeal granted SMC based on loss of use of the left eye and assigned an effective date of July 13, 2023.  SMC is payable under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) to a veteran who, as a result of service-connected disability, has blindness of one eye, having only light perception.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a)(4).

The Veteran filed this claim in September 2007.  In his June 2019 Statement in Support of Claim, he stated that the claim started in September 2007.  In August 2023, the Veteran's wife submitted a statement indicating that he filed two claims in September 2007.  

In a January 2025 rating decision, the RO granted the Veteran entitlement to SMC based on loss of use of vision of the left eye effective September 25, 2007.  The RO found that the Veteran continuously pursued the claim since September 25, 2007.  This constitutes a full grant of benefits being sought in this appeal.  Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  As such, there are no additional benefits available to the Veteran and no case and controversy remaining before the Board regarding this appealed issue and it must be dismissed.  

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 10, 2019 for service connection for traumatic glaucoma of the left eye is dismissed.  

In June 2023, the RO implemented the Board's grant of service connection for traumatic glaucoma in the left eye.  Later in June 2023, the RO implemented the decision and assigned an initial evaluation of 30 percent effective March 10, 2019.  That same month, the Veteran filed a motion alleging clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the June 2023 Board decision that granted his claim.  In April 2024, the Board issued a decision dismissing the motion for reversal or revision of the June 2023 Board decision that granted service connection for traumatic glaucoma in the left eye on the basis of CUE.  

In a May 2024 rating decision, the Veteran was granted an effective date of September 25, 2007 for left eye traumatic glaucoma.  There is no indication of a formal or informal claim of service connection prior to September 25, 2007.

This constitutes a full grant of benefits being sought in this appeal.  Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  As such, there are no additional benefits available to the Veteran and no case and controversy remaining before the Board regarding this appealed issue and it is dismissed.  

3. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for traumatic glaucoma of the left eye is denied. 

The Veteran seeks a higher initial disability rating for his service-connected traumatic glaucoma of the left eye, which is currently rated as 30 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 6013-6066.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79.

During the pendency of the appeal, VA issued a final rule revising the portion of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities that addresses the organs of special sense and schedule of ratings for the eyes. 89 Fed. Reg. 15316 (Apr. 10, 2018). The final rule went into effect May 13, 2018. Where there is a change in the rating criteria during the appeal period, the Board will consider the claim in light of both the former and revised schedular rating criteria, although an increased evaluation based on the revised criteria cannot predate the effective date of the amendments.

Under the former criteria, Diagnostic Code 6013 instructed to evaluate open-angle glaucoma based upon visual impairment, with a minimum evaluation of 10 percent if continuous medication is required. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79. Under the revised criteria, Diagnostic Code 6013 instructs to evaluate open-angle glaucoma under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye, with a minimum evaluation of 10 percent if continuous medication is required. Id. The General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye instructs to evaluate based on either visual impairment due to a particular condition or incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation.

The Diagnostic Code also mandates under note (1) that, for the purposes of evaluations under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes. Id.  Note (2) indicates that examples of treatment may include but are not limited to: systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents; intravitreal or periocular injections; laser treatments; or other surgical interventions. Id. The primary difference between the former and revised criteria for Diagnostic Code 6013 is consideration of incapacitating episodes.

Both the former and revised criteria provide for consideration of visual impairment. The amendments made no substantive changes to how visual acuity is rated. Regarding visual field and muscle function examinations, the use of a Goldmann chart is no longer required. There are otherwise no substantive changes to how those types of visual impairment are rated.

DC 6066 provides disability ratings where vision in one eye (the poorer eye) is 10/200 or better. Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 10/200, a 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 50 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100. A 70 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/200. An 80 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 15/200. A 90 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 10/200. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.79.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 15/200, a 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100. A 70 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/200. An 80 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 15/200. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/200, a 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100. A 70 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/200. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/100, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. A 50 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/70, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/50, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/40, a noncompensable disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40 or better. Id.

Under both the former and revised criteria for Diagnostic Code 6066, visual acuity, a 10 percent rating is warranted when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/50, and vision in the other eye is 20/40; when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/70, and vision in other eye is 20/40; or when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/100, and vision in the other eye is 20/40. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79.

A 20 percent rating is warranted when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/70, and vision in the other eye is 20/50; when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/100, and vision in the other eye is 20/50; when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/200, and vision in the other eye is 20/40; or when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 15/200, and vision in the other eye is 20/40. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79.

Evaluation of visual field is based on the remaining field of vision in each eye. The examiner must record the remaining visual field of at least 16 meridians 2212 degrees apart for each eye, even though only the visual field at eight principal meridians 45 degrees apart will be used for rating purposes. Id.

The table of Ratings for Impairment of Visual Fields provides ratings for visual field loss. The first half of the table provides ratings based on loss of an entire half of field of vision in an eye. The second half of the table provides ratings based on the average concentric contraction of the visual field of each eye.

To calculate average concentric contraction, the rater should add the remaining visual field (in degrees) at each of eight principal meridians 45 degrees apart and divide the sum by eight. 38 C.F.R. § 4.77 (b).

To determine the evaluation for visual impairment when both decreased visual acuity and visual field defect are present in one or both eyes and are service connected, separately evaluate the visual acuity and visual field defect (expressed as a level of visual acuity), and combine them under the provisions of § 4.25. 38 C.F.R. § 4.77 (c).

Evaluation of impairment of muscle function is based on the degree of diplopia. The examiner must record test results for the four major quadrants (upward, downward, and right and left lateral) and the central field (20 degrees or less). 38 C.F.R. § 4.78 (a).

Diplopia in the central field (20 degrees or less) of any of the four major quadrants equates to 5/200 visual acuity. From 21 to 30 degrees, diplopia in the down quadrant equates to 15/200 visual acuity, diplopia in either lateral quadrant equates to 20/100 visual acuity, and diplopia in the up quadrant equates to 20/70 visual acuity. From 31 to 40 degrees, diplopia in the down quadrant equates to 20/200 visual acuity, diplopia in either lateral quadrant equates to 20/70 visual acuity, and diplopia in the up quadrant equates to 20/40 visual acuity.

In accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.31, diplopia that is occasional or that is correctable with spectacles is evaluated at 0 percent.

An evaluation for diplopia will be assigned to only one eye. When a claimant has both diplopia and decreased visual acuity or visual field defect, the rater will assign a level of corrected visual acuity for the poorer eye (or the affected eye, if disability of only one eye is service-connected) that is: one step poorer than it would otherwise warrant if the evaluation for diplopia under Diagnostic Code 6090 is 20/70 or 20/100; two steps poorer if the evaluation under Diagnostic Code 6090 is 20/200 or 15/200; or three steps poorer if the evaluation under Diagnostic Code 6090 is 5/200. This adjusted level of corrected visual acuity cannot exceed a level of 5/200. The rater will apply the adjusted visual acuity for the poorer eye and the corrected visual acuity for the better eye to Diagnostic Codes 6065-66 in the table of Impairment of Central Visual Acuity to determine the rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.78 (b)(1).

When diplopia extends beyond more than one quadrant or range of degrees, evaluate diplopia based on the quadrant and degree range that provides the highest evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.78 (b)(2).

When diplopia exists in two separate areas of the same eye, increase the equivalent visual acuity under Diagnostic Code 6090 to the next poorer level of visual acuity, not to exceed 5/200. 38 C.F.R. § 4.78 (b)(3).

Under the former criteria, Diagnostic Code 6013 instructed to evaluate pursuant to visual impairment due to open-angle glaucoma.

Under the revised criteria, Diagnostic Code 6013 instructs to evaluate pursuant to the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye.

The General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye instructs to evaluate a condition based on visual impairment or its rating criteria for incapacitating episodes. Thus, the primary difference between the former and revised criteria is consideration of incapacitating episodes. With regard to visual impairment, the amendments made no substantive changes to how visual acuity is rated.

The General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye instructs to evaluate on the basis of either visual impairment due to a particular condition or on incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation.

Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least one but less than three treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 10 percent rating is warranted. Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least three but less than five treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 20 percent rating is warranted. Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least five but less than seen treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 40 percent rating is warranted. Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring seven or more treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 60 percent rating is warranted.

Note (1) indicates that, for the purposes of evaluations under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes. Note (2) indicates that examples of treatment may include but are not limited to: systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents; intravitreal or periocular injections; laser treatments; or other surgical interventions. Note (3) indicates that, for the purposes of evaluating visual impairment due to a particular condition, refer to 38 C.F.R. § 4.75 - 4.78 and to § 4.79, Diagnostic Codes 6061-6091.

The evaluation of visual impairment is based on impairment of visual acuity (excluding developmental errors of refraction), visual field, and muscle function. 38 C.F.R. § 4.75 (a). Examinations of visual impairment must be conducted by a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist, and the examiner must identify the disease, injury, or other pathologic process for any visual impairment found. Id. § 4.75(b). Examinations of visual field or muscle function will be conducted only when medically indicated. Id. 

In December 2019, the Veteran was seen at a VA medical clinic complaining of decreased vision in the left eye.  The claims file includes a primary medical record indicating that the Veteran has end stage primary open angle glaucoma of the left eye.  A private medical record was submitted in July 2020.  The Veteran's left eye had a 0.9 cup to disc, atrophic optic nerve, and end stage glaucoma with a complete loss of his inferior visual field.

A Disability Benefits Questionnaire was submitted in June 2023 that had been completed in December 2022.  He was diagnosed with glaucoma/trauma.  His visual acuity for the left was 5/200 or worse for uncorrected distance, corrected distance, uncorrected near, and corrected near.  The better eye was 5/200 for uncorrected distance, and 20/20 or better for corrected distance, uncorrected near and corrected near.  The second recorded reading of corrected near and distance were the same.  His pupils were 4 mm, round and reactive to light.  An efferent pupillary defect was present.  It was noted that he had at least 1 but less than 3 incapacitating episodes in the prior 12 months. 

The Veteran did not have anatomical loss, light perception only, extremely poor vision or blindness of the eye.  He also did not have anatomical blindness of the eye or diplopia.  Left eye pressure was 12.  The external eye was normal.  It also reflected early cataract, and 1+ sclerosis.  The optic disc was greater than c/d 0.9 with pallor.  The internal eye examinations were also normal.  

Field testing was performed.  The Veteran had a contraction of the visual field.  The values were:

MERIDIEN	NORMAL DEGREES	LEFT EYE (OS) ACTUAL DEGREES

Up	45	45

Up Temporally	55	55

Temporally	85	0

Down Temporally	85	0

Down	65	0

Down Nasally	50	0

Nasally	60	0

Up Nasally	55	0

There was loss of inferior half of visual field.  There was centrally located scotoma that affected at least 14 of the visual field.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran has legal blindness.  He also has open angle glaucoma and trauma/hemorrhage.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for eye conditions in July 2023.  He was diagnosed with bilateral traumatic glaucoma in 2019, and bilateral nuclear cataract and benign retina neoplasm.  His visual acuity for the left was 5/200 or worse for uncorrected distance, corrected distance, uncorrected near, and corrected near.  His better eye was 20/70 for uncorrected distance, and 20/20 or better for corrected distance, uncorrected near and corrected near.  He did not have a difference equal to two or more lines on the Snellen test type chart or its equivalent between distance and near corrected vision, with the near vision being worse.  Pupil diameter was 3mm, round and reactive to light.  An afferent pupillary defect was not present.  

The Veteran did not have diplopia.  Left eye pressure was 3.  The Veteran's slit lamp was abnormal.  The external lids, lashes, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber and iris.  The external showed +1 nuclear cataract.  The internal eye examination showed 0.95 c/d which is end stage glaucoma of the optic disc.  The vessels, periphery and vitreous were also normal.  He did not have any incapacitating episodes in the prior 12 months.  

Field testing was performed.  The Veteran had a contraction of the visual field.  The values were:

MERIDIEN	NORMAL DEGREES	LEFT EYE (OS) ACTUAL DEGREES

Up	45	25

Up Temporally	55	45

Temporally	85	78

Down Temporally	85	78

Down	65	25

Down Nasally	50	3

Nasally	60	36

Up Nasally	55	38

The Veteran has a loss of visual field defect due to glaucoma.  He does not have scotoma, or legal (statutory) blindness based upon visual field loss.  

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination for eye conditions in April 2024.  He was diagnosed with bilateral traumatic glaucoma in 2019, and bilateral nuclear cataract and benign retina neoplasm in 2023.  His visual acuity for the left was 5/200 or worse for uncorrected distance, corrected distance, uncorrected near, and corrected near.  The vision in the better eye for uncorrected distance was 20/50, and 20/40 for corrected distance, uncorrected near and corrected near.  Pupil diameter was 2mm, round and reactive to light.  An afferent pupillary defect was not present.  He has glaucoma, a lens condition including cataracts and ocular neoplasms.

The Veteran did not have anatomical loss of the eye, vision limited to no more than light perception only, the ability to recognize test letters at 1 foot or closer, or visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with use of a correcting lens based upon visual acuity loss.  He did, however, have the ability to perceive objects, hand movements, or count fingers at 3 feet.  He does not have a corneal irregularity that results in severe irregular astigmatism or diplopia.  

The Veteran's slit lamp examination was abnormal.  The external lids, lashes, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber and iris.  The external showed +1 nuclear cataract.  The internal eye examination showed 0.9 c/d which is severe glaucoma of the optic disc.  The vessels, periphery and vitreous were also normal.  

Field testing was performed.  The Veteran had a contraction of the visual field.  The values were:

MERIDIEN	NORMAL DEGREES	LEFT EYE (OS) ACTUAL DEGREES

Up	45	36

Up Temporally	55	42

Temporally	85	77

Down Temporally	85	64

Down	65	33

Down Nasally	50	0

Nasally	60	30

Up Nasally	55	43

The Veteran has a loss of visual field defect secondary to glaucoma.  He does not have scotoma, or legal (statutory) blindness based upon visual field loss.  He has glaucoma, a lens condition including cataracts and ocular neoplasms.  His decrease in visual acuity or other visual impairment is attributable to glaucoma.  His ens condition is preoperative, and aphakia or dislocation of the crystalline lens was not present.  The Veteran has not had any incapacitating episodes attributable to an eye condition.  His ability to work is impacted as the reduced acuity and visual field loss makes some jobs such as operating heavy machinery difficult or dangerous.

In January 2017 and November 2022, the Veteran submitted articles pertaining to traumatic glaucoma.  The articles do not pertain specifically to the Veteran so the Board affords them low probative value.

Affording the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that a 50 percent disability rating is warranted.  The evidence shows that the Veteran's visual acuity for his left eye has been 5/200 consistently.  His visual acuity of the better eye was 5/200 for uncorrected distance on one occasion, but was typically 2/070 or 20/50.  The Board finds that 20/70 accurately reflects the Veteran's visual acuity for the better eye, and an initial 50 percent disability rating is warranted.  His visual acuity examination results do not meet the criteria for a higher rating under the applicable rating criteria.  Additionally, he has not had incapacitating episodes to warrant a 60 percent rating under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye.
