ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder bicipital tendonitis is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for a right foot disorder, claimed as a stubbed right big toe, separate and distinct from bilateral plantar fasciitis, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his right shoulder bicipital tendonitis began during active service.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a right foot disorder, separate and distinct from bilateral plantar fasciitis, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for right shoulder bicipital tendonitis are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for a right foot disorder are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2011 to November 2014 and June 2020 to June 2023. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued in December 2023 and January 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 and January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Generally, to establish service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of 1) a current disability, 2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and 3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

An award of service connection requires a finding of a current disability that is related to an injury or disease in service. Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309 (1993); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143 (1992). Under applicable regulations, the term "disability" means impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries and their residual conditions. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 296 (1991); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability").

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving the issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When a veteran seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the veteran prevails. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder bicipital tendonitis.

The Veteran contends his right shoulder bicipital tendonitis had its onset in or is otherwise directly related to his military service. Specifically, the Veteran contends, while in service, he fell carrying another soldier and he has been unable to lift his right shoulder over his head since such time.

In the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found the Veteran had a diagnosis of right shoulder bicipital tendonitis and the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service. The Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings under the AMA. There is no clear and unmistakable evidence to rebut this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103(f)(4), 3.104(c). Accordingly, the first and second elements of service connection have been met.

The Veteran was provided VA examinations in January 2023 and January 2024 and a VA opinion in January 2024 to address the nature and etiology of the his claimed right shoulder bicipital tendonitis. Both VA examiners provided a diagnosis of right shoulder bicipital tendonitis, but the January 2024 opinion indicated such was less likely than not incurred in or aggravated by the Veteran's service. In reaching such opinion, the VA examiner did not address the Veteran's lay statements that he injured his shoulder in service while carrying another soldier. Further, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's right shoulder bicipital tendonitis was more likely due to a post service event, illness, or injury. The VA examiner's opinion did not address the January 2023 VA examination which provided a diagnosis of right shoulder bicipital tendonitis. Notably, the January 2023 VA examination occurred while the Veteran was on active duty. 

Based upon the foregoing, the Board affords the January 2024 VA opinion no probative weight as it did not address the Veteran's lay statements, nor did it provide an adequate rationale addressing the relevant evidence of record. Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020) (holding that an "examiner must address the veteran's lay statements to provide the Board with an adequate medical opinion"); see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A]medical opinion... must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions").

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current right shoulder bicipital tendonitis arose during his active service. The Veteran was competent to report symptoms, treatment, injuries, and experiences observable by his senses, including the onset of shoulder pain during active service and continued shoulder pain after separation through the pendency of the appeal. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). There is no reason to doubt the credibility of his lay statements. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see also Coburn v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 427, 432 (2006) (reliance on a veteran's statement renders a medical report incredible only if the Board rejects the statements of the Veteran). In this regard, the Veteran reported injuring his right shoulder while in service and service treatment records show the Veteran was treated for such condition while in service. Further, and notably, the Veteran was initially diagnosed with right shoulder bicipital tendonitis while in service and such diagnosis was confirmed within one year of separation from service. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for his right shoulder bicipital tendonitis is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right foot disorder, claimed as a stubbed right big toe, separate and distinct from bilateral plantar fasciitis.

The Veteran contends he has a right foot disorder that had its onset in or is otherwise directly related to his military service. Specifically, the Veteran contends, while in service, he stubbed his right big toe which has caused issues when he walks.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a right foot disorder, separate and distinct from bilateral plantar fasciitis, and has not had such diagnosis at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

In January 2023, the Veteran was provided a VA examination to determine whether he had a right foot disorder. The VA examiner indicated the Veteran had a diagnosis of plantar fascitis. Such condition has been service connected and is not on appeal herein. While pain was noted, such did not pertain to the Veteran's toes and was attributable to his plantar fasciitis and pain was not present on exam but was caused by overuse. 

Here, the Board affords great probative value to the aforementioned VA examination report as such was completed by trained medical professional who reviewed the record and performed appropriate examinations of the Veteran. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (it is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes to the probative value of a medical opinion); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).

Further, the other post service medical evidence of record is silent for any findings of diagnoses referable to a right foot disorder. In the absence of any clinical evidence supportive of a diagnosis of a disorder and any lay evidence identifying symptoms of a disorder, the evidence of record does not establish that the Veteran has a current disability. In this regard, it is acknowledged that the Veteran's service treatment records in 2012 and 2013 show treatment for a sprained right toe and tinea pedis. Nonetheless, while the Veteran reported issues when he walks, excluding the Veteran's service-connected plantar fasciitis, the record does not reflect any functional impairment related to such pain, nor does the Veteran or the record demonstrate any impact on the Veteran's earning capacity related to such symptoms. Saunders, 886 F.3d 1356. Moreover, the findings reported in the VA examination report are not contradicted by any contemporaneous medical evidence of record. Further, attributing walking issues to the Veteran's stubbed toe and not his service-connected plantar fasciitis requires medical expertise which the Veteran has not been shown to possess. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (holding that interpretation of section 1110 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary). In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Consequently, the Board finds at no time during the pendency of the appeal did the Veteran have a current disability referable to his right foot, separate and distinct from bilateral plantar fasciitis, and the record does not contain a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim. As such, the probative evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, and service connection for such is not warranted. The benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable, and the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, supra.
