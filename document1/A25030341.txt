CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the issue of service connection for cause of death have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(g).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Army from June 1969 to June 1971.

On February 6, 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction issued a rating decision denying service connection for cause of death. On June 10, 2024, and again on June 17, 2024, the appellant submitted simultaneously a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application; a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR); and a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, all seeking review of the February 6, 2024, rating decision.

On June 27, 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sent a Notice of Disagreement Clarification Letter explaining that the appellant can only seek review of issues in one review lane at a time; that the appellant should submit a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days of the date of the letter; and that the Board cannot proceed with a review of the appeal until a new VA Form 10182 is received.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(g), if the claimant fails to provide a timely response, the previous communication from the claimant will not be considered a Notice of Disagreement as to any claim for which clarification was requested. The Board will not consider the claimant to have appealed the decision(s) on any claim(s) as to which clarification was requested and not received. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(g)(2).  Time to respond is set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(g)(1), which provides: The claimant must respond to the Board's request for clarification on or before the later of the following dates: (i) 60 days after the date of the Board's clarification request; or (ii) One year after the date of mailing of notice of the adverse decision being appealed.

Here, no new VA Form 10182 was received within 60 days of the Notice of Disagreement Clarification Letter, nor was any other relevant communication received. The current appeal under docket number 240610-446396 must be dismissed.
