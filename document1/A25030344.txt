REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from October 2001 to April 2007.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 2019 decision.  The HLR request was accompanied by a request to extent the filing deadline due to the COVID 19 pandemic.  This was granted and the HLR request was accepted as timely filed.  In June 2013, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2019 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2019 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.  

In June 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) for "All issues decided in rating decision dated June 30, 2023."  In July 2024, the AOJ sent a letter requesting clarification of the specific issues being appealed and requested a new Notice of Disagreement be filed within 60 days of the letter.  In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a new Notice of Disagreement specifying the issues on appeal as captioned above.  Although this was outside of the one year filing period after the mailing of the June 2023 rating decision, it was within 60 days of the request for clarification and was accepted as timely.  

On his August 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2019 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Regarding each of the claims for earlier effective dates and the claim for increased rating for cervical strain, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims for service connection for left shoulder strain and increased rating for the cervical spine disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Veteran is seeking effective dates before January 30, 2018, for the grant of service connection for his cervical strain, bilateral flat foot with plantar fasciitis, PTSD with MDD and TBI, lumbosacral strain, irritable bowel syndrome, left knee anterior cruciate ligament tear, neck scar, painful scars, right ankle tendonitis, epididymitis, hypertension, left great toe fracture, left knee scar, and right ankle scar.  He is specifically seeking an effective date of May 20, 2009, for each disability.  Because the relevant evidence and law is identical for each of these claims, the Board will address them together in this section.

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date for a grant of service connection is the day after separation from service or date entitlement arose, if a claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. §5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. §3.400(b)(2).

A specific claim in the form prescribed by VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  A "claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998).

Before March 24, 2015, VA's administrative claims process recognized both formal and informal claims. See Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 416 (1999); Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (amending, inter alia, 38 C.F.R. § 3.155, entitled "Informal claims").  Prior to March 24, 2015, any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA was considered an informal claim.  Such informal claim needed to identify the benefit sought.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (in effect prior to March 24, 2015).  The mere presence of medical evidence does not establish an intent on the part of a veteran to seek service connection for that disability; the veteran must have asserted the claim expressly or impliedly.  Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998).  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim had not been filed, an application form would be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it would be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (in effect prior to March 24, 2015).

Beginning March 24, 2015, all claims for VA benefits must be filed on the specific claim form prescribed by the Secretary for that purpose. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.151.

The Veteran separated from active service in April 2007.  The Veteran does not claim, and the record does not show, that he made any communication to VA, formally or informally, requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit administered by VA at any time in the year following his separation.  

On May 20, 2009, the Veteran submitted a VA form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim stating that the Veteran wished to open new claims for twenty one listed conditions including chronic diarrhea, TBI, cervical pain, pain between shoulder blades, lower back pain, bilateral knee conditions, bilateral ankle conditions, bilateral foot conditions, chronic heart burn, PTSD, and tender scars ("neck and others").  He further wrote that "[f]ormal claim 526 is not available please accept informal claim." A few days later he filed a VA form 21-22 Appointment of Veterans Service Organization (VSO) as Claimant's Representative appointing a VSO as his representative.  

A VA form 119 Report of Contact documents a June 17, 2009, phone conversation between the Veteran and a VA employee.  The VA employee first advised the Veteran that his informal claim had been received and clarified his contentions. The VA employee summarized the rest of the call as follows:

Explained to Vet that until we receive a signed VA form 21-526 we cannot proceed with his claim. Advised I would send one to him along with a letter recapping what he is claiming. Veteran stated he has a 21-526 but hasn't put much effort into completing it. Explained that VFW can assist him with that if needed. Restated that we must have a signed 526 in order for his claim to be considered formal, we can't take further action without it. Vet stated he understood.

In a letter to the Veteran dated June 17, 2009, VA stated as follows:

We received notification from you of your intent to file a claim for service connected compensation. We received this notification on May 20, 2009. We are considering this notification to be an informal claim for benefits. Please be advised that we are unable to take any further action until a formal claim has been filed. We are sending you a VA form 21-526.

The letter included the address to send the formal application, the deadline for submitting the formal application, and a phone number, website, and physical address for any questions or request for assistance.  A VA form 21-526 was enclosed with the letter and a copy was sent to his then-representative.

The Veteran did not file a completed VA form 21-526 within one year of his May 20, 2009, informal claim.  VA received no further communication from the Veteran or his representative until January 30, 2018, when he filed a VA form 21-0966 Intent to File and a new VA form 21-22 appointing a new representative.  In December 2018, the Veteran filed a completed VA form 21-526EZ which included claims for service connection for each of the above captioned disabilities.  In a September 2019 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for each of the above captioned disabilities and assigned January 30, 2018, the date of receipt of his intent to file, as the effective date for each grant.  

By assigning the date of claim as the effective date, the AOJ implicitly found that entitlement to service connection for each claimed disability arose either on or before January 30, 2018.  See 38 C.F.R. §3.400(b)(2).  Therefore, the initial question before the Board is whether there is a potential date of claim for any of the claimed disabilities earlier than January 30, 2018.  

The only communication from the Veteran before January 30, 2018, is his May 20, 2009, informal claim and the related June 17, 2009, phone call.  The Veteran concedes that he did not file a completed formal claim within one year of this informal claim.  However, he argues that the June 17, 2009, statement by the VA employee, in combination with the letter of the same date, was misleading, and that he relied on this misleading notice to his detriment, leaving that informal claim pending and unadjudicated.  He specifically argues that the VA employee on the phone told him that they would send 'a letter recapping what he is claiming' along with a copy of the VA form 21-526, but what they actually sent was a form letter that did not contain specifics about his claims.  The Veteran states that as a result of his reliance on the misleading statements he was unable to timely pursue his claims and the May 20, 2009, informal claims therefore remained pending and unadjudicated.  

In support of this argument, the Veteran cites Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 345 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2003) for the proposition that when VA requires additional evidence to substantiate a claim, they must notify the Veteran of this and inform the Veteran of the one year deadline to submit the needed evidence.  He further cites Noah v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 120 (2016) for the proposition that where VA provides misleading notice to the Veteran regarding the statutory time limit to submit evidence and the Veteran can show that they relied on this notice to their detriment, the claim remains pending and unadjudicated.  

The Board is not persuaded by this argument.  After receipt of an informal claim prior to March 24, 2015, the AOJ did not require evidence to support a claim, it required a completed VA form 21-526 in order to initiate the process of assessing what further evidence, if any, would be required to grant whatever claims were eventually formalized on the completed VA form 21-526.  Therefore, the AOJ did not err by failing to inform the Veteran of the evidence necessary to support his claim.  The version of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 in effect at the time of the Veteran's claim required that upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim had not been filed, an application form would be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  

The record shows that this requirement was satisfied by the AOJ enclosing a copy of the VA form 21-526 along with the June 17, 2009, letter.  The Veteran clearly understood that his May 20, 2009, submission was an informal claim, as he wrote this himself at the bottom of the form.  Both verbally and in writing, the AOJ explained to the Veteran that everything on his May 20, 2009, submission was considered an informal claim for service connected compensation, and that no further action could be taken by the AOJ unless and until he submitted a completed VA form 21-526.  The letter correctly stated that the Veteran had one year from the date of his informal claim to submit a completed VA for 21-526 if he wished the May 20, 2009, filing to serve as his date of claim.  

To the extent that the Veteran claims to have been misled by the lack of a more detailed "recap" of what he was claiming, the Board finds that June 17, 2009, letter's referral to an informal claim for service-connected compensation received on May 20, 2009, was sufficient to inform the Veteran of the issues addressed in the letter.  Namely, the AOJ indicated in that letter that the Veteran wished to file a claim for service connection benefits and identified the type of benefits sought.  As the Veteran had filed no other claims up to that point, the Board finds that there was no ambiguity as to which filing or claims were being addressed in the June 17, 2009, letter.  The Board therefore finds that the May 20, 2009, informal claim did not remain pending and unadjudicated beyond one year after its filing.  

As VA received no communication from the Veteran regarding any claimed disability between June 17, 2009, and January 30, 2018, the Board finds that there is no date of claim for any of the Veteran's claimed disabilities earlier than January 30, 2018.  Therefore, the Board finds that earlier effective dates for service connection for cervical strain, bilateral flat foot with plantar fasciitis, PTSD with MDD and TBI, lumbosacral strain, irritable bowel syndrome, left knee anterior cruciate ligament tear, neck scar, painful scars, right ankle tendonitis, epididymitis, hypertension, left great toe fracture, left knee scar, and right ankle scar are not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. §5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. §3.400(b)(2).

As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claims for earlier effective dates for service connection for cervical strain, bilateral flat foot with plantar fasciitis, PTSD with MDD and TBI, lumbosacral strain, irritable bowel syndrome, left knee anterior cruciate ligament tear, neck scar, painful scars, right ankle tendonitis, epididymitis, hypertension, left great toe fracture, left knee scar, and right ankle scar, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 17, 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Increased Rating for Cervical Strain

The issue of entitlement to an increased initial disability rating for cervical strain is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the June 2023 rating decision on appeal.  At a September 2019 VA examination, prior to the June 2023 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran stated to his examiner that he went to a chiropractor for treatment of his cervical strain symptoms as needed.  Despite being put on-notice as to the existence of relevant outstanding treatment records, the AOJ made no attempt to obtain them.  A remand is required to allow VA to obtain these records.

2. Service Connection for Left Shoulder Strain

The issue of entitlement to service connection for left shoulder strain is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the June 2023 rating decision on appeal.  The AOJ obtained an August 2019 medical examination and opinion prior to the June 2023 rating decision on appeal.  However, this medical opinion does not provide an adequate rationale regarding whether the Veteran's left shoulder strain had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.  The AOJ only requested an opinion addressing whether the Veteran's diagnosed condition was related to conceded exposures during the Veteran's service in Southwest Asia.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's left shoulder strain is less likely than not "due to ill defined multisystem disease or toxic exposure in the gulf" but rather is a disease with a clear and specific etiology, which they diagnosed as "overuse injury." Unfortunately, they did not opine as to whether this overuse injury occurred during the Veteran's active service.  A remand is required to obtain this opinion. 

The Veteran has participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) due to service in Iraq and Kuwait between January 2006 and May 2007. See 38 U.S.C. § 1119.  Although VA has an obligation to obtain medical opinions for any service connection claim which cannot be granted where there is evidence of a TERA and of a disability, VA has identified several exceptions to this general obligation where there is no indication of an association between the disability and the TERA. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(b).  Specifically, a TERA opinion is not required for disabilities resulting from physical trauma; mental disorders; disabilities that have not been shown to have any positive association with herbicide exposure; and disabilities that manifested during service or with a clear etiology that is not associated with toxic exposure. See VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).  In this case, the Veteran's left shoulder stain is a disability due to overuse injury, a form of physical trauma.  Thus, an exception to the TERA opinion requirements applies a separate medical opinion compliant with 38 U.S.C. § 1168 is not required. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for the provider of the chiropractic treatment he referred to in his September 2019 VA examination.  Make two requests for the authorized records from any identified and released provider, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

2. Provide the Veteran's claims file to an appropriate medical professional to obtain an opinion regarding his claimed left shoulder strain.  The examiner must review the claims file.  At the examiner's discretion, if a new in-person examination is required in order to provide the requested opinion, schedule the Veteran for an appropriate examination.  

If a diagnosis cannot be provided but the Veteran's condition manifests in symptoms that cause functional impairment, then the examiner should consider them a "disability" for the purpose of providing the requested opinion below.

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

Is the Veteran's left shoulder strain at least as likely as not related to service, including July 2002 weight training incident with diagnosed left shoulder strain, and/or to overuse injury during service?  

In providing the requested opinion, consider the Veteran's description of the in-service injury and symptoms as well as post-service symptoms.  If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that the Veteran's reported injury and symptoms in service and thereafter represented the onset of the current disability, this should be noted.  Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about the symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
