REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 60 percent for service-connected hypertension with secondary chronic kidney disease is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps January 1968 to December 1973.

The rating decision underlying the present appeal was issued in June 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.   Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the June 2023 rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 60 percent for service-connected hypertension with secondary chronic kidney disease is remanded.

The Board finds that a remand is warranted to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error in order to obtain missing private treatment records.

VA Treatment records from January 2023 reflect that the Veteran receives treatment for his disability through an outside provider, with yearly follow ups and labs every 6 months.  A review of the file reflects that only private treatment records up to the year 2020 have been associated with the Veteran's file.  A remand is warranted to obtain private medical treatment records after that date.  

Because the clinical records of the treatment, if obtained, could bear on the outcome of the Veteran's appeal, efforts must be made to procure them.  38 U.S.C. § 5103; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).  See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e)(2) (if VA becomes aware of the existence of relevant records before deciding a claim, VA will, among other things, request that the claimant provide a release for the records).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Ask the Veteran to provide a release for relevant records of treatment from any private practitioners, and to identify, and provide appropriate releases for, any other care providers who may possess new or additional evidence pertinent to the issue on appeal.  If he provides the necessary release(s), assist him in obtaining the records identified, following the procedures set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  Any new or additional (i.e., non-duplicative) evidence received should be associated with the record.  If any of the records sought are not available, the record should be annotated to reflect that fact, and the Veteran and his representative should be notified.
