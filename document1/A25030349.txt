ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating (greater than 0 percent) for service-connected skin condition is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's skin condition did not manifest characteristic legions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable rating (greater than 0 percent) for service-connected skin condition have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.118, DC 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1986 to December 1991.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2021 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the March, 2022, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating (greater than 0 percent) for service-connected skin condition is denied.

The Veteran's skin condition is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7813-7806. Such code calls for dermatitis or dermatophytosis to be rated under the General Rating Formula for the Skin at 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7806. Therein, a non-compensable rating is warranted for skin disorders involving less than 5 percent of the entire body or less than 5 percent of the exposed areas affected, and no more than topical therapy required during the past 12-month period.

A 10 percent rating is warranted for involvement of at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body, or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected, or; intermittent systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs were required for a total duration of less than six weeks during the past 12-month period.

A 30 percent rating is warranted for involvement of 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of the exposed areas affected; when systemic therapy such as with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs were required for a total duration of six weeks or more, but not constantly, during the past 12-month period.

A maximum 60 percent rating is warranted for involvement of more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected, or; when constant or near-constant systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs was required during the past 12-month period.

The term "systemic therapy" does not automatically include topical steroids, and the Board must make a case-specific factual determination. Johnson v. Shulkin, 862 F.3d 1351, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2017).

The Board notes that applicable regulations for rating skin disorders have changed for claims pending on August 13, 2018, and that such regulations should be followed if they are more favorable to the Veteran. See 83 Fed. Reg. 32,592 (July 13, 2018). The new regulations set bright line rules for what constitutes a "topical" versus a "systemic" treatment and define a "systemic" treatment as "therapy administered through any route other than the skin." The Board will apply the old criteria in rating this claim as it is potentially more favorable to the Veteran.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his skin condition in October 2021. The examiner noted several diagnoses for the Veteran, contact dermatitis, dermatophytosis, and dermatosis. The Veteran reported he has a reoccurring rash in his groin area since 1986. The Veteran reports the rash usually occurs when he is in a humid environment that lasts a few weeks. When the rash appears, the Veteran typically uses lotrimin, but reports that medications have stopped working. The examiner noted that the Veteran does not use corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications, no antihistamines, no retinoids, no sympathomimetics, nor biologics. The examiner noted the lotrimin use is topical with less than 6 weeks of use. The examiner noted the Veteran has not had any treatments or procedures other than topical medication in the past 12 months. Regarding the exposure area, the examiner noted the rash covers less than 5 percent of the total body area, and no exposed areas. The examiner noted a reddish rash in the groin during the examination. The Veteran reported missing 1 to 2 weeks of work during the past year due to flare-ups related to his groin rash.

The Veteran submitted lay statements from himself and his wife in support of his claim. In a November 2015 letter, the Veteran reported that he recalled having an outbreak triggered by heat when visiting relatives in East Texas. The Veteran used a combination of lotrimin and hydrocortisone cream to treat his rash. In a November 2015 letter, the Veteran's wife noted the Veteran's recurring rash during the summer months or during humid weather and that he treats his rash with lotrimin and hydrocortisone cream mixture, that he continues to use when he has outbreaks.

The Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim for entitlement to an initial compensable rating for skin condition. There is no medical evidence of record or lay evidence to support a finding that the Veteran's skin condition involves at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body, or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected, or; intermittent systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs were required for a total duration of less than six weeks during the past 12-month period. The Veteran's treatment does not include the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication. The Veteran's condition does not exceed more than six weeks during the past 12 months, nor does the Veteran's condition involves more than 5 percent but less than 20 percent of the entire body or exposed areas.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether entitlement to an initial compensable rating for skin condition is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against a compensable rating. The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), is therefore not for application. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
