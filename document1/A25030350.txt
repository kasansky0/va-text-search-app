FINDING OF FACT

A VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) was received from a billing company that did not furnish the underlying non-VA medical services in question.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

A complete VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) requesting Board review of the issue of entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-VA medical services provided from April 12, 2018 (claim 302121400005652000), has not been received; the appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.204

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In September 2021, the Board received a VA Form 10182 completed by an employee of "Benefit Recovery," who elected the Direct Review docket to review an August 2021 VHA decision. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

In an August 2021 Explanation of Payment, the claim for payment or reimbursement of medical services provided on April 12, 2018 was initially denied because an authorization number was not submitted with the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 17.1004. See January 27, 2023 Medical Expense Reimbursement VHA file, 10. 

A June 2022 Explanation of Payment explained that VA was billed $12,880.60, and paid Baptist Memorial Hospital-Golden Triangle $1,442.75. See id., 8. A January 2023 Report of Contact (memorandum for the file) included that Baptist Memorial Hospital-Golden Triangle was paid for the April 12, 2018 services on June 3, 2022. See id., 2. 

Regardless of subsequent payment to Baptist Memorial Hospital-Golden Triangle, the Board finds that "Benefit Recovery" (Benefit Recovery Specialists) is not a proper claimant that may file a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204 (a Notice of Disagreement may be filed by a claimant or by his or her representative if a proper Power of Attorney is on record or accompanies such Notice of Disagreement).

"Claimant" is generally defined under VA regulations as a person who filed a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 20.3(f), (g). Under Part 17 of the regulations, claimants for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical services for unauthorized treatment may include the veteran who received the services; the hospital, clinic, or community resource which provided the services; or a person other than the veteran who paid for the services. 38 C.F.R. § 17.123.

When viewed in context of authorized non-VA medical services, health care providers include entities authorized to furnish medical services to covered veterans that enter into bid contracts to establish networks of health care providers. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 1703(c), (h); 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4005, 17.4030. There is no indication under the applicable law and regulations that a non-veteran entity that did not furnish the underlying medical services may be considered a claimant.

Benefit Recovery describes itself as an "leader in healthcare operations, revenue cycle management, and software development fields." https://brsi.ai/about/ (accessed April 2, 2025).

The record does not reflect that Benefit Recovery is a health care provider as described in the regulations or that Benefit Recovery provided the underlying treatment on April 12, 2018 (the care was provided by Baptist Memorial Hospital-Golden Triangle), associated with a claim for payment for the non-VA medical services. Moreover, Benefit Recovery is not a "representative" of the Veteran or of the hospital. See 38?C.F.R. §§ 14.627, 14.629 (related to definitions as used in regulations on representation of VA claimants and the requirements for accreditation of service organization representatives, agents, and attorneys).

The Board finds the September 2021 VA Form 10182 filed by Benefit Recovery did not initiate appellate review. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(a), (b)(2)(A) (notices of disagreement shall be in writing, shall identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees, and may be filed by the claimant, the claimant's legal guardian, or such accredited representative, attorney, or authorized agent as may be selected by the claimant or legal guardian.); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202(a), 20.204.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
