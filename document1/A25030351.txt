CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for insomnia disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from July 2006 to August 2013. 

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

In a November 2023 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied entitlement to service connection for sleep disturbances. The Board notes that the claim for sleep disturbances was most recently addressed in an August 2024 rating decision following a November 2023 request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the November 2023 rating decision. As the current appeal was initiated after completion of that HLR review request and within one year of the November 2023 rating decision, the Board may proceed with adjudication of this claim arising from the November 2023 rating decision. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.104; see also Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023) (under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a), a claimant can file more than one administrative review request (i.e., Supplemental Claim, HLR, Notice of Disagreement) in response to an AOJ decision, provided that the requests are filed within one year of the AOJ decision and that the review requests are not pending concurrently.)

The Veteran submitted a timely VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) in August 2024 and, in so doing, requested direct review by the Board. 

Based on the Veteran's choice to pursue a direct review of his appeal, the Board will decide the appeal "based on the evidence of record at the time of the prior decision." Accordingly, no additionally submitted evidence may be considered. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. As such, the Board may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for insomnia disorder

Service connection is granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303. Service connection requires competent evidence of: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) inservice incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Under?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(b), service connection will be presumed where there are either chronic symptoms shown in service or continuity of symptomatology since service for diseases identified as "chronic" in?38?C.F.R. § 3.309(a).?Walker v. Shinseki,?718 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.

To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must persuasively stand against a finding that the evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

The Veteran contends that he has insomnia disorder, claimed as sleep disturbances, related to his service. He reports that his sleep disturbances are due to the stress of training and stressful situations experienced in service. February 2023 Fully Developed Claim. 

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) include a March 2010 diagnosis of primary insomnia without sleep apnea. The Veteran has been diagnosed with insomnia disorder, as reflected in the October 2023 VA examination. 

The Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current insomnia disorder had its onset during or is etiologically related to active service. The Veteran's entrance examination was normal and insomnia or no sleep difficulties were noted at the time of his entry into service. The Veteran's STRs note that he was diagnosed with primary insomnia during service, and he has a current diagnosis of insomnia disorder. While the October 2023 VA examiner provided a negative opinion, the examiner failed to consider the documented diagnosis of primary insomnia recorded in his STRs and incorrectly determined that the Veteran's STRs indicate no insomnia symptoms. Accordingly, resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran's insomnia disorder had its onset and was diagnosed during his service. Service connection for insomnia disorder is therefore granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
