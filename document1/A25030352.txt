FINDING OF FACT

Benign prostatic hyperplasia did not have its onset in service and is not otherwise related to service. The evidence does not support that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during service on either a direct or a presumptive basis. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for benign prostatic hyperplasia have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1959 to July 1980.

In the May 2024 rating decision currently on appeal, entitlement to service connection for benign prostatic hyperplasia, left hand malignant melanoma, malignant melanoma of the face, a heart disability, an aortic aneurysm, and peripheral vascular disease of the bilateral lower extremity was denied. The Veteran submitted a May 2024 VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review, and a June 2024 higher level review rating decision was issued, wherein the agency of original jurisdiction continued the denials of service connection for each of the claims.

The Veteran appealed the decision to the Board by submitting a June 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, and electing the Hearing docket. The hearing before the Board was held on October 7, 2024. 

In a Hearing appeal under the Appeals Modernization Act, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran and/or the representative on or within 90 days from the date of the Veteran's hearing, which would have been on January 6, 2025. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302. The Board cannot consider (1) evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and before the date of the Veteran's Board hearing or (2) evidence submitted more than 90 days after the Veteran's Board hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302. Following the hearing, additional evidence has been submitted.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Because the Board is remanding several of the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Disorders diagnosed after discharge will still be service connected if all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for certain diseases associated with exposure to herbicide agents. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6).

If a veteran was exposed to a herbicide agent (to include Agent Orange) during active military, naval or air service and has contracted an enumerated disease to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after service (except for chloracne and early-onset peripheral neuropathy, which must be manifested within a year of the last exposure to an herbicide agent during service), the veteran is entitled to a presumption of service connection even though there is no record of such disease during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1112; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307, 3.309(e).

Presumptive exposure was limited to service within the territorial landmass of Vietnam, or the waters offshore. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii). The question of further application of the presumption to Blue Water Service became the subject of litigation, and pending the outcome a stay was placed on these cases. Thereafter, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) decided the case of Procopio v. Wilkie, 913 F.3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2019) which updated the presumption to include Blue Water Service. Procopio held that the legal presumption of exposure to herbicide agents was now extended to those veterans who had service within the territorial waters of Vietnam, provided within a 12-mile nautical mile radius from the landmass of Vietnam.

If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active service, presumptive service connection is warranted for several medical conditions. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). In order to establish presumptive service connection for a disease associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service, a veteran must show the following: (1) that he served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975; (2) that he currently suffers from a disease associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents enumerated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e); and (3) that the current disease process manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within the specified time period prescribed in section 3.307(a)(6)(ii). 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e) Service in the Republic of Vietnam under this provision includes service on the landmass and service on inland waterways. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(f).

Congress enacted legislation entitled the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019, which became effective January 1, 2020. 116 P.L. 23, 133 Stat. 966 (2019). Pursuant to this legislation, for the purposes of determining whether a veteran may be presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents, the term "service in the Republic of Vietnam" was expanded to include service in the offshore waters, which includes the territorial sea extending 12 nautical miles from the shores of that nation. 38 U.S.C. § 1116A. The statute further delineates latitudinal and longitudinal intersecting points within the territorial waters of Vietnam and Cambodia. Notably, as the Federal Circuit has pointed out, the Republic of Vietnam specifically refers to what was, during the war, South Vietnam. Procopio, 913 F.3d at 1375-76. 

These diseases subject to presumptive service connection for herbicide agent exposure are enumerated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e), but do not include benign prostatic hyperplasia. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Veteran may establish service connection with proof of direct causation. 38 U.S.C. § 1113(b); Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

1. Entitlement to service connection for benign prostatic hyperplasia

The Board has carefully reviewed the evidence of record and finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the award of service connection for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The reasons follow.

The Veteran has been diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and thus there is evidence of a current disability. For example, in an April 2024 VA examination report, the examiner diagnosed benign prostatic hyperplasia. In the June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ found that there is evidence of a current disability of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Thus, the facts establish that the first element of a service-connection claim is met.

As to an in-service disease or injury, the evidence supports a finding of a disease or injury in service based on a March 2024 VA Memorandum, wherein the AOJ found that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) and was exposed to asbestos because of his work as an electronics technician during service. 

In a March 2021, VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, the Veteran contended that he was exposed to Agent Orange during service, which caused his benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, after an exhaustive review of the details of the Veteran's service, the Board finds that evidence does not support a finding of herbicide agent exposure during service, including as a Blue Water Navy veteran despite service aboard several ships. 

In several September 2021 Records Research Responses, the Records Research Center (RRC) considered the Veteran's report of assignment to the USS Constellation (CVA-64). The response showed that herbicide agent exposure could not be conceded. The RRC stated that a professional researcher from the Veterans Benefits Administration, Office of Field Operations, Military Records Research Center, completed comprehensive research on the circumstances of the Veteran's claimed exposure, which was while aboard the USS Constellation CVA-64 from August 4, 1969 to October 3, 1969. The following sources were reviewed in an attempt to substantiate the Veteran's claimed exposure. The RRC requested records from Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC), the custodian of Naval Command History records for 1969. NHHC was unable to locate records for the ship and dates the Veteran provided. Also 1961-2003 Ship History submitted by the Dictionary of the American Naval Fighting Ships was reviewed. 

The RRC also considered the Veteran's service aboard the USS Springfield (CLG 7) from January 13, 1969 to February 23, 1969. The RRC reviewed the 1969 USS Springfield (CLG-7) command history, and deck logs for the USS Springfield for the period of the Veteran's service aboard the ship. The history and deck logs do not document that the Veteran served on the ground in Vietnam, or that the ship anchored or docked in a bay or harbor, traveled along rivers in Vietnam, or traversed the territorial offshore waters of Vietnam. The report also found that the evidence did not substantiate the Veteran's claim of exposure to herbicide agent or that he is a Blue Water Navy veteran. 

Next the RRC considered the Veteran's service aboard the USS Holland (AS-32) during the period January 16, 1975 to May 7, 1975. The RRC reviewed the 1974, and 1975 USS Holland command histories, which document that on November 8, 1974, the USS Bremerton entered Drydock #3, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, for conversion from POLARIS to POSEIDEN tender capabilities, which was completed on June 20, 1975. The RRC stated that the histories and service personnel records do not document the Veteran served on the ground in Vietnam, or that the ship anchored or docked in a bay or harbor, traveled along rivers in Vietnam, or traversed the territorial offshore waters of Vietnam.

The Veteran was also assigned to the USS Bryce Canyon (AD-36) during the period from September 8, 1966 to October 4, 1966, and from October 25, 1966 to July 1, 1967. The RRC reviewed the 1966 and 1967 USS Bryce Canyon (AD-36) command histories and deck logs for the USS Bryce Canyon (AD-36) for the period from September 8, 1966 to October 4, 1966, and from October 25, 1966 to July 1, 1967. The histories and deck logs do not document the Veteran served on the ground in Vietnam, or that the ship anchored or docked in a bay or harbor, traveled along rivers in Vietnam, or traversed the territorial offshore waters of Vietnam.

In November 2021, a Records Research Response reviewed the Veteran's service aboard the USS Bushnell (AS-15) from March 17, 1965 to July 14, 1962; January 20, 1963 to July 1, 1963, and September 4, 1963 to January 5, 1964, when the Veteran contends was exposed to herbicides. The RRC wrote that the following sources were reviewed in an attempt to substantiate the Veteran's claimed exposure: the 1963 Command History Report and the April 10, 1962, June 5, 1962, and October 27, 1963 Deck Logs submitted by the USS Bushnell AS-15 and the RRC also requested records from NHHC. However, NHHC was unable to locate records for the ship and dates the Veteran provided. However, the RRC wrote it had reviewed the 1942-1983 Ship History submitted by the Dictionary of the American Naval Fighting Ships.

In December 2021, a Records Research Response reviewed the Veteran's service aboard the USS Penguin (AS-12) from July 14, 1962 to January 20, 1963. The RRC wrote the following sources were reviewed in an attempt to substantiate the Veteran's claimed exposure: the 1962 and 1963 Command History Reports and October 29, 1962 and January 14, 1963 Deck Logs submitted by the USS Penguin. 

In January 2021, a Records Research Response reviewed the Veteran's service aboard the USS Sandoval (LPA-194) from March 4, 1969 to April 18, 1969. The 1944-1974 ships history was reviewed in an attempt to substantiate the Veteran's claimed exposure event. The RRC also requested records from the NHHC, but was unable to locate command history for the USS Sandoval for year 1964.

A June 2022 RRT Review of the Veteran considered the Veteran's service aboard the USS Bushnell, USS Penguin, USS B. Canyon, USS Springfield, USS Sea Devil, USS Constellation, and USS Holland. The pertinent deck logs of those ships assigned to service in the West Pacific while the Veteran was aboard were manually reviewed. The review concluded that Agent Orange exposure could not be conceded. 

In a March 2023 statement, the Veteran contended that during his service aboard the USS Constellation, due to the location of his sleeping quarters, he would take a long distance to get around the ship, and that he was exposed to dust and water that was contaminated with Agent Orange. 

In September 2023, a Records Research Response reviewed the Veteran's service aboard the USS Sea Devil (SSN-654) from June 2, 1969 to July 1, 1969. The RRC reported that it partnered with the classified records archivists at the NHHC, and areas of exposure associated with the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022, were also reviewed. The RRC reported that their classified researcher was unable to confirm the exposure claimed by the Veteran. An October 2023 RRT concluded that herbicide agent exposure could not be conceded for the Veteran's service aboard the USS Holland from January 16, 1975 to October 10, 1977. 

Based on the foregoing research efforts, the Board finds that the evidence does not support a finding that the Veteran had exposure to herbicide agents during service while aboard these ships. Although the Veteran has contended that he believes he was exposed to water or dust that was contaminated by herbicide agents during service, the Board finds that he is not competent to assert such exposure, as verification would require expert chemical analysis of the alleged contaminants. 

At the October 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran contended that the fact that he is in receipt of the Vietnam Campaign Medal establishes that he served within 12 nautical miles of Vietnam. The Veteran's DD Form 214 shows that he was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal. The Board notes that neither medal was awarded exclusively to those who served in the Republic of Vietnam or within 12 nautical miles of Vietnam, and were, instead, awarded to all individuals who served during the Vietnam era performing duties that supported the war. Thus, the Veteran's contention is not afforded probative value. The Veteran's contentions are otherwise outweighed by the RRC responses, which are afforded probative value because they rely on objective military personnel records which were created contemporaneously with service. 

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of exposure to herbicide agents during service, including status as a "Blue Water" Navy veteran.

While VA concedes that the Veteran had asbestos exposure during service, the evidence does not support a finding of a disease or injury in service related to benign prostatic hyperplasia. The service treatment records (STRs) show that the Veteran was found to have clinically normal evaluations of his endocrine and genitourinary systems in Reports of Medical Examination from February 1961, October 1962, December 1966, September 1972, June 1974, and July 1980 at separation from service. In Reports of Medical History from October 1962 and July 1980 at separation, the Veteran denied a history of frequent or painful urination and blood in urine, which shows that he was not experiencing genitourinary symptoms in service. Accordingly, for these reasons, the Board finds the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of disease or injury related to benign prostatic hyperplasia during service, although the in-service disease or injury element is satisfied due to his TERA exposure. 

However, the evidence persuasively weighs against a nexus between benign prostatic hyperplasia and service. For example, in a January 2001 private treatment record, it was noted that the Veteran was first diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia in 2001, which is more than 20 years after service, and does not lend to a finding that benign prostatic hyperplasia had its onset in service.

The Veteran's medical history shows numerous instances of benign prostatic hyperplasia with and without obstruction, in 2001, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2018. As the Veteran's private physicians have documented almost two decades of medical history involving the Veteran's symptoms and diagnoses, the Board finds that if the Veteran had an earlier onset of related symptoms, such would have been noted in this record. This private treatment records have clearly documented a thorough medical history of the Veteran's disability, and the fact that an earlier history was not documented is indicative that he did not have an earlier related medical history. 

However, at the April 2024 VA examination report, the Veteran reported that he began experiencing difficulty urinated with intermittent constipation and a diagnosis of an enlarged prostate in 1983. The Veteran reiterated timeframe for the onset of his genitourinary symptoms at the October 2024 Board hearing. Records from this time period are not available, and thus the Board cannot evaluate the veracity of this claim. However, even if the Board were to accept the Veteran's reported medical history, his reported onset was approximately three years after separation from service and establishes that the Veteran's benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms were not continuous since service.

The April 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's benign prostatic hyperplasia was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The Board notes that the April 2024 VA examination report identified the Veteran's Benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms as a type of prostate gland injury. The examiner explained that the Veteran's enlarged prostate was not caused by the indicated TERA of asbestos exposure, because there is no medical or scientific evidence available that identifies a causal relationship between asbestos exposure and the development of prostate enlargement. 

The examiner reviewed the evidence and provided an opinion with a rationale that was based on the specific facts of the case and medical principles. In light of the VA examiner's consideration of medical and scientific evidence, the Board affords this opinion probative value and finds that it is evidence against a finding that benign prostatic hyperplasia is related to the Veteran's TERA. The facts upon which the examiner based the opinion are the same facts that the Board finds are the most accurate facts, which is that the Veteran was exposed to asbestos during service. Thus, the examiner's opinion is based on an accurate set of facts.

At the present time, there is no competent and probative evidence of a nexus between the benign prostatic hyperplasia and service to weigh against the April 2024 VA medical opinion, and the nexus element of a service-connection claim is not met.

VA did not provide the Veteran with a VA examination or opinion in connection with the direct theory of entitlement. VA must provide a medical examination and/or medical opinion when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) there is insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). 

Here, for the reasons described above, the Board finds both that there was not an event, injury, or disease that occurred in service related to benign prostatic hyperplasia. The evidence also does not establish benign prostatic hyperplasia may be directly associated with the Veteran's service. For a VA examination and/or medical opinion to be warranted, all the McLendon criteria have to be met, and at least one of the criteria is not met. Therefore, entitlement to a VA examination and/or medical opinion is not warranted for this claim.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether entitlement to service connection for benign prostatic hyperplasia is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against service connection. The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to service connection for left hand malignant melanoma is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for malignant melanoma of the face is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his malignant melanoma is related to herbicide agent exposure during service. However, as discussed above the Board has found that the Veteran was not exposed to herbicide agents during service. However, even if the Veteran were found to have been exposed to herbicide agents during service, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has determined that a positive association does not exist between herbicide exposure and cancers of the skin, including melanoma, and thus presumptive service connection would still not be warranted. 

However, as the Veteran had service in the Navy for more than 20 years and likely had significant sun exposure, the Board finds that this issue must be remanded to afford him a VA opinion. The Board finds that it was a pre-decisional duty to assist error for the AOJ to not consider such exposure before the issuance of the May 2024 rating decision currently on appeal.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a heart disability, to include ischemic heart disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure and coronary artery bypass graft is remanded.

5. Entitlement to service connection for an aortic aneurysm is remanded.

6. Entitlement to service connection for peripheral vascular disease of the left lower extremity is remanded.

7. Entitlement to service connection for peripheral vascular disease of the right lower extremity is remanded.

In a July 1980 Report of Medical History, the Veteran reported a positive history of palpitation or pounding heart and pain or pressure in chest and documented he was unsure if he had a history of heart trouble. When asked about his present health, he wrote he had not felt good for the last two months. 

A January 2001 private treatment record shows that the Veteran underwent Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). An April 2024 VA examination report shows that the Veteran was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm and peripheral vascular disease. Another April 2024 VA examination shows that the Veteran was diagnosed with coronary heart disease and ischemic heart disease. 

VA must provide a medical examination and/or medical opinion when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) there is insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

Here, as the Veteran reported a history of heart related symptoms during service, and has a current disability for both a heart disability and an aortic aneurysm, the Board finds that the McLendon criteria were satisfied prior to the time of the May 2024 rating decision currently on appeal, and a pre-decisional duty to assist error occurred when the AOJ did not provide the Veteran with a VA medical opinion that considered the direct theory of entitlement. 

Notably, the April 2024 VA examination report shows that the Veteran's aortic aneurysm and peripheral vascular disease are related, and thus these issues are inextricably intertwined and also warranted a VA opinion prior to the time of the May 2024 rating decision on appeal.

As examinations have already been obtained for these disabilities, the Board finds that remanding these issues for VA medical opinions is sufficient. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule a VA examination and obtain medical opinions from an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of left hand malignant melanoma and malignant melanoma of the face. The examiner should have access to the Veteran's claims file.

The examiner is asked to consider the Veteran's likely sun exposure during service. Please explain upon what facts, medical principles, and/or medical literature the opinion is based.

If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resorting to mere speculation, he or she should explain why this is so. The examiner shall then explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for more information and indicate what additional evidence is necessary, or whether he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to the question.

2. Obtain opinions from an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of a heart disability and of an aortic aneurysm. Schedule an examination if deemed necessary. The examiner should have access to the Veteran's claims file. 

The agency of original jurisdiction must provide a copy of the below facts to the examiner.
