ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's?bilateral?hearing?loss?is related to in-service noise exposure.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107;?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1971 to September 1977.

This matter is on appeal to the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) from an April 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is also the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

On the June 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected Direct Review. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 rating decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. §?20.301. Any evidence submitted after the rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that a February 2025 letter sought clarification from the Veteran regarding his representation and provided him an opportunity to appoint a new representative, if necessary. The Veteran did not respond to the Board's correspondence. Thus, the Veteran is recognized as proceeding pro se (unrepresented) in this appeal.

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for bilateral hearing loss incurred during service. Specifically, the Veteran asserts that he served in the Air Force on the flight line, debriefing pilots with their jet engines running, which caused hearing loss that has continued to the present, making it difficult to hear people speaking to him. See June 2023 Notice of Disagreement and April 2023 VA examination.

Generally, service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from an injury or disease caused or aggravated by service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303. A grant of service connection for a disability requires: (1) a present disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship ("nexus") between the present disability and the in-service event, injury, or disease. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Hearing loss?is considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 hertz is 40 decibels or greater, or when the auditory threshold for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 hertz are 26 decibels or greater, or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.?38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The threshold for normal?hearing?is from 0 to 20 decibels, with higher threshold levels indicating some degree of?hearing?loss. Hensley v. Brown,?5?Vet. App.?155, 156?(1993). 

Certain chronic diseases, including?hearing?loss as an organic disease of the nervous system, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with?continuity?of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.?38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137;?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki,?708 F.3d 1331, 1338?(Fed. Cir. 2013). 

VA must consider all the evidence of record and its relative weight. If the evidence is in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.?38 U.S.C. § 5107?(b);?38 C.F.R. § 3.102. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

In this case, the AOJ has made a favorable finding that the Veteran's hearing loss as reflected in audiometric tests constitutes a disability for VA purposes. The AOJ also favorably found that the Veteran was exposed to excessive noise during service, and his hearing loss disability is presumptively connected to service. See April 2023 rating decision. As such, the first two elements of service connection have been met. 

At issue is whether the evidence of record establishes a nexus between military noise exposure and the current disability. The Board?finds?that it does, as discussed below. 

Regarding the in-service onset of the Veteran's hearing loss, the Board finds the Veteran competent and credible in his account of the onset of his symptoms during service and persistence of his symptoms post-service. The Veteran reported that during service he was exposed to damaging jet engine noise and the symptoms have continued since then to the present. See June 2023 Notice of Disagreement and April 2023 VA examination. Audiometric tests show threshold shifts, including significant shifts in the left ear, from the Veteran's service continuing to the present.  See April 2023 VA examination; see also March 2023 Military Personnel Records. 

The Board has considered the negative opinion of the April 2023 VA examination. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's more profound left ear hearing loss has a direct nexus to his service, but that hearing in both ears is less likely than not caused by military noise exposure. The examiner reasoned that the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of radio broadcasting has a low probability of hazardous noise exposure and that a causal connection is not supported by in-service audiometric test results. See April 2023 VA examination. 

The Board finds the nexus opinion to be of little probative value. As noted, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran was exposed to excessive noise during service. An MOS definition does not reflect the actual conditions of the Veteran's military noise exposure. Further, audiometric tests showing normal hearing cannot alone sustain a denial of service connection where other evidence in the record is to the contrary. See Hensley at 160. Here, the record includes the Veteran's lay statements about his in-service noise exposure and audiometric tests show threshold shifts in the Veteran's hearing. See April 2023 VA examination. The examiner did not consider this other evidence of record. 

Here, the Veteran has provided competent and credible statements regarding the in-service onset of his hearing loss symptoms, and the persistence of symptoms since his discharge. Thus, the Board finds these statements sufficient to warrant service connection for hearing loss based on?continuity?of symptomatology. 

(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)?

Accordingly, the Board finds the evidence to be in approximate balance, therefore, after resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.?38 U.S.C. § 5107;?38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch at 781-82.
