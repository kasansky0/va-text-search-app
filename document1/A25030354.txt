ORDER

An effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypertension is denied.

A compensable disability rating for hypertension is denied.

The appeal for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus is dismissed.

The appeal for an effective date earlier than August 3, 2021, for the award of service connection for diabetes mellitus is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On August 3, 2021, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for hypertension.  Entitlement to service connection for hypertension arose on August 10, 2022, subsequent to the filing of the August 3, 2021, claim.

2. The Veteran's hypertension is not manifested by diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more with continuous medication required for control.

3. On December 12, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran and his representative that a withdrawal of the appeals for a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus, and an effective date earlier than August 3, 2021, for the award of service connection for that disability, is requested.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5103, 5103A, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1, 3.102, 3.155, 3.159, 3.310, 3.400, 3.816.

2. The criteria for a compensable disability rating for hypertension are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

3. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeals for a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus, and an effective date earlier than August 3, 2021, for the award of service connection for that disability, by Veteran and his representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1968 to March 1970 in the United States Army.  

The September and October 2023 rating decisions on appeal constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In September 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on December 12, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September and October 2023 rating decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. An effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypertension is denied.

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection based upon an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase is either the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise it will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b). 

A claim is a formal or informal communication, in writing, requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p).  VA amended its regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  

Any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, from a claimant, his duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not sui juris, may be considered an informal claim.  Such an informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If received within one year after the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155; Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413 (1999). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  Evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypertension.  The exact date sought is unknown from his pleadings and correspondence.

The Veteran separated from service in March 1970.  A claim for service connection for hypertension was not received within one year of the date of discharge.  

On August 3, 2021, VA received an Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (VA Form 21-526EZ), in which the Veteran requested service connection for hypertension.  In a March 2022 rating decision, the VA Regional Office denied the claim.  In response, the Veteran filed a March 2022 VA Form 10182, appealing the matter to the Board.

In an August 2023 decision, the Board granted service connection hypertension pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act).

In turn, in a September 2023 rating decision, the VA Regional Office awarded service connection for hypertension, effective August 10, 2022.  

In September 2024, within one year of the rating decision, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, in which he disagreed with the effective date of August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection.

As noted, service connection for hypertension was granted pursuant to the PACT Act.  The PACT Act added hypertension to the list of diseases that are presumed due to in-service herbicide agent exposure.  38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2).  Prior to the PACT Act, hypertension was not included on the list.  For service connection claims granted pursuant to the PACT Act and filed prior to or within one year of the Act, the earliest effective date assignable is August 10, 2022.  38 C.F.R. § 3.114.   

Additionally, 38 C.F.R. § 3.816 sets forth the effective date rules required by orders of the United States District Court in the class-action case of Nehmer v. U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, pertinent to Vietnam veterans with covered herbicide-related diseases.  See Nehmer v. U.S. Veterans Admin., 32 F. Supp. 1404 (N.D. Cal. 1989) (Nehmer I); Nehmer v. U.S. Veterans Admin., 32 F. Supp. 2d 1175 (N.D. Cal 1999) (Nehmer II); Nehmer et al v. Veterans Admin. of the Gov't of the U.S., 284 F. 3d 1158 (9th Cir. 2002) (Nehmer III).  For a Nehmer class member, the effective date can be earlier than the date of the liberalizing law under certain circumstances.  

On October 21, 2022, however, the Secretary of VA issued guidance for processing claims and appeals for disability compensation involving presumptive conditions following the enactment of the PACT Act.  The Secretary found that, after considering the full text of the PACT Act, VA was required to apply the Nehmer consent decree processes to claims related to service-connection presumptions that existed before enactment of the PACT Act.  However, VA was prevented from applying those processes to claims for conditions relating to service connection presumptions created on or after the PACT Act's enactment, such as hypertension.  As such, 38 C.F.R. § 3.816, codifying the Nehmer cases and consent decree, does not apply to a grant based on the PACT Act, as here.   

In light of the Veteran's August 3, 2021, claim, however, the Board has considered whether entitlement to service connection may have previously arisen on a basis other than under the PACT Act.  As for presumptive service connection for chronic diseases, hypertension was not manifest to a compensable degree within one year of service separation.  Additionally, as hypertension was not noted during service, characteristic manifestations of the disease processes were not identified, and the record does not indicate continuous hypertension since service discharge, the provisions of § 3.303(b) are not applicable.  See also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

As for direct service connection, the Veteran's service treatment records and examination reports are silent for diagnoses or treatment pertaining to hypertension, and his service separation examination at discharge did not show relevant abnormalities.  Rather, the Veteran's blood pressure measurement was 114/74, and he denied having a history of high or low blood pressure in the accompanying Report of Medical History.  Additionally, the probative evidence contains no indication that hypertension was directly incurred during active military service, including to any exposures therein, and the Veteran himself does not have the requisite medical knowledge, training, or experience to be able to render a competent medical opinion regarding the cause of such a medically complex disability as hypertension.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 437 (2011).  

38 C.F.R. § 3.400 provides that the proper effective date for an award of service connection "will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later."  Here, the underlying claim for service connection for hypertension was received on August 3, 2021.  The date "entitlement arose" for service connection for this disability, however, was August 10, 2022, when hypertension was added to the list of diseases eligible for presumptive service connection based on herbicide agent exposure.

Thus, August 10, 2022, serves the appropriate date for entitlement to service connection for hypertension, as this is the later date between the date of claim and the date entitlement arose.  There is simply no legal entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for this disability, and the claim must be denied.

2. A compensable disability rating for hypertension is denied.

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  The percentage ratings represent, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  

Generally, the degree of disability specified is considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. 

If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  Evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  

In the rating decision on appeal, the VA Regional Office granted service connection for hypertension and assigned a noncompensable rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101, a 10 percent rating is assigned with evidence of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent rating is assigned with evidence of diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.  A 40 percent rating is assigned with evidence of diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more.  A 60 percent rating is assigned with evidence of diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more.  

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that in considering whether a 10 percent rating may be assigned under Diagnostic Code 7101, the Board must examine historical blood pressure readings taken before the veteran began continuous hypertension medication, even if outside the appeal period.   Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021).

Turning to the evidence, on VA examination in October 2023, the examiner found that the Veteran's hypertension is not manifested by a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more.  On examination, his blood pressure was 139/54, 143/56, and 137/57.  The examiner noted the Veteran's hypertension did not require any medication for control.  The examiner stated that the Veteran had been off his medication for over three months, and found that his blood pressure readings were normal and that he no longer qualified for a diagnosis of hypertension.  

VA treatment records additionally document the following blood pressure readings: 137/63 (October 2019); 158/67 and 158/62 (November 2019); 123/63 (September 2020); 146/71 and 157/66 (November 2020); 136/69 (March 2021); 145/72 (April 2021); 121/80 (October 2021); 127/58 (November 2021); and 129/74 (December 2021).

At the December 2024 hearing, the Veteran and his spouse testified that his blood pressure readings are elevated, and that he requires medication for control.

Considering the pertinent evidence in light of the governing legal authority, the Board finds the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of a compensable disability rating for the Veteran's hypertension.  The October 2023 VA examiner explicitly determined that he does not have a history of diastolic pressure measuring predominantly 100 or higher.  That finding is consistent with the Veteran's treatment records, which contain no such measurement.  Further, the record does not contain a single systolic pressure measurement of 160 or higher.  As such, the criteria for a compensable rating have not been met.  

The Board can point to no other diagnostic code that would provide a basis for the assignment of a higher rating.  Thus, for the foregoing reasons, the Board finds the evidence is persuasively against a compensable rating for hypertension.  In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, the doctrine is not for application.

3. The appeal for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus is dismissed.

4. The appeal for an effective date earlier than August 3, 2021, for the award of service connection for diabetes mellitus is dismissed.

During the December 2024 hearing, the Veteran and his representative explicitly, unambiguously, and with a full understanding of the consequences, withdrew the appeals for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus, and an effective date earlier than August 3, 2021, for the award of service connection for that disability.  See Hearing Transcript pp. 2.

The undersigned explained that withdrawing the appeals meant that they would be dismissed and would not be decided with the claims remaining on appeal.  The Veteran, represented by a private attorney, confirmed his understanding of the impact of the dismissal and his desire to proceed with withdrawing the appeals.  The record thus demonstrates that the consequences of the withdrawals were fully understood.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011); Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific errors of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

Here, as the Veteran and his representative have withdrawn the appeals for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus, and an effective date earlier than August 3, 2021, for the award of service connection for that disability, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  The Board is not permitted to review the appeals and they are dismissed.
