ORDER

Service connection for vitiligo is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his vitiligo is at least as likely as not related to his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for vitiligo have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1997 to January 1998, and from October 2001 to December 2004. 

In the December 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Veteran is seeking service connection for vitiligo.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

First there is evidence of a current disability. In the November 2021 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran was diagnosed with vitiligo. Next, there is evidence of an in-service incurrence as he credibly reported that he first noticed skin discoloration to his arms, neck, anterior chest, back, and genitals in 2004 while on active duty. Finally, with respect to a nexus, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds his credible report of continuity of symptomology sufficient to establish a nexus for purposes of the third element of the service connection analysis as he is competent to report observable symptoms of skin discoloration, and is found credible in his reports. Accordingly, service connection is granted.
