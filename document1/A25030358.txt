DOCKET NO. 230120-315307
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On February 27, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from June 2005 to November 2005, January 2006 to June 2006, September 2007 to February 2008, June 2009 to December 2009, March 2011 to July 2011, and June 2015 to March 2016, to include service in Southwest Asia.  He also has additional periods of inactive service in the Air Force National Guard.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In his substantive appeal to the Board, the Veteran elected the evidence submission docket, which does not include request for hearing.  Nevertheless, the Board observes that, in a July 2024 statement, the Veteran formally withdrew/canceled a request for hearing. 

Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

As previously stated, in a February 2025 statement, the Veteran notified the Board that he wished to formally request the withdrawal of his appeal for docket number 230120-315307, which identifies the present appeal.  The Board finds the written withdrawal to be valid and sufficient to meet the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.    

In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the 

?

Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
