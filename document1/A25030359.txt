ORDER

New and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim of service connection for a low back disability (claimed as "disc degeneration of L3-L4 with swelling, and grade 1 listhesis at the L3-L4 and L4-L5").

Service connection for a low back disability (claimed as "disc degeneration of L3-L4 with swelling, and grade 1 listhesis at the L3-L4 and L4-L5") is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In an October 2022 rating decision, a VA Regional Office ("RO") denied service connection for a low back disability. The Veteran did not appeal this decision.

2. In May 2023, VA received evidence since the that tends to prove that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a low back disability and that the condition was incurred in service.

3. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his current low back disability originated in service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria to readjudicate the claim of service connection for a low back disability based on new and relevant evidence have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156 (d); 3.2501.

2. The criteria to establish service connection for a low back disability have been approximated. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from August 2013 to August 2022.

This matter is on appeal from a June 2023 rating decision by a VA Regional Office (RO). The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182 or "NOD") and selected the direct review docket.

Under the direct review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 decision on appeal. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the RO issued the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

If evidence was associated with the claim file during a period when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board did not consider it in its decision. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.   

New and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim of service connection for a low back disability (claimed as "disc degeneration of L3-L4 with swelling, and grade 1 listhesis at the L3-L4 and L4-L5").

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidenced is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d).

New evidence is evidence not previously part of the record before agency adjudicators. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1). Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim, including evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a) (2).

In an October 2022 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for a low back disability because the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of any low back condition. The Veteran did not appeal the October 2022 decision.

Evidence received since the October 2022 rating decision includes the Veteran's May 2023 Supplemental Claim Application ("VA Form 20-0995"), a May 2023 VA back conditions examination and medical opinion, and a May 2023 opinion from a non-VA medical provider diagnosing a chronic lumbar strain and linking the condition to the Veteran's military service.

In the June 2023 decision on appeal, the RO denied the Veteran's request to readjudicate the claim, stating that the May 2023 non-VA opinion was not relevant because it did not prove or disprove any matter at issue. 

However, the matters at issue include(d) whether the Veteran had a current low back diagnosis and, if so, whether the condition was linked to service. 

Accordingly, the May 2023 VA and non-VA medical examinations/opinions are both new and relevant, and readjudication is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a).

SERVICE CONNECTION

VA grants service connection for disabilities resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). "Direct" service connection requires: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus (a causal link) between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). Disorders diagnosed after discharge may still be service connected if the evidence establishes that the disorder was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d); see Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

For service connection purposes, a "current" disability means the disability was present at the time of filing the claim and/or during its pendency, even if the disability resolves before the claim is adjudicated. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); see also Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013) (recent diagnoses predating filing of claim are relevant evidence in determining whether a current disability existed at time claim was filed or during its pendency).

When the Board evaluates a claim, it must decide if the evidence is competent. "Competent" evidence comes from a person who is qualified to make a statement or opinion because of their training, education, or experience. 

For example, medical professionals are generally competent through training and experience to diagnose medical conditions and express opinions about whether a disability was caused by service. Generally, the opinions of medical professionals such as doctors, psychiatrists, nurses, and others who work in the health care field may be competent because they apparently have specialized training, as shown in the detail of their reports and knowledge of the facts in individual cases. 

A person without medical training (i.e., a "layperson") is generally not competent to diagnose complex medical conditions or give an opinion on the cause of a disease or injury. See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). For example, a layperson would not be competent to diagnose cancer or give an opinion that cancer was caused by an event during military service.

However, a layperson is competent to report symptoms that they observe firsthand through their senses. For example, a layperson does not need medical training to competently state that they have ringing in the ears, pain, a limp, a broken leg, difficulty breathing, or skin rashes. See Jandreau, Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). 

In deciding claims, the Board evaluates the entire record on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a). When the evidence fully supports the claim, it will be granted. When the evidence for and against the claim is approximately balanced, the Board resolves any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and grant the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3rd 1391 (2021).

Service connection for a low back disability (claimed as a lumbosacral strain) is granted.

The Veteran has been diagnosed with a lumbosacral strain and VA has recognized that he was treated for back pain and lumbar degenerative disc disease ("DDD") during active service. The sole question is whether the Veteran's current back disability was caused by service.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show reports of back pain and a diagnosis of "disc degeneration of L3-L4 with swelling, and grade 1 listhesis at the L3-L4 and L4-L5" in January 2020 MRI. 

In a March 2022 STR, the Veteran endorsed chronic low back pain since 2018.

At an October 2022 VA thoracolumbar spine (low back) conditions examination, the Veteran reported being told that he fractured his L4 vertebrae in 2016 and had recurrent back pain in 2019. He reported being told by medical providers that he had a "calcified" fracture with bone spur. However, the October 2022 VA examiner opined that X-rays taken in October 2022 were "within normal limits" and did not show any low back condition.

In May 2023, a non-VA medical provider diagnosed a chronic lumbar strain and opined that the condition was caused by the Veteran's in-service back injuries. 

In May 2023, a VA clinician diagnosed a lumbosacral strain but opined that the condition was not caused by service. The clinician opined that there was insufficient evidence to show a chronic back condition because the October 2022 VA examiner did not diagnose a back condition and opined that the Veteran's back was "normal." The examiner did not address the May 2023 non-VA opinion.

The Veteran has credibly and competently reported low back pain that began in service and continued (albeit intermittently at times) to the present. See Jandreau, above. As noted above, service connection does not require that a medical condition manifest with constant, uninterrupted symptoms. See McClain, above.  Additionally, the October 2022 and May 2023 VA opinions did not address the Veteran's competent reports of chronic back pain, the 2020 MRI showing lumbar DDD, or the positive May 2023 non-VA opinion. 

The Board will resolve the reasonable doubt regarding a current diagnosis of a lumbar spine disability and the link between the Veteran's back condition and service. The claim is granted.
