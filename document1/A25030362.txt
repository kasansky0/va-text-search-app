DOCKET NO. 210603-163861
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to retroactive Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) compensation payment has been withdrawn.

FINDING OF FACT

In a January 2025 written statement, the Veteran stated that he wanted to withdraw his March 31, 2025, hearing request and that the VA had satisfied his case.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to retroactive CRSC compensation payment have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 19.55.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1978 to August 2006.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In a January 2025 written statement, the Veteran stated that he wanted to withdraw his March 31, 2025, hearing request and that the VA had satisfied his case. The written correspondence included the Veteran's name, file number and reference to the December 26, 2024, letter which scheduled the Veteran's Board hearing for the claim for entitlement to retroactive CRSC compensation payment of $1,282.66. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's statement qualifies as a valid withdrawal of the appeal. Thus, the Veteran validly withdrew the claim and the appeal is dismissed. Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020).
