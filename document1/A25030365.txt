ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's sleep apnea had its onset in active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from January 12, 2010, to December 31, 2011; May 1, 2013, to September 30, 2013; and January 10, 2014, to September 30, 2014. 

By a June 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea was denied.  The Veteran submitted a June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), electing Direct Review of his claim; the Board may thus only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R.              § 20.301.  

If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the June 2023 rating decision on June 26, 2023, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R.              § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

Service connection will generally be awarded when a Veteran has a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

To establish service connection on a direct basis, the evidence must show (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a link or nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 252 (1999).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence as to any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA will resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

In his February 2023 claim, the Veteran asserted that he did not have sleep apnea until he returned from his first deployment in 2011.  

During VA treatment in April 2012, shortly after the Veteran's first period of active service, he sought to establish care with VA and reported snoring and waking to catch his breath.  He was referred for a sleep consultation.  In June 2012, the Veteran gave a history of difficulty falling and staying asleep, snoring, gasping/choking for air, stopping breathing while asleep, unrefreshing sleep and excessive sleepiness during the day.  A sleep study at that time showed moderate obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

During VA treatment in February 2023, the Veteran reported that he started snoring in late 2010 and that after his deployment he had a sleep study and was diagnosed with sleep apnea.  

In a June 2023 VA sleep apnea Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was related to his in-service participation in TERA on the basis that his other risk factors included his age, weight, and narrow airway.  The examiner noted that obstructive sleep apnea usually develops over time, that it can happen because of unhealthy lifestyle choices such as not getting enough exercise, obesity, decreased neck girth, and enlarged tonsils, and that there was no pathophysiological relationship between participation in TERA and obstructive sleep apnea.  However, the examiner did not provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea had its onset during service.

The Board finds the Veteran's statement that he began snoring during service in late 2010 to be both competent and credible.  Just four months following his separation from service, he sought treatment for symptoms of sleep apnea in April 2012.  A diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea was then confirmed by a sleep study in June 2012.  The June 2023 VA examiner noted that obstructive sleep apnea usually develops over time, which supports a finding that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was present prior to his initial treatment in April 2012, likely during his period of active duty from January 2010 to December 2011.

Given the Veteran's competent and credible statements that he began snoring during service in 2010 and his post-service treatment for sleep apnea just four months following his separation from service, along with the June 2023 VA examiner's statement that obstructive sleep apnea usually develops over time, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that his obstructive sleep apnea had its onset during service.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Accordingly, service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).
