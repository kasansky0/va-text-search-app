REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for right foot disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1982 to May 1982. He also was in the Army National Guard from December 1981 to April 2000.

This appeal stems from a March 2024 rating decision. Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the February 2024 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to service connection for right foot disability is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that he reported a pre-existing right foot contusion on December 7, 1996, that was aggravated during a period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) or inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA). See January 2023 VA Form 21-4138. He states that the aggravation occurred while he was on ACDUTRA after a Kankakee River flood in 1995, while he was on ACDUTRA in Korea in 1996, and/or when he was on ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA with the 113th Engineering Battalion in Gary, IN, and Michigan City, IN. Id.; see also January 2024 VA Form 21-4138. The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) contain a December 7, 1996, report of medical history stating that the Veteran had a work-related foot injury "three weeks ago" where a "newspaper skid" fell on his foot. A May 2023 VA medical opinion states that the Veteran's current right foot disability is most likely due to that injury. However, the Board finds that the record is not sufficiently complete for it to determine whether the Veteran aggravated that injury during a period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA.

Claimants are entitled to service connection for injuries that are aggravated during a period of active military service, which includes any period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA where the individual becomes disabled from an injury that is aggravated in the line of duty. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(24), 1110. This means that claimants must demonstrate "a permanent increase in disability beyond the nature progress of that" injury during the period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA. Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167, 174 (2010). It is the claimant's burden to demonstrate both that there was a permanent increase in the disability and that the increase was beyond the natural progress of that disability. Id.

The Board finds that remand is warranted to correct two pre-decisional duty to assist errors. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). First, although the Veteran asserts that he served on ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA in 1995 and 1996 and that his medical records document that his foot injury was aggravated during that time, his STRs and service personnel records (SPRs) do not corroborate these assertions. However, the Board observes that his STRs and SPRs contain large gaps of time with no documents, to include during 1995 and 1996, and they appear to be incomplete. In addition, although the AOJ found that the Veteran's active duty STRs were unavailable, it did not make such a finding regarding his National Guard STRs and SPRs. VA will make as many requests as possible to obtain records from a federal department or agency. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2). VA will only end these efforts if it concludes that the records do not exist or further efforts to obtain them would be futile. Id. If VA cannot obtain these records, it must notify the claimant. Id. § 3.159(e). Because the record does not indicate that VA undertook adequate efforts to obtain the Veteran's complete National Guard STRs and SPRs, the Board finds that remand is warranted.

Second, the May 2023 medical opinion is not adequate. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 20.802(a); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311-12 (2007) (holding that once VA provides a medical opinion in a service connection claim, it must ensure that it is adequate). The examiner opined that the Veteran's current disability is due to a 1996 work injury. However, the examiner did not provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's injury was aggravated during a period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA. Therefore, remand is warranted to obtain an adequate medical opinion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Undertake reasonable efforts to obtain the Veteran's complete National Guard STRs and SPRs from the appropriate sources. The AOJ will discontinue such efforts only if it concludes that the records do not exist or that further searches would be futile. The AOJ will appropriately document its efforts in the Veteran's electronic claims file. If the AOJ cannot obtain the records, it must provide the Veteran with oral or written notice and document this notice in the Veteran's electronic claims file.

2. After remand instruction 1. is completed, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate medical professional for the right foot disability. The Veteran's electronic claims file, including a copy of this remand, must be accessible to the designated professional for review. The examiner must provide a detailed rationale for any opinion that he or she provides, and the opinion must state that the examiner has reviewed the Veteran's electronic claims file and this remand.

After examining the Veteran and reviewing the claims file, the examiner must respond to the following:

(a) Is it at least as likely as not (at least approximately balanced or nearly equal) that the Veteran's right foot disability permanently increased in severity during a period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA?

(b) If the Veteran's right foot disability permanently increased in severity during a period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA, is it at least as likely as not (at least approximately balanced or nearly equal) that the permanent increase in severity is beyond the natural progress of the foot disability?

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for all findings and opinions, and a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved would be of considerable assistance to the Board.
