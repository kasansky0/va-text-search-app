REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1972 to September 1974.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran elected the Board's Direct Review docket.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182.  This restricts the Board's review to the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that evidence was associated with the claims file after the November 2023 rating decision on appeal, which was during a period of time that is outside the applicable evidentiary window.  However, as the claim is being remanded, the AOJ will consider the claim in light of the entire claims file upon remand.

Entitlement to service connection for COPD is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that entitlement to service connection for COPD is warranted.

The Board finds that a remand is needed due to multiple pre-decisional duty to assist errors.

First, the Veteran previously reported daily asbestos exposure during active service from daily duties and that asbestos exposure led to COPD.  See July 2023 Fully Developed Claim.  However, it does not appear that any efforts were made by VA to attempt to verify asbestos exposure.  This is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  Therefore, a remand is needed to attempt to verify asbestos exposure.

Second, evidence of record appears to show that relevant medical documents are in VA's possession but have not been added to the claims file.  Specifically, VA treatment records show that a January 2019 chest x-ray and a January 2019 spirometry report were available in Vista Imaging.  See October 2023 CAPRI.  However, such documents are not in the claims file.  This is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  Therefore, a remand is needed to add these documents to the claims file.

Third, evidence of record appears to show that the Veteran had a private provider called Hayden Lake Family Physicians (or Hayden Family Physicians), and that documents from that provider had been received by VA.  See October 2023 CAPRI.  It is reasonable to believe that the Veteran may have been referred for the January 2019 testing mentioned above by that private physician.  As such, these documents may be relevant.  However, such documents are not in the claims file.  This is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  Therefore, a remand is needed to add these documents to the claims file.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Contact all appropriate sources to attempt to verify the Veteran's assertion of exposure to asbestos during active service.  All attempts and all responses received should be documented in the claims file.

2. Associate the (a) January 2019 chest x-ray, (b) January 2019 spirometry report, and (c) the documents from Hayden Lake Family Physicians (or Hayden Family Physicians) already in VA's possession from the Vista Imaging system, or other similar system, with the claims file.
