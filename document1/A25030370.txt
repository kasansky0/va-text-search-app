ORDER

The appeal concerning the removal of the Veteran's spouse as a dependent is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a March 2025 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran withdrew this appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal concerning the removal of the Veteran's spouse as a dependent have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1971 to June 1974. 

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2024 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal which was received in November 2024, and selected the Evidence Submission docket. The case was docketed at the Board in January 2025.

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration regarding the issue on appeal. In the March 2025 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran clearly stated that he does not wish to pursue this appeal. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
