ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for rhinitis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's rhinitis is related to his period of active service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for rhinitis have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1993 to June 1998. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the February 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Rhinitis

The Veteran asserts that his rhinitis is the result of his time on active duty in the United States Navy.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Generally, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service; and (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In adjudicating these claims, the Board must assess the competence and credibility of the Veteran. Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005). Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology and "may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection." Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 405 (1995) (lay person competent to testify to pain and visible flatness of his feet).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

The Veteran was diagnosed with allergic rhinitis in an August 2020 VA examination. The Board notes that an October 2021 VA examiner found no evidence of a current rhinitis disability. However, the Court has previously held that the requirement that a claimant have a current disability before service connection may be awarded for that disability is also satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim, even if no disability is present at the time of the claim's adjudication. McClain v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?319 (2007). Given that the overall medical evidence both prior to and after the October 2021 VA examination shows that the Veteran did have a current rhinitis disability, the Board finds that the Veteran had a current disability during the pendency of the claim. Thus, the first element of service connection has been met. 

February 1994 service treatment records document the Veteran being treated for complaints of sinus congestion and a diagnosis of an upper respiratory infection while he was serving on active duty. In the Veteran's May 1998 Report of Medical History at his separation examination, the Veteran documented suffering from frequent colds and sinus congestion. Additionally, the AOJ made favorable findings that the Veteran served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), and was exposed to burn pits during military service. Thus, the second element of service connection has been met. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in August 2020. The VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with allergic rhinitis. The Veteran asserted that his symptoms began in 1998 while he was serving on active duty. The Veteran complained of nasal congestion which had begun after the Veteran returned from deployment in the Southwest Asia theater of operations. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's diagnosed allergic rhinitis was related to a specific exposure event experienced by the Veteran during service in Southwest Asia. The VA examiner noted that allergic rhinitis is a disease with a clear etiology of inflammation of the nasopharyngeal passages due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. However, there was a potential link to Southwest Asia toxins as potential nasopharyngeal exposure due to burn pits in the Gulf. 

The Board affords the August 2020 VA examination and opinion high probative weight because it addresses the Veteran's contentions and includes a review of his medical and military occupational history.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2021. As previously noted, the VA examiner found the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of rhinitis. However, the examiner did not provide an opinion on etiology. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2022. The VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with chronic nasal congestion. The Veteran asserted that his symptoms began in 1998 while he was still on active duty. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's chronic nasal congestion was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service event, injury, or illness. The VA examiner noted that based on a review of the available evidence, it was less likely than not that the claimed condition was due to service as there was scant data supporting a nexus between the current diagnosis of chronic nasal congestion and military service. Without chronicity during service or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology. 

In a July 2023 VA medical opinion, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. Additionally, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity(ies), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's service treatment records and May 1998 Report of Medical History. The VA examiner noted there was insufficient evidence and a lack of chronicity to confirm treatment. 

The Board affords the November 2022 and July 2023 VA examinations and opinions no probative weight. The VA examiners did not address the Veteran's contentions that he suffered from symptoms of rhinitis beginning during his time on active duty. As such, the opinion is inadequate as the VA examiner failed to adequately address the lay reports of in-service symptoms and all symptoms thereafter. See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 258-260 (2020) (stating a VA examiner's failure to consider the veteran's relevant lay statements when formulating an opinion renders the opinion inadequate). The VA examiners relied on a lack of medical documentation in his opinion. Solely relying on the lack of medical documentation in service cannot serve as the basis for the opinion provided. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (holding that an examination was inadequate where the examiner did not comment on a Veteran's report of in-service injury and instead relied on the lack of evidence in the service treatment records to provide a negative opinion).

The Veteran is competent to report his symptoms of rhinitis both during and after service. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). The Board finds little reason to doubt the credibility of his statements other than a lack of contemporaneous medical evidence while he was in service. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Indeed, his reports regarding his symptoms have been consistent throughout the appeal. Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran is credible in his reporting of continuous symptoms since service.

The Board acknowledges the negative opinions provided by the November 2022 and July 2023 VA examiners. However, the Board gives more weight to the positive opinion provided by the August 2020 VA examiner and the Veteran's lay statements. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's rhinitis was incurred in service. Accordingly, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is for application and the claim for service connection for rhinitis is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
