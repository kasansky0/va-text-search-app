ORDER

An effective date prior to August 30, 2023, for a 30 percent rating for left knee arthritis is denied. 

An effective date prior to August 30, 2023, for a 30 percent rating for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome (right knee disability) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to VA's August 30, 2023, receipt of the Veteran's intent to file, there were no pending requests for higher ratings for his bilateral knee disabilities that were unadjudicated and the evidence does not demonstrate that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period prior to August 30, 2023. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to August 30, 2023, for a 30 percent rating for left knee arthritis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to August 30, 2023, for a 30 percent rating for a right knee disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1997 to March 2000.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Dates

The method of determining the effective date of an increased evaluation is set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) and (b)(2), and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). The general rule with respect to the effective date of an award of increased compensation is that the effective date of such award "shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application thereof." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). This statutory provision is implemented by regulation which provides that the effective date for an award of increased compensation will be the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).

An exception to the rule applies, however, under circumstances where evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation. In that regard, the law provides that the effective date of the award "shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date, otherwise the date of receipt of the claim." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). The phrase "otherwise, date of receipt of claim" applies only if a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within one year prior to filing the claim for an increased rating. Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997). Moreover, the term "increase" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 means an increase to the next disability level. See Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997).

A previous determination which is final, and binding will be accepted as correct in the absence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a). CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error." It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. Additionally, simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE. Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error." Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993).

Left Knee

Right Knee

As to the Veteran's left knee, the record shows that he sought service connection for the disability in June 2008. He was granted service connection via an October 2013 Board Decision. An October 2013 rating decision implemented the Board's grant and assigned a non-compensable (0%) rating. A July 2014 rating decision assigned a 10 percent rating for the Veteran's left knee disability as of his June 2008 grant of service connection. The Veteran did not appeal this decision and it became final. 

As to the Veteran's right knee, the record shows that a May 2016 rating decision granted service connection as of June 2008 and assigned a 10 percent rating. The Veteran did not appeal this decision and it became final.

In August 2023, the VA received an intent to file from the Veteran and in November 2023 he filed a Fully Developed Claim seeking higher ratings for his bilateral knee disabilities. The March 2024 rating decision on appeal assigned 30 percent rating for his knee disabilities as of his August 2023 intent to file. 

The Veteran states that his 30 percent rating should go back to his original June 2008 claim, indicating that VA examinations were not performed to properly assess the severity of his knee disabilities at the time service connection was granted. See July 2024 correspondence. 

However, the regulations are clear. The prior rating decisions which assigned the Veteran's 10 percent ratings became final when the Veteran did not appeal those decisions. There is no mechanism by which the Board can retroactively apply the increased ratings for his knees back to his 2008 grant of service connection. In this matter, the earliest effective date possible for the Veteran would be the year prior to his August 2023 intent to file, should the record show that there was an ascertainable increase in his disability. 

After review of the record, the Board cannot find that the evidence shows such an increase prior to his August 2023 claim. Here, the Veteran's VA medical records show that he consistently stated he had knee pain, but there are no records received by VA or generated by VA which show any increase in his knee disabilities or an increase in the limitations caused by his knee disabilities prior to his August 2023 intent to file. Thus, there is no earlier date available upon which the Board could grant higher ratings for his bilateral knee disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Furthermore, the Board cannot find that the Veteran's statement that the AOJ failed to perform VA examinations rises to the level of a CUE claim. As noted above, CUE is a very specific allegation which must go beyond claims of prior adjudication's failure to obtain VA examinations. Thus, the Board cannot find that the Veteran's July 2024 statement rises to the level of a claim of CUE in prior rating decisions. 

As such and based on the foregoing, the Board finds that persuasive evidence of record is against the claim. Accordingly, as the persuasive evidence of record is against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application, and the claim must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
