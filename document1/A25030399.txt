ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's bladder cancer was etiologically related to in-service asbestos exposure.

2. The Veteran passed away in October 2022.

3. His principal cause of death was bladder cancer. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1310 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.5, 3.303, 3.312 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1959 to December 1968. The Veteran passed away in October 2022 and the appellant is his widow. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2024 Rating Decision, issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the December 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the appellant elected the Evidence Submission docket. The appellant also listed the issues as "cause of death" and "DIC." Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is a type of Dependents Indemnity Compensation (DIC). See generally 38 U.S.C. Chapter 13. The appellant has made no argument regarding the other specific form of DIC available to surviving spouses. See 38 U.S.C. § 1318. Moreover, the award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death moots the other forms of DIC to which the appellant might have been entitled. Therefore, the Board finds the appellant's appeal is only as to entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant or her representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for cause of death.

The appellant contends that the Veteran's bladder cancer caused the Veteran's death and that the bladder cancer is due to in-service toxic exposure activities. When a veteran dies from a service-connected disability, the veteran's surviving spouse may be entitled to DIC benefits for the cause of death. 38 U.S.C. § 1310; 38 C.F.R. § 3.5(a), 3.312. In order to establish service connection for the cause of death, the evidence must show that a disability incurred in or aggravated by service was either the principal cause of death or contributed substantially or materially to the veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312.

For a service-connected disability to constitute a contributory cause of death, it must be shown to have contributed substantially or materially to the Veteran's death; combined to cause death; aided or lent assistance to the production of death; or resulted in debilitating effects and general impairment of health to an extent that would render the Veteran materially less capable of resisting the effects of other disease or injury causing death, as opposed to merely sharing in the production of death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312.

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 113, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The AOJ's June 2024 Rating Decision contained a favorable finding that the Veteran was diagnosed with bladder cancer. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). As such, the first element of service connection is met. Additionally, when the Veteran passed away in October 2022, his immediate cause of death was end-stage renal disease and bladder cancer. See November 2022 Death Certificate.

Benefits may be awarded when the Veteran died from a disability deemed to be related to a period of active service from which he received a qualifying discharge. 38 U.S.C. § 1310(b). The Veteran's death will be considered to have been due to a service-connected disability when there is evidence that the service-connected disability was either the principal or contributory cause of death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(a). 

An October 2024 internal VA memorandum found that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) based on his military occupational specialty's exposure to asbestos. Thus, the second element of service connection is met. 

The Board now turns to the final element of service connection, whether there is a nexus between the diagnosis and the in-service incurrence of an injury or disease.  

The appellant was afforded a medical opinion and TERA medical opinion for the Veteran in July 2023. Each came back with a finding that the Veteran's bladder cancer was less likely than not incurred in or caused by exposure to asbestos. The rationale provided for each was that there is no objective medical evidence to support a causal relationship for the Veteran's end stage renal disease due to his exposure to asbestos. Additionally, the examiner noted the Veteran had a history of smoking, which is a significant factor for developing bladder cancer. See July 2023 C&P Exams. 

The appellant submitted a timely private medical opinion in March 2025. The private examiner found that it is at least likely as not that the Veteran's bladder cancer was caused by or incurred during his military service exposure to hazardous chemicals while in the service. The examiner provided a medical narrative of the Veteran's history and a discussion of the medical principles and analysis involved in his opinion. See March 2025 Medical Treatment Record. 

The Board affords the private opinion great probative weight. The examiner showed that they reviewed the Veteran's file, reported the medical principles used in their opinion, cited the medical studies they used, discussed the pathophysiology of the condition, addressed the concerns of the prior VA medical opinions, and methodically showed the medical analysis they used. The Board affords the VA medical opinions less probative weight as their rationales do not provide sufficient detail to show the Board they considered the Veteran's facts and applied an expert medical judgment to them to reach the conclusion submitted. Although numerous medical articles were cited, it was not shown that the examiners applied the medical principles and analysis to this Veteran's conditions. 

In the reasoned March 2025 private medical opinion, the private examiner opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's military service exposure to hazardous chemicals led to his bladder cancer, which was a principal cause of his death. See March 2025 Medical Treatment Record.

The evidence demonstrates persuasively that the cause of the Veteran's death was from bladder cancer which was related to an in-service toxic exposure. As such, the claim for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, and subsequent DIC benefits, is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 1310; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.5; 3.312.
