ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Tinnitus has been shown to have originated in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from November 1986 to July 1995.

In August 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for tinnitus.  In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Service connection for Tinnitus.

The Veteran asserts that service connection for tinnitus is warranted as the claimed disability was due to noise exposure during active service. 

Service connection may be established for recurrent disability arising from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

 Service treatment records do not refer to tinnitus or ringing of the ears.  The personnel records convey that the Veteran served in the Navy and her military occupational specialty was an electrical mate.

In the March 2024 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction made a favorable finding that the Veteran's military occupational specialty had "a high probability of hazardous noise exposure."  

The report of an April 2022 audiology examination conducted for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) revealed that the Veteran complained of tinnitus.  She reported experiencing the onset of tinnitus "3 years after separation."  The Veteran was diagnosed with tinnitus.

A June 2023 evaluation from  D. Palmer, R.N., states that the Veteran's records were reviewed.  Mr. Palmer concluded that "the Veteran's current auditory condition to include bilateral tinnitus is at least as likely as not (a 50%/50% probability) due to and/or related to military acoustic trauma during active duty military service."  He noted that medical journal articles conveyed that tinnitus occurred due to cochlear deterioration and damage as a result of acoustic trauma."  

The record is in at least equipoise as to whether the diagnosed tinnitus originated during active service.  The Veteran served in the Navy as an electrical mate and her hazard noise exposure while preforming her military duties has been conceded by VA.  She has been diagnosed with tinnitus by VA and private examiners.  Mr. Palmer concluded that the diagnosed tinnitus was related to the Veteran's conceded in service hazardous noise exposure.  Upon resolution of all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
