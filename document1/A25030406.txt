REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a thoracolumbar spine disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2020 to October 2021.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for the reasons that follow, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in its readjudication.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service connection for a thoracolumbar spine disability is remanded.

Unless the issue or issues can be granted in full, the Board shall remand the appeal to the AOJ for correction of an error on the part of the AOJ to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. 5103A if the error occurred prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction decision on appeal.? 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).? The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.? Id.? The remand must specify the action to be taken by the AOJ.? Id.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a "mid/lower back" disability.  See May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  A VA examiner in September 2023 diagnosed the Veteran with mild dextroscoliosis.  

It is the Veteran's assertion that her back pain began after undergoing a lumbar puncture in service, i.e., a spinal tap, for the purposes of determining the nature of severe headaches that she was experiencing in June 2020.  

Her service treatment records (STRs) show that a lumbar puncture was performed on June 17, 2020; a 20-gauge 3.5-inch spinal needle was placed in the L4 lumbar interspace. On the first attempt, no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained despite good landmarks.  The Veteran was not agreeable to second attempt.  

The Veteran reported experiencing low back pain on June 18, 2020, following an unsuccessful lumbar tap the day prior.  On examination, there was tenderness to palpation at paraspinals L3-L5 and the site of lumbar puncture.  

The Veteran again sought treatment for low back pain on June 20, 2020, wherein it was noted that it was "likely musculature vs. bony pathology and likely related to LP that was performed."  The Veteran had tenderness to palpation along L2-L4 midline and at the right paraspinal muscle, as well as pain with straight leg raising and hip flexion.  Thereafter, the Veteran sought treatment for low back pain on July 9, 2020.

While a VA examiner provided the negative opinion that the Veteran's dextroscoliosis was less likely than not "incurred in or caused by the claimed in- service injury, event, or illness," the Board finds the examiner's rationale that "the cause of dextroscoliosis is not known" to be insufficient.  The examiner failed to address the Veteran's assertions that her back pain began after her in-service spinal tap, as well as the fact that evaluation of the Veteran's spine during her service entrance examination was normal.  An addendum medical opinion is therefore necessary. 

The matters is therefore REMANDED for the following action:

Send the claims file to an appropriate examiner to offer an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's current back disability had its onset during service or is otherwise related to any incident of service, to include the unsuccessful lumbar puncture on June 17, 2020.  

The examiner should consider the statements from the Veteran regarding her history of back symptoms during and since service.  Specifically, the Veteran has stated that her back pain began after her in-service spinal tap on June 17, 2020, and that she suffers from these same symptoms currently and since service.  

The examiner should also consider the Veteran's service treatment records, including the June 17, 2020 record showing an unsuccessful spinal tap and the subsequent treatment records dated on June 18, 2020, June 20, 2020, and July 9, 2020 showing complaints of low back pain.  The June 20, 2020 included findings of tenderness to palpation along L2-L4 midline and at the right paraspinal muscle, as well as pain with straight leg raising and hip flexion.

The need for an additional physical examination is left to the discretion of the examiner.  

A rationale for all opinions offered is requested as adjudicators are precluded from making any medical findings.
