DOCKET NO. 210921-187089
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 (DEA) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran testified at a March 2025 hearing that he wished to withdraw from appellate review the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility to DEA.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal are met; the Board does not have authority to review the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility to DEA.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service with the United States Marine Corps from June 1980 to June 1984.  This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2021 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In September 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD, seeking review at the Board on the Hearing docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  Under the Hearing docket, the Board considers the evidence of record before the AOJ, as well as evidence submitted at or int eh 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.  In March 2025, the Veteran had a Board hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).  A transcript of that hearing is of record as of the date of this decision.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 19.55.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  The Board notes that as of February 2021, language explicitly permitting withdrawals on the record at hearing were deleted from the regulation; however, it is not barred.  

The Veteran testified at his March 2025 hearing that he wished to withdraw from appellate review his claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility to DEA. His representative explained that while the appeal was pending, AOJ decisions had resulted in an award of eligibility for DEA from August 7, 2019, the date the Veteran was seeking.  The VLJ verified the Veteran's wishes on the record and explained the consequences of withdrawal, and the Veteran stated that he still wished to withdraw the claim.  Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration of these issues. 

Accordingly, the Board does not have authority to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
