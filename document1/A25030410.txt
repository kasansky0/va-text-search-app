ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

1. A September 2023 Rating Decision denied entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction.  This rating decision was subsequently subject to Higher-Level Review by a November 2023 request and again denied in December 2023. 

2. The Veteran submitted a June 2024 VA Form 21-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the September 2023 rating decision identifying the issue as entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction, which has not yet been provided.

3. The Veteran submitted a subsequent VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) in June 2024 electing the direct review docket, identifying the September 2023 rating decision as the decision on appeal, and identifying the issue as entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction.

4. The Veteran's appeals for service connection for erectile dysfunction are currently pending under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) and concurrent election is prohibited.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1992 to July 1992 and from May 1993 to January 2000.

This matter was initially denied in a September 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In November 2023, the Veteran requested HLR of the September 2023 denial of service connection for erectile dysfunction.  The AOJ again denied the Veteran's claim in a December 2023 rating decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision.

In June 2024 the Veteran again requested HLR of the September 2023 rating decision.  This request has not yet been adjudicated or otherwise withdrawn.

Subsequently in June 2024, the Veteran timely submitted an NOD seeking appeal of the September 2023 rating decision.  The Veteran checked "direct review" by a Veterans Law Judge.  Therefore, any evidence submitted after the September 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher level review, cannot be considered by the Board.? 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.?

1. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is dismissed.

The Veteran seeks service connection for erectile dysfunction as secondary to his service-connected unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress.

As previously noted, the Veteran submitted an HLR request regarding the September 2023 rating decision on June 2, 2024.  The Veteran subsequently filed the instant appeal on June 11, 2024, also in regard to the September 2023 rating decision.

Under the AMA, there are three review lanes: HLR, Supplemental Claim, or an appeal to the Board.  If a request for review under one of these three lanes is pending, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different lane without first withdrawing the pending request.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b), (d), (e).  The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) has confirmed this regulatory prohibition against concurrent election, holding that a Veteran may select more than one review option under 38 C.F.R. 3.2500 only so long as the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option.  See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).

Here, the Veteran did not withdraw the June 2024 HLR request, and it was still pending when the June 2024 NOD was received.  Therefore, the Veteran's request for a review under a different lane (Board appeal Direct Review) was an impermissible concurrent election.  It was docketed erroneously.

Notably, an HLR decision has not been issued following the June 2024 request.  In its review of the record, Board notes the positive, private medical nexus opinion submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.  See  Medical Opinion, received February 21, 2023.  The Board also notes the August 2023 VA examination of record which found that available research indicates erectile dysfunction is primarily caused by vascular, and secondarily by psychogenic causes.  Although the Board is required to dismiss the Veteran's appeal as a matter of law, as the AOJ has not yet issued a decision, any evidence the Board has not considered will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the Veteran's June 2024 HLR request if a duty to assist error is found.

As such, there being no justiciable case or controversy, this appeal is dismissed as a matter of law, as concurrent review elections are prohibited.  38 C.F.R.  § 20.201.
