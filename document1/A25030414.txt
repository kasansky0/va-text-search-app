ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a gallbladder disability, to include residuals of a cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a diagnosis of prostate cancer at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. 

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a diagnosis of hypertension at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. 

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a gallbladder disability, or a disability manifested by the removal of his gallbladder at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for a gallbladder disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1966 to April 1970.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket, and a hearing was held by the undersigned in December 2024.  A transcript of the hearing testimony has been associated with the claims file.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Generally, in order to establish service connection, there must be competent and credible evidence demonstrating (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus or link between the in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Generally, a veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by his senses; however, a veteran is not competent to prove a matter requiring medical expertise.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter (which includes but is not limited to equipoise), VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 778 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Service connection for prostate cancer. 

Service connection for hypertension.

Service connection for a gallbladder disability.

The Veteran claims he is entitled to service connection for prostate cancer, hypertension, and a gallbladder disability due to exposure to herbicide agents in Vietnam.  See August 2023 VA 21-526EZ.  In the alternative, he asserts his gallbladder disability is directly related to service.  Specifically, he and his representative testified that he encountered food poisoning and stomach symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, cramps, and diarrhea during service.  See December 2024 Hearing Transcript.

In the July 2024 rating decision, the RO made a favorable finding that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during his service.  The RO conceded that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) and was exposed to herbicides as a result of service in the Republic of Vietnam.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).

Turning to the first element of service connection, current disability, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of prostate cancer, hypertension, or a gallbladder disability, (to include a disability manifested by removal of his gallbladder) and has not had one at any time during the period on appeal. 

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not contain any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis relevant to prostate cancer, hypertension, or a gallbladder disability.  Significantly, he denied all relevant symptoms and reported no gallbladder trouble or gall stones on his separation examination.  See March 1970 Separation Examination.  

A review of the Veteran's post service treatment records during the current review period are negative for a diagnosis of prostate cancer, hypertension, or a gallbladder disability. 

During his December 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2001 and he had it removed in 2002.  He added that he started receiving treatment for hypertension in 1972 and he has been receiving treatment for hypertension from his current physician since 2010.  He also testified that he was hospitalized for food poisoning during service and his gallbladder disability may be related to the stomach problems it caused.  His representative added that his STRs noted multiple stomach problems such as stomach pain, stomach cramps, and diarrhea.  However, the Veteran also noted that he didn't have any stomach problems after service until 1994.   

Considering the above, the Board finds there is no evidence of record establishing the current disability element of these claims.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) (absent proof of a current disability, there is no valid claim).

The Board is aware that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination in connection with these three service connection claims.  However, to trigger the duty to obtain a VA examination, there must be competent evidence of a current disability and that such is associated with service.  Pursuant to McLendon v. Nicholson, a VA examination must be provided when there is: (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing an event, injury or disease occurred in-service, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or current symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) there is insufficient competent evidence of record to make a decision on the claim.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).  

In this instance, there is no competent lay or medical evidence of record establishing a current disability for any claim.  The Board notes under the AMA, it can only remand a claim to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  In this case, there is no error, as the Veteran did not submit evidence of current disabilities during the appeal period.

While the Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements, unfortunately, the record does not reflect that the Veteran has the requisite training or expertise to offer a medical diagnosis.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  A medical diagnosis of prostate cancer, hypertension, and a gallbladder disability requires an internal medical process which extends beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship.  Opinions of this type have been found to be beyond the competence of lay witnesses, as is the Veteran.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ("sometimes the layperson will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer").

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's STRs noted blood pressure readings of 138/66, 120/80, and 138/86.  See June 1966, April 1969, and March 1970 STRs.  However, to the extent that he may believe his blood pressure readings during service were symptoms of hypertension, there is no evidence of a current diagnosis, and the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis.  Again, the issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education and the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).      

In light of the above, the Board finds that the probative evidence of record does not demonstrate that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of prostate cancer, hypertension, or a gallbladder disability and it finds that the first element of service connection has not been met for all three claims.  In the absence of evidence of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223.225 (1992).

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328 (1997).  The evidence must show that the Veteran currently has the disability for which benefits are being claimed.  As such, the Veteran cannot establish service connection for prostate cancer, hypertension, or a gallbladder disability. 

                                                                           (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)

In reaching the above decisions, the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt; however, as the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claims, the doctrine does not apply.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021), 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.
