REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for COVID-19 with residual shortness of breath (claimed as lung condition) is remanded.

Entitlement to increased evaluation in excess of 20 percent for intervertebral disc syndrome (previously rated as low grade non compressive disc bulges at L4-L5, L5-S1) (IVDS) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served honorably on active duty from December 2005 to December 2011. 

Entitlement to service connection for COVID-19 with residual shortness of breath (claimed as lung condition) is remanded.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a May 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the September 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Veteran contends he suffers from a lung condition due to his military service. See December 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.

The Board cannot make a fully-informed decision on the issue of entitlement to residuals of COVID-19 because no VA examiner has opined whether it is a direct result of the Veteran's toxic exposure. The examiner must opine as to whether there is a direct relationship between the Veteran's COVID-19 and his service. Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (holding that presumptive service connection procedures do not foreclose entitlement under a theory of direct service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.). The lack of an opinion discussing direct causation is a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R. 3.159(c)(4). Remand is therefore required. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. 

Entitlement to increased evaluation in excess of 20 percent IVDS is remanded.

This matter comes to the Board on appeal from a May 2023 rating decision issued by the AOJ. 

The Veteran requested a higher-level review of the May 2023 decision. Accordingly, the AOJ issued an August 2023 higher-level rating decision that again denied an increased rating. The Veteran purported to appeal both the May 2023 ("Evaluation of IVDS, which is currently 10 percent disabling, is increased to 20 percent effective December 9, 2022.") and August 2023 rating decision ("Entitlement to increased evaluation of IVDS currently evaluated as 20 percent disabling is denied.") in his VA Form 10182. However, both rating decisions adjudicated the same issue and, because the higher-level review only reviewed the evidence available at the time of the May 2023 rating decision, the evidence on appeal was the same. The two appealed issues are therefore duplicative and will only be listed once here. 

In the September 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of May 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to an increased rating for IVDS, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Veteran contends he is not adequately compensated for his IVDS by his assigned 20 percent rating. 

During the pendency of this claim, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decided Ingram v. Collins, in which the Court stated: "because the applicable diagnostic codes (DCs) and special musculoskeletal regulations do not reference medication, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects when assigning an evaluation." No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (Vet. App. Mar. 12, 2025); see also Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012).

During his January 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he takes medication, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for his IVDS. The Board must therefore remand this matter for a medical opinion as to the ameliorative effects, if any, of the medication that the Veteran takes for his IVDS. Consideration must also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's residuals of COVID-19 is at least as likely as not related or aggravated by his military service. The examiner should discuss whether: 

(a.) The Veteran's disability is a direct result of his presumed exposure to fine particulate matter.

(b.) any diagnosed condition involving the Veteran's lungs are due to the combined synergistic effect of the Veteran's total potential toxic exposure in service.

2. Afford the Veteran for a VA examination to assess the nature and severity of his service-connected IVDS. The entire claims file must be provided to, and reviewed by, the examiner, and any indicated tests, studies, or evaluations should be performed.

3. After review of the claims file, and examination of the Veteran, the examiner is asked to provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's IVDS under the applicable DC. The examiner must attempt to elicit information regarding the severity, frequency, and duration of symptoms during the appeal period. To the extent possible, the examiner should identify any symptoms and impairments due to the service-connected disability being assessed, including the impact on occupational functioning and activities of daily living.

4. In addressing the severity of the Veteran's IVDS, the examiner is instructed to consider and specifically address: 

(a.) whether any medications the Veteran uses or has used during the appeal period affect or affected the severity of his IVDS. If so, please identify each medication and clearly explain how such medication affects the condition, and 

(b.) if any such medication is productive of ameliorative effects, clearly identify such effects and opine as to the severity of the condition absent such medication.

5. The examiner should opine, pursuant to DeLuca v. Brown, whether the Veteran would have reduced functional limitation without the ameliorative effect of medication. If so, the examiner should estimate as to what the functionally equivalent ROM is to the Veteran's functional limitations. In other words, the medical examiner should determine whether the Veteran's spine would exhibit weakened movement, excess fatigability, or incoordination, in the absence of medication. These determinations should, if feasible, be expressed in terms of the degree of additional range-of-motion loss due to any weakened movement, excess fatigability, or incoordination

6. A complete rationale must be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed. If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
