DOCKET NO. 240510-439053
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for degenerative lumbosacral spine condition is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The January 20, 2024, rating decision implementing a January 17, 2024, Board decision was not an appealable decision.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of TDIU is dismissed as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from May 1987 until his honorable discharge in May 1996.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 20024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for degenerative lumbosacral spine condition is dismissed.

As an initial matter, in January 2024, the Board issued a decision granting a 40 percent disability rating for degenerative lumbosacral spine condition, effective October 1, 2017.  In the January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the Board's January 2024 decision.

Despite the January 2020 rating decision merely implementing the Board's decision with respect to entitlement to a 40 percent disability rating for degenerative lumbosacral spine condition, effective October 1, 2017, the Veteran appealed the January 2024 rating decision.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) issued a precedential panel decision in Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (2023).  In its holding, CAVC stated that an AOJ decision implementing a Board grant is not a "decision" the Board has the authority to review under 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).

Here, the January 2024 rating decision merely implemented the Board's January 2024 decision.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's May 2024 submission was improper with regard to appealing the RO's mere implementation of the Board's grant orders and, as such, dismissal of the Veteran's appeal with respect to this issue is appropriate under the circumstances.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).
