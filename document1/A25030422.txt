ORDER

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for heart condition, to include ischemic heart disease is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The March 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement listed the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss that had already been granted.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

As the service connection claim for bilateral hearing loss has already been granted there remains no justiciable case or controversy before the Board at this time. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.7, 20.101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1948 to July 1949 and from October 1950 to May 1952, with additional periods of service in the Marine Corps Reserves. The Veteran died in April 2024 and his spouse has been properly substituted as the appellant. 

This appeal stems from an April 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which denied service connection for a lung disease, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a heart condition, to include ischemic heart disease. 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on August 6, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for a heart condition, a psychiatric disorder, and prostate cancer any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Dismissal

The Board has jurisdiction where there is a question of law or fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary of VA under a law that affects the provision of benefits administered by VA. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.101. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5).

Regarding what issues are appealed in a VA Form 10182, the Board "will construe such arguments in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal, but the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees." 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

Here, in the March 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran specifically listed the issue as service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  By doing so, he listed an issue that has already been granted in a July 2023 rating decision on appeal. The Board considered whether to liberally construe the 10182 as an appeal of the July 2023 rating decision. In this regard, however, the Veteran did not express any disagreement with the already assigned rating or effective date for the claimed adjudicated service-connected disability. Furthermore, at the Board hearing the Appellant and her representative did not contest any issues with the rating or effective date or otherwise disagree when it was noted that although the appeal initially included service connection for hearing loss, that issue had been granted. 

As the service connection for bilateral hearing loss has already been granted in full, and the neither the Veteran nor the appellant have expressed any disagreement with the assigned ratings or the effective date, there remains no claims over which the Board may exercise jurisdiction. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for PTSD, prostate cancer, and a heart condition, to include ischemic heart disease is remanded.

In remanding this matter, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions. Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.

The issues of entitlement to service connection for a heart condition, a psychiatric condition to include PTSD, and prostate cancer are remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the April 2023 rating decision on appeal. 

VA has a duty to assist claimants to obtain evidence needed to substantiate a claim, which includes making reasonable efforts to obtain private medical records and requesting the claimant provide a release for the records, when the existence of such records has been made known to VA. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c)(1), 3.159(e)(2); see Ivey v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 320, 323(1992) (holding that evidence of record before VA may "raise enough notice of pertinent private medical record to trigger the duty to assist"). Here, prior to the decision on appeal, the AOJ did not obtain relevant private treatment records identified by the record. Specifically, treatment records from Dr. D.C.R. show that the Veteran saw Dr. M.G., a psychologist, in May 2020. See October 2020 treatment records from Dr. D.C.R. However, the record does not contain any private treatment records from Dr. M.G. in or around 2020, nor is there evidence that the VA made efforts to obtain these records. Here, the missing private treatment records are relevant because they pertain to the Veteran's treatment of a psychiatric disability, in which the identified private treatment records may contain pertinent information regarding the Veteran's medical history, condition, treatment, and psychiatric diagnoses. Therefore, a remand is necessary to afford the appellant the opportunity to provide, or authorize release to VA, of these relevant records.

The Veteran asserted that his prostate cancer and heart condition, including ischemic heart disease were related to contaminated water at Camp LeJeune in North Carolina and that his PTSD manifested in service.  See December 2022 VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim.  However, no Individual Exposure Record (ILER) is of record. The clinician providing the VA heart and male reproductive organ conditions examinations and opinions noted that no ILER was of record when providing reasoning for her negative opinions. Without such record, potentially relevant facts on which to establish exposure, and thus find a direct nexus, may be missing from the claims file. Once undertaken, an opinion must be adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). Thus, a remand is necessary for the AOJ to obtain an ILER and an updated TERA memorandum along with an adequate VA opinion to correct duty to assist errors on the part of the AOJ in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Additionally, during the hearing, the appellant's representative argued that the Veteran's service personnel records also showed that he had served aboard several naval vessels, which possible toxic exposure was a known common place on naval vessels.  See August 2024 hearing transcript.  A review of the Veteran's service personnel records show that he served aboard the USS Botetourt from April 12, 1951, to May 2, 1951, the USS Fremont from September 16, 1951, to October 2, 1951, and the USS Bottineau from November 5, 1951, to November 14, 1951.  Remand is required to satisfy a regulatory or statutory duty by determining whether any appropriate exposure tracking systems, such as the ILER, indicate such exposure occurred and to obtain an addendum opinion if so. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) (indicating that the Board may remand for correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim).

This development is needed pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act). See 38 U.S.C. § 1168. The PACT Act requires that when a veteran whose active service subjected them to participation in a TERA files a claim to service connect a disability and there is evidence of such disability, VA must provide the veteran with a VA examination and obtain a medical opinion addressing the possibility of a nexus between the claimed disability and the TERA. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a)(1).  Therefore, a remand is necessary to obtain an opinion regarding whether or not the Veteran's claimed heart condition and prostate cancer are related to a TERA while serving on any naval vessels.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Ask the appellant to complete VA Form 21-4142 for Dr. M.G., for treatment records in 2020 for a psychiatric disability. Make two requests for the authorized records from all identified sources unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.  

2. Obtain an individual longitudinal exposure record for the Veteran and complete an updated TERA memorandum to determine if the Veteran was exposed or engaged in a TERA while in service at Camp Lejeune, where he reported that he was exposed to contaminated water.  Also, determine if the Veteran was exposed or engaged in TERA while serving on the naval vessels, including the USS Botetourt from April 12, 1951, to May 2, 1951, the USS Fremont from September 16, 1951, to October 2, 1951, and the USS Bottineau from November 5, 1951, to November 14, 1951. Then associate these records with the Veteran's claims file. 

3. After the above development, obtain a VA addendum medical opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's prostate cancer and a heart condition, including ischemic heart disease. The examiner must review the claims file.

The examiner is asked to provide opinions as to whether the Veteran's prostate cancer and heart condition including ischemic heart disease were at least as likely as not (likelihood was at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to the Veteran's service.  

If the ILER indicates the Veteran was exposed or engaged in a TERA, the addendum opinion should include an opinion as to whether it was at least as likely as not the Veteran's heart prostate cancer and heart condition including ischemic heart disease were related to that exposure.

In addressing the reported exposure(s), the clinician should consider the total potential exposure of the Veteran; and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

A rationale is necessary for each provided opinion.
