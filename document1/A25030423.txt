ORDER

Entitlement to a disability evaluation of 30 percent for bilateral plantar fasciitis with bilateral degenerative arthritis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence demonstrates the Veteran's bilateral foot disability manifests in severe symptoms including marked pronation of the feet, with pain on manipulation and use accentuated, along with swelling on use.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a disability evaluation of 30 percent for bilateral plantar fasciitis with bilateral degenerative arthritis have been met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1155, 5107;?38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.321, 4.1, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5276. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1985 to August 1989.

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the August 2021 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

In the June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300,?20.301, 20.801.  Here, the Board acknowledges the Veteran noted she wished to appeal the July 2021 rating decision, but the Board interprets the VA Form 10182 in the light most favorable for the Veteran, thus, the Board will consider the period on review to extend until the March 2022 decision. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to a disability evaluation of 30 percent for bilateral plantar fasciitis with bilateral degenerative arthritis

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based, as far as can practically be determined, on the average impairment of earning capacity.?38?U.S.C. §?1155;?38?C.F.R. §?4.1. Each service-connected disability is rated on the basis of specific criteria identified by Diagnostic Codes.?38?C.F.R. §?4.27. When rating the Veteran's service-connected disability, the entire medical history must be borne in mind. Schafrath v. Derwinski,?1?Vet. App.?589?(1991). The Court has held that a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made. Hart v. Mansfield,?21?Vet. App.?505?(2007). Separate compensable evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time if such distinct periods are shown by the competent evidence of record during the appeal, a practice known as "staged" ratings. See Fenderson v. West,?12?Vet. App.?119, 126?(1999).? 

Regulations require that where there is a question as to which of two evaluations is to be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.?38?C.F.R. §?4.7.

The Veteran's plantar fasciitis was rated by analogy throughout the appeal period under DC 5276, for flatfoot.  As of February 7, 2021, plantar fasciitis is now a listed condition in the rating schedule for the feet, under DC 5269.  The Board notes the rating schedule for DC 5276 did not change under the February 7, 2021, amendments.  Generally, a change in rating criteria during the pendency of the claim applies prospectively, if more favorable.

Under the previous rating criteria prior to February 7, 2021, under DC 5276, a noncompensable rating is warranted for mild symptoms relieved by built-up shoe or arch support.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for a moderate disability where the weight-bearing lines are over or medial to the great toes and there is inward bowing of the tendo Achillis and pain on manipulation and use of the feet.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for a severe disability if there is objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use and characteristic callosities.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for pronounced symptoms if there is evidence of marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo achillis on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances.

Descriptive words such as "mild," "moderate," and "severe" are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just."  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  The use of descriptive terminology by medical examiners, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue.  All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines "marked" as "having a distinctive or emphasized character." See https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marked (last visited April 2, 2025).

Effective February 7, 2021, DC 5269 provides rating criteria for plantar fasciitis.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for bilateral or unilateral plantar fasciitis.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for unilateral plantar fasciitis, with no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for bilateral plantar fasciitis, with no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment.  Actual loss of use of the foot should be rated 40 percent.  If the Veteran has been recommended for surgical intervention, but is not a surgical candidate, then plantar fasciitis should be rated under the 20 percent or 30 percent criteria, whichever are applicable.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5269.

The VA examiner with whom the Veteran met in July 2021 confirmed diagnoses of bilateral plantar fasciitis and degenerative arthritis of the bilateral feet, noting symptoms including pain, limited range of motion, multiple weekly flareups lasting several hours each, bilateral pain on use and pain on manipulation, and swelling on use. There was no evidence of characteristic callosities, but the Veteran evinced extreme tenderness of the plantar surfaces bilaterally, albeit improved with orthotics. The Veteran showed decreased longitudinal arch height, and there was evidence of marked deformity (pronation) bilaterally. Moreover, the Veteran had marked inward displacement of the achilles on manipulation. The examiner noted that the Veteran had undergone non-surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis which had been helpful. There was no evidence of metatarsalgia or Morton's neuroma, and no hallux valgus. 

A March 2021 examiner noted the Veteran complained of extreme tenderness at the soles of both feet.  The examiner stated that her treatment has not completely relieved her symptomology. 

The Board observes that the findings noted on VA examination are consistent with those found in VA treatment records, which document a long history of plantar fasciitis, which treating providers have characterized consistently as a barrier to mobility and activity. Nowhere in the record, however, do treating providers indicate a degree of disability beyond what is shown in the July 2021 VA examination report.

A review of the evidence summarized above convinces the Board that entitlement to a 30 degree evaluation under DC 5276 is warranted, based on evidence of severe symptoms and evidence of marked deformity in the form of pronation, with pain on manipulation and swelling on use of the bilateral feet. 

A 50 percent evaluation is not warranted as the evidence confirms the Veteran's condition has been improved by treatment, and there is no objective evidence of severe spasm of the tendo achillis on manipulation.  Although there is evidence of extreme tenderness of both feet, the Veteran reported that was improved by the use of orthotics.  As such, the persuasive weight of the evidence most nearly approximates the 30 percent rating. 

The Board has also considered whether a rating under DC 5269 would be more favorable to the Veteran.  However, a 30 percent rating is assigned where there is no relief from both non-surgical and surgical intervention.  A 40 percent rating is only contemplated with loss of the foot.  Therefore, the Board concludes that DC 5276 provides the most favorable rating for the Veteran. 

 

Accordingly, in sum, the Board finds warranted entitlement to an increased evaluation for 30 percent for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral foot condition, and to that extent, the appeal will be granted.
