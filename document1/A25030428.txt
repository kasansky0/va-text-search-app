ORDER

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 60 percent for hypertensive heart disease is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for hypertensive vascular disease is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the entire period on appeal, the weight of the competent and probative evidence shows that the Veteran's hypertensive heart disease did not manifest in workload of 3.0 METs or less resulting in heart failure symptoms.

2. For the entire period on appeal, the weight of the competent and probative evidence shows that the, the Veteran's hypertensive vascular disease has not manifested in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and requires medication, at any point during the appeal period. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an evaluation in excess of 60 percent for hypertensive heart disease have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, DC 7007.

2. The criteria for a compensable rating for hypertensive vascular disease have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, DC 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1994 to August 2001.

In April 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD) and elected the Direct review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the April 2024 NOD asserted that the Veteran's combined disability rating was incorrect. However, the Appellate Brief submitted by the Veteran's representative indicates that the Veteran is seeking review of the October 2023 AOJ decision. Accordingly, the Board provides the following clarification regarding calculating combined disability ratings and has adjudicated the increased ratings claims below. 

VA is directed by law to provide evaluations based on the combination of ratings for multiple service-connected disabilities by use of the Combined Ratings Table at 38 C.F.R. § 4.25 and cannot consider any disability that is not recognized as service-connected. The Board is bound by applicable statutes, regulations of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and precedent opinions of the General Counsel of the Department of Veterans Affairs and is without authority to revise them. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c). 

VA regulation provides that disability ratings for multiple service-connected disabilities are not merely added together; rather, they are combined using the Combined Ratings Table. 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. The Combined Ratings Table results from the consideration of the efficiency of the individual as affected first by the most disabling condition, then by the less disabling condition, then by other less disabling decisions. Id.

To apply the Combined Ratings Table, disabilities are first arranged in the exact order of the severity, beginning with the greatest disability, and then combined in accordance with the Combined Ratings Table. For example, if there are two disabilities, the degree of one disability will be read in the left column and the degree of the other in the top row, whichever is appropriate. The figures appearing in the space where the column and row intersect will represent the combined value of the two. This combined value will then be converted to the nearest number divisible by 10, and combined values ending in 5 will be adjusted upward. 38 C.F.R. §4.25(a). Accordingly, the Veteran's current 70 percent combined disability rating is correct when arranging his service-connected disabilities according to severity from greatest to least (60 percent for hypertensive heart disease; 10 percent residual, status post tumor removal, left knee; and 10 percent tinnitus (the remaining service-connected disabilities are currently assigned noncompensable ratings)) and utilizing the Combined Ratings Table. 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.

INCREASED RATINGS

Laws and Regulations

The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant. Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value. When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claims or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a the most persuasive evidence is against the claims, in which case, the claims are denied. See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). 

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. The percentage ratings represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 (2012). Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7 (2021). Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3. 

In this case, the Veteran is competent to testify on factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge. Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005). He is also competent to report symptoms of his hypertensive heart disease and hypertensive vascular disease disabilities. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994). The Veteran is competent to describe his symptoms and their effects on employment or daily activities.  

The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making a disability determination.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 (2021). Where service connection has already been established, and increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of the disability that is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous." Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time. Fenderson, supra at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings). When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the relevant time period for consideration is the time period one year before the claim was filed. Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509.

1. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 60 percent for hypertensive heart disease

The Veteran and his representative contend that he is entitled to a disability rating in excess of 60 percent for his hypertensive heart disease. See August 2024 Appellate Brief (IHP); see also April 2024 VA Form 10182.

The October 2023 AOJ decision increased the evaluation from 30 percent to 60 percent for this heart condition based on the October 2023 VA examination documenting a workload of 3.0 to 5.0 METs. See October 2023 C&P Exam: Heart Conditions. Accordingly, the Veteran's service-connected hypertensive heart disease is currently rated at 60 percent, effective July 13, 2023, under DC 7007.  

Under Diagnostic Code 7007, which uses the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart, a 30 percent rating contemplates a workload of 5.1 to 7.0 METs resulting in heart failure symptoms; or there is evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilation confirmed by an echocardiogram or the equivalent (e.g., multi-gated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging). A 60 percent rating contemplates where a workload of 3.1 to 5.0 METs result in heart failure symptoms. A 100 percent rating contemplates where a workload of 3.0 METs or less result in heart failure symptoms.

One MET (metabolic equivalent) is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. When the level of METs at which breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, a medical examiner may estimate the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in those symptoms. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2). Heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope. Id., at Note (3).

Turning to the competent and relevant medical evidence, in October 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for heart conditions. The VA examiner confirmed a diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease. See October 2023 C&P Exam: Heart Conditions at 2. The Veteran reported symptoms of chest pain, hard to breathe, loss of breath, and high blood pressure headaches. Id. The Veteran requires continuous medication, such as Amlodipine taken twice daily, for control of the disability. Id. 3. The Veteran has had no myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, heart valve or infectious heart conditions, pericardial adhesions, procedures, or hospitalizations. Id. at 3-6. The objective examination showed clear auscultation of the lungs; normal/regular heart rate, blood pressure, heart rhythm and sounds, and peripheral pulses; no jugular-venous distention; and trace peripheral edema of the right and let lower extremities. Id. at 6. The examiner noted that the Veteran had the follow normal test results: ECG (October 2023), chest x-ray (October 2023), and echocardiogram (September 2023). Id. at 7. The examiner noted that exercise testing was not performed as it was not required as part of the Veteran's current treatment plan and the test was not without significant risk. Id. The examiner stated that his interview based METs test showed workload between 3-5 METs resulting in breathlessness and fatigue. Id. at 8. The examiner opined that the limitations in METs were due solely to the heart disability. Id. Additionally, the examiner found that the Veteran's hypertensive heart disease impacted the Veteran's ability to perform occupational tasks as the Veteran experienced significant fatigue and chest pain due to his heart condition. Id. 

After a review of the competent and probative evidence of record, the Board finds the evidence does not reveal that a rating in excess of 60 percent is warranted. In this regard, the evidence reflects workload of greater than 3 METs, but not greater than 5 METs, which results in breathlessness and fatigue. However, the evidence does not reflect workload of 3 METs or less, which results in heart failure symptoms, including breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope. As such, the Board finds a rating in excess of 60 percent for the Veteran's heart disability is not warranted.

In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the assertions of the Veteran and his representative as to the Veteran's symptomatology and the severity of his condition, but to the extent the Veteran believes that he is entitled to a higher rating than assigned herein, concludes that the findings during medical evaluation are more probative than his assertions to that effect.  

Thus, the weight of the competent and probative evidence does not support a finding that an evaluation in excess of 60 percent is warranted at any time during the period of appeal. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim is denied. In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

2. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for hypervascular disease

The Veteran and his representative contend that he is entitled to a compensable disability rating for his hypertensive vascular disease. See August 2024 Appellate Brief (IHP); see also April 2024 VA Form 10182. Additionally, the Veteran's representative contends that the Veteran's symptoms are controlled by medication; therefore, the Board should base its conclusion on the history of the disease prior to the introduction of medication. See August 2024 Appellate Brief (IHP) at 2.

The Veteran's service-connected hypertensive vascular disease is assigned a noncompensable rating, effective August 26, 2001, under DC 7101. 

Diagnostic Code 7101 provides that a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. A 40 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more. A 60 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more. 

In every instance where the rating schedule does not provide for a noncompensable evaluation, a noncompensable evaluation shall be assigned where the requirements for a compensable rating are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria. Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common," "for the most part," or "mainly." See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

The Board notes that the rating criteria for DC 7101 are successive. The rating for each higher disability rating includes the criteria of each lower disability rating. Therefore, if any criterion is not met at a particular level, the Veteran can only be rated at the level that does not require the missing component. Tatum v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 152 (2009); Melson v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 334 (1991).

In other words, for a higher rating, the Veteran's blood pressure readings would have to "mainly" or "for the most part" exhibit the criteria for a higher rating. Isolated blood pressure readings meeting the criteria do not qualify for a higher rating without evidence that the symptoms predominantly meet the relevant criteria. McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 274 (2016) (en banc). While veterans are competent to describe observable symptoms, blood pressure is measured by objective testing. The rating criteria require both documentation of this objective measure of the blood pressure and findings that it falls within a pre-established range to warrant the specified ratings. As such, medical evidence is afforded significant probative value and weight.

Further, the Board notes that the plain language of DC 7101 contemplates the effects of medication. McCarroll, supra. Thus, the Board in this case is permitted to consider the ameliorative effects of medication and base the evaluation of the Veteran's disability on the Veteran's actual blood pressure readings, with the limited exception of an initial 10 percent compensable rating. Id. at 271-72. A 10 percent evaluation is warranted in three circumstances: first, where diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more; second, where systolic pressure is predominantly 160 or more; or third, as a "minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control." Id.

In Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021), the Court held that the plain language of DC 7101 with respect to the 10 percent evaluation criteria-which references "a history of" diastolic pressure over a certain level-required consideration of blood pressure readings prior to when the blood pressure was controlled with medication. Such "history" could necessarily include consideration of blood pressure readings prior to the period on appeal. The Wilson case addressed an appeal of a denial of a compensable evaluation of 10 percent.

At no point did the Court in Wilson call into question its prior holding in McCarroll that DC 7101 expressly contemplated the ameliorative effects of medication, nor did it hold that a Veteran could meet higher disability ratings in excess of 10 percent based on historical pre-medication blood pressure readings years prior to the period on appeal. In contrast to the rating criteria for a 10 percent rating, the successive evaluation criteria in DC 7101 do not mention "a history" of such elevated readings; rather, the successive ratings are based upon actual blood pressure readings.

The Veteran's service-connected hypertensive vascular disease is currently assigned a noncompensable evaluation, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to a compensable evaluation for hypertensive vascular disease. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has been prescribed medication for control of his hypertensive vascular disease. However, the evidence does not show that he has a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more. Moreover, the evidence does not show that his diastolic pressure has been predominantly 100 or more or that his systolic pressure has been predominantly 160 or more during the appeal period.

As an initial matter, the Veteran reported that he has taken medication to control his blood pressure for over 15 years. See October 2023 C&P Exam: Hypertension at 2. However, December 2019 is the earliest documentation in the record of prescribed medication to manage the Veteran's blood pressure. See July 2023 VAMC Other Output/Reports at 30.

Historically, the Veteran had a blood pressure reading of 157/90 (January 1998) and 131/98 (February 1998). See December 2014 STR -Medical at 4, 53, 68. In September 2000, STRs include the following blood pressure readings: 148/98, 149/94, 155/88, 148/91, 140/94, 141/95, 130/79, 129/79. Id. at 68.

During a June 2002 VA examination, the Veteran had the following blood pressure readings: 138/94, 138/96, 138/94. See June 2002 VA Examination at 3. In 2011, the record reflects the following blood pressure readings: 141/109, 150/100, and 149/99. See July 2023 VAMC Other Output/Reports at 29. From October 2019 to December 2019 the Veteran's records reflect the following blood pressure readings: 159/98, 127/93, 150/105, 138/111, 158/98, 159/116, 160/110, 144/96. Id. at 28, 29, 30.

During the period of appeal, in a private treatment record, the Veteran had blood pressure (BP) readings of 136/90 and 132/90 in July 2023. See July 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 10, 13.

Additionally, in a September 2023 transthoracic echocardiogram report, the Veteran's BP reading was 145/120. See October 2023 C&P Exam.

In October 2023 the Veteran underwent a VA examination for his hypertension. The examiner reviewed the claims file and examined the Veteran. See October 2023 C&P Exam: Hypertension at 1. The Veteran's BP readings were 140/80; 130/88, and 148/88. Id. at 2. The Board finds this examination adequate for rating purposes and assigns it high probative weight, noting that it appears to effectively evaluate the Veteran's medical history and blood pressure at the time of the examination. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. At 304 (2008) ("It is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion ... that contributes probative value to a medical opinion.")

Also, during the October 2023, the Veteran noted that he had been taking medication for his hypertension for over 15 years. See October 2023 C&P Exam: Hypertension at 2. The Veteran, through his representative, also argued that the medication's ameliorative effects should not be considered. See August 2024 Appellate Brief (IHP) at 2-3. However, as stated above, DC 7101 does consider the ameliorative effects of medication for hypertension, with the limited exception of awarding a 10 percent rating. McCarroll, 28 Vet. App. at 271-72

Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more. Furthermore, while the Veteran has required continuous medication to control his blood pressure, the persuasive evidence is against finding that the Veteran had a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more prior to when the blood pressure was controlled with medication. Although, the record does show some readings with diastolic pressure of 100 or more, the disability picture does not demonstrate a prevailing history where the "most frequent or common" diastolic pressure was 100 or above. The evidence overall indicated that the Veteran's blood pressure was stable and well controlled with medication throughout the appeal period.

In sum, the criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 7101 are not met; thus, a noncompensable rating is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31. Accordingly, the claim is denied.

In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the assertions of the Veteran and his representative as to the Veteran's symptomatology and the severity of his condition, but to the extent the Veteran believes that he is entitled to a higher rating than assigned herein, concludes that the findings during medical evaluation are more probative than his assertions to that effect.  

Thus, the weight of the competent and probative evidence does not support entitlement to a compensable evaluation for hypertensive vascular disease at any time during the period of appeal. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim is denied. In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Ortiz, supra; Gilbert, supra.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
