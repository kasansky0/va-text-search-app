ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine as proximately due to service connected left ankle pain and right knee pain is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine is proximately due to changes in gait resulting from his service connected left ankle and right knee disabilities. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine as proximately due to service connected left ankle pain and right knee pain have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability most recently addressed in an April 2022 rating decision.  In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal [and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window].  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine is granted. 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Entitlement to service connection may be established on a secondary basis where there is evidence of (1) a current, non-service-connected disability, (2) a current service-connected disability, and (3) evidence that the non-service-connected disability is either (i) proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability or (ii) aggravated (increased in severity) beyond its natural progression by a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 446 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The August 2023 rating decision on appeal reflects the favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine. Service connection is in effect for left ankle pain and right knee pain. 

In March 2023 VA received an opinion from a non-VA medical provider who opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's lumbar spondylolisthesis was proximately due to biomechanical changes resulting from an antalgic gait pattern attributable to pain associated with the Veteran's service connected left ankle and right knee disabilities. 

The AOJ has not obtained any medical opinion addressing whether the Veteran's lumbar spondylolisthesis is proximately due to or aggravated by any other service connected disability. The Board further notes that in an August 2023 opinion a VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability was directly attributable to his period of active service and, in support of this conclusion, cited to the March 2023 non-VA opinion relating the lumbar spine disability to the service connected left ankle and right knee disabilities. 

In evaluating a claim for disability benefits, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

The Board finds that the evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's lumbar spondylolisthesis is proximately due to his service connected left ankle pain and right knee pain. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine as proximately due to service connected left ankle pain and right knee pain are met, and the same is hereby granted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.
