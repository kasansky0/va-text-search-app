DOCKET NO. 240227-419802
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal in this docket is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

The February 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) lists claims that were either not addressed in the underlying January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision on appeal or are otherwise being addressed in a different appeal stream. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the Veteran's appeal in this docket stream have been met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105 (d). Here, the Veteran filed a February 2024 Notice of Disagreement in which he appealed the AOJ's January 2024 denial of service connection for a neck condition. The Veteran also attempted to appeal claims for service connection for back and "cervical spine" conditions. In this regard, he listed a February 24, 2024 rating decision. Notably, the "cervical spine" pertains to the neck region of the spine. Therefore, the Board interprets this to mean that the Veteran was appealing denial of service connection for a neck condition. Finally, the Veteran listed a February 2024 higher level review rating decision in which the AOJ identified a duty to assist error with respect to his neck condition claim.

Preliminarily, the Board notes that the record does not contain a February 24, 2024 rating decision or any rating decision pertaining to the Veteran's back within the one year preceding his February 2024 Notice of Disagreement. In fact, the record shows that the Veteran's claim for service connection for a back condition was denied in a May 2011 rating decision that became final. The Board cannot adjudicate a claim listed in a Notice of Disagreement that was not addressed in the underlying rating decision on appeal.  

With respect to the Veteran's claim for service connection for a neck condition, the claim was denied in a January 2024 rating decision, the Veteran then requested higher level review on February 21, 2024.  The AOJ issued a February 26, 2024 higher level review decision  in which it identified a duty to assist error. As a result, the AOJ determined that further development was necessary.  Consequently, the February 2024 higher level review rating decision is not a final decision subject to appellate review.  Put simply, this was not a final decision that could be appealed to the Board.  Rather, the Veteran needed to wait for the rating decision to issue following the development ordered by the HLR reviewer to appeal the claim to the Board.  It is noted that this decision was issued in March 2024 and the Veteran filed a timely appeal.

Thus, the Veteran's claim for service connection for a cervical spine disability is being addressed in a different appeal stream.  However, this appeal stream was improperly docketed. The law precludes a Veteran from pursuing a claim in two appellate lanes.  That is, he cannot file both a request for HLR and a notice of disagreement to the Board at the same time.  Whichever is received first (in this case the request for HLR) is controlling, and renders the other document without legal merit. 

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the claim for service connection for a cervical spine disability in this docket, and it is dismissed.  It is noted however, that the claim will be addressed in Docket Examiner 240403-431007.
