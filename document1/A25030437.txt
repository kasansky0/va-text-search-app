ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for residuals, right patella fracture, with degenerative change and instability is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The December 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) concerning the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for residuals, right patella fracture, with degenerative change and instability results from an impermissible concurrent election and was docketed by the Board in error.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for residuals, right patella fracture, with degenerative change and instability is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1962 to April 1974.

This appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

The appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in December 2024. He elected the Direct Review. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's issuance of the March 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Increased Rating

As a general matter, within one year of the date the AOJ issues a decision under AMA, which went into effect on February 19, 2019, a claimant may elect one of three review options, or lanes: (i) Higher-Level Review by the AOJ; (ii) Supplemental Claim; or (iii) appeal to the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a) (1). If a request for review under one of these three lanes is pending final adjudication, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different lane without first withdrawing the pending review request. 38 U.S.C. § 5104 (a) (2) (A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b), 20.205.

After a claimant elects one of the three available review options, the claimant may not take another action with respect to the same claim until the Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board is adjudicated; or the elected Request for Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board is withdrawn. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c).

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim in November 2023 claiming an increased rating for his service-connected residuals, right patella fracture. In March 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision denying the Veteran's claim for increased rating. In June 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review. A duty to assist error was found in a September 2024 rating decision by the AOJ. A rating decision was issued in December 2024 proposing a reduction for the Veteran's osteoarthritis, status post right patella fracture from 40 percent to 20 percent and proposing a separate evaluation of 10 percent for instability, status right patella fracture.

While the Higher-Level Review request was awaiting further adjudication regarding the proposed reduction, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement in December 2024. He did not withdraw the Higher-Level Review request at any time within one year of the date the AOJ issued the March 2024 rating decision. 

In Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) determined that concurrent elections are prohibited. More specifically, the Court held that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option." The Court's holding was expressly predicated on finding that multiple administrative review requests were "not pending concurrently" as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a) (2) (A). Id. In other words, the Court's holding in Terry makes it perfectly clear that only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues.

Here, the Veteran filed the December 2024 VA Form 10182 requesting Board review of the March 2024 rating decision while the June 2024 Request for Higher-Level Review was still pending. Because the AOJ had not yet issued a decision of its Higher-Level Review, as the proposed reduction was still pending, and the Veteran did not withdraw the June 2024 request, the Board should not have accepted the December 2024 VA Form 10182 because it was concurrent with the VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review of the March 2024 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b); see Terry, supra.

As such, the Board should not have docketed the December 2024 VA Form 10182 as it resulted from an impermissible concurrent election of review for the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for residuals, right patella fracture, with degenerative change and instability in the June 2024 Request for Higher-Level Review. The Board may dismiss an appeal for a procedural defect, such as improper docketing of an appeal. See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021). Due to this procedural defect, the appeal is dismissed. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500 (b); Terry, supra.
