FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's left foot disability, bilateral elbow disorders, right knee condition, neck disability, bilateral hip disorders, and right shoulder disability, are not shown to have had onset in service, arthritis was not shown within one year of service discharge, nor was any of the claimed disorders shown to be related to any aspect of service. 

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had an eye disability manifested by blurry vision at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2002 to April 2006, and from March 2007 to March 2011.

This appeal comes from a June 13, 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision.? See VA Form 10182 AMA Notices of Disagreement (Direct Review Lane) received June 17, 2024, and June 21, 2024.? Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AMA decision on appeal.? 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. 

The Board notes that prior to the current rating decision on appeal, and after the Veteran's claims on appeal were docketed, VA received additional VA Forms 10182, wherein the Veteran appealed multiple claims, to include the same claims that are currently before the Board, as well as claims that were previously appealed to the Board in a separate Notice of Disagreement.  

Under the AMA, concurrent or duplicate election is prohibited, meaning that once a claimant has filed for review through one option (i.e., higher-level review, supplemental claim, Board review), the Veteran cannot seek review under a different one, or in multiple, while that review is pending final adjudication.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b).  Thus, the claims have been docketed in separate appeals streams (docket numbers 240610-446285 and 250228-521951) and will be the subject of separate Board decisions.  

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.??38?U.S.C. § 1131;?38?C.F.R. §?3.303.? Service connection means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service, or if preexisting service, was aggravated therein.??38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38?C.F.R §?3.303(d).??????? 

To establish service connection for a disability, there must be competent evidence of the following: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or "nexus" between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.? Horn v.? Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?231, 236 (2010);?Shedden?v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004);?Gutierrez v.?Principi, 19?Vet. App.?1, 5 (2004) (citing Hickson v.?West, 12?Vet. App.?247, 253 (1999)).? In many cases, medical evidence is required to meet the requirement that the evidence be "competent."? However, when a disability may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination "medical in nature" and is capable of lay observation.? Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 309 (2007).??????? 

Service connection for certain chronic diseases?may be presumed to have been incurred in service by showing that the disease manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1101, 1112;?38?C.F.R. §§?3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).? Such a chronic disease is presumed under the law to have had its onset in service even though there is no evidence of that disease during the period of service.??38?C.F.R. §§?3.307(a). 

When a chronic disease is shown in service, sufficient to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.??38?C.F.R. §?3.303 (b).? To be "shown in service," the disease identity must be established, and the diagnosis must not be subject to legitimate question.??Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2013);?see also 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(b).? There is no "nexus" requirement for compensation for a chronic disease which was shown in service, so long as there is an absence of intercurrent causes to explain post-service manifestations of the chronic disease.? Walker, 708 F.3d at 1336.??????? 

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under the laws administered by VA.? VA shall consider all information and medical and lay evidence of record.? Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.? 38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).???? 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left foot disability, bilateral elbow disorders, right knee condition, a neck disability, bilateral hip disorders,               and a right shoulder disability.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a left foot disability, bilateral elbow disorders, right knee condition, a neck disability, bilateral hip disorders, and a right shoulder disability.  He attributed the claimed disabilities to general wear and tear during the performance of his duties as a motor vehicle transport operator, to include loading and unloading ammunition and artillery rounds on to vehicles, marching, jumping off large vehicles, and heavy lifting of general equipment, ammunition, weapons and vehicle parts. 

The evidence shows that the Veteran has been diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the left foot and right shoulder strain.  Concerning the claimed bilateral elbow disorders, right knee condition, a neck disability and bilateral hip disorders, the evidence of record fails to show a diagnosis for these disabilities.  

The discussion below will assume (but not concede) for purposes of argument that the Veteran has been diagnosed with bilateral elbow disorders, right knee condition, a neck disability and bilateral hip disorders.

The service treatment records show that in a report of medical history in October 2010, the Veteran reported a history of painful knees and bilateral shoulder pain with popping, as well as his toes going numb.  The remainder of the Veteran's service treatment records, which are extensive and reflect treatment for multiple disabilities over the years, failed to document any left foot disability, elbow disorder, right knee condition, neck disability, hip disorder, or right shoulder disability complaints, problems, treatment, trauma or injuries.   

While the service treatment records noted a complaint of shoulder pain and toe numbness, the symptoms appears to have been acute and transitory and to have resolved with time.?? 

Simply stated, the fact that he may have experienced right shoulder "pain" and toe "numbness", or any problems with his neck, right knee, hips or elbows, in service more than 14 years ago, does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that his current problems, years later, are related to any symptoms during service many years ago.? 

Additionally, arthritis was not shown in service or within one year following discharge from active duty service, as such, service connection cannot be established for arthritis on a presumptive basis.? 38?U.S.C. §?1112; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.307, 3.309.???

Based on the above, the Board must conclude both that a chronic hip disability did not have its onset during service and has not been continuous since that time.  Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995).  In so noting, the Board recognizes that the mere absence of medical records is not dispositive as to the question of continuity; the lay evidence must be considered as well.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d at1335.  If, however, it is determined based on reliable evidence, that there was an extended period of time after service without any manifestations of the claimed condition, then that tends to weigh against a finding of a connection between the disability and service.  See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  To the extent the Veteran is asserting continuity of symptomatology from service, the Board finds such statements inconsistent with the overall record, to include the service and post-service treatment records, which fail to document any related complaints until the filing of the current claims for VA benefits.  See Cartwright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (pecuniary interest may affect the credibility of testimony); see also Owens, supra.  Therefore, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran did not have a continued problem with a left foot disability, a neck disability, bilateral elbow disorders, right knee condition, bilateral hip disorders, or a right shoulder disability, in and since service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).

It is important for the Veteran to understand that the service and post-service record provides significant evidence against the claims.

Even assuming, without conceding, for discussion purposes that the credibility of the Veteran's account of in-service symptoms, the record is insufficient to link any current foot, elbow, knee, neck, hip or shoulder problems to any injuries in service, or to any other aspect of service.  Simply stated, the fact that he may have experienced hip pain and numbness in service, does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that his current problems years later are related to those complaints.  The existence of some of the problems, years after service, is still in question in this case, let alone a chronic problem that can be reasonably associated with military service years ago. 

The Board has considered the statements from the Veteran asserting that a left foot disability, bilateral elbow disorders, right knee condition, a neck disability, bilateral hip disorders, and a right shoulder disability, are due to service.  The Veteran is certainly competent to report as to the observable symptoms he experiences and their history, but he cannot diagnose because of the medically complex nature of such a diagnosis.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006); See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting general competence to testify as to symptoms but not to provide medical diagnosis).  The ultimate questions in this case are related to an internal medical process which extends beyond an immediately observable cause and effect relationship. Id.  Moreover, whether the symptoms the Veteran experienced in service or following service are in any way related to service is a matter that requires medical expertise to determine.  See Clyburn v. West, 12 Vet. App. 296, 301 (1999) ("Although the Veteran is competent to testify to the pain he has experienced since his tour in the Persian Gulf, he is not competent to testify to the fact that what he experienced in service and since service is the same condition he is currently diagnosed with.").

Simply stated, both the best medical evidence in this case, and the facts of this case, provide highly probative evidence against the claims, indicating a left foot disability, bilateral elbow disorders, right knee condition, a neck disability, bilateral hip disorders, and a right shoulder disability, that began many years after service with no connection to service.??? 

A VA examination or medical opinion regarding the etiology of his claimed left foot disability, bilateral elbow disorders, right knee condition, neck disability, bilateral hip disorders, and right shoulder disability, was not indicated in this case as there is no suggestion that the Veteran's claimed disabilities may be associated with service, and they did not manifest in service or within one year following discharge from service.  Moreover, there is no competent and probative evidence to show that the Veteran had a left foot disability, bilateral elbow disorders, right knee condition, a neck disability, bilateral hip disorders, or a right shoulder disability, during or contemporaneous with service and no competent and probative evidence that his current disorders are related to his service.  See McClendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). 

Nonetheless, the AOJ obtained a VA examination to address the Veteran's claims for service connection for the right shoulder and left foot disabilities to fully address these issues. 

The Veteran underwent VA foot and shoulder examinations in March 2024.  Concerning the foot, the Veteran reported onset of left foot pain in 2006 due to constantly lifting and carrying heavy equipment and jumping four to five feet off the back of trucks while carrying 60 plus pounds of equipment, wearing his uniform, body armor and weapons.  

Regarding the right shoulder, the Veteran reported onset of pain and popping in the right shoulder in 2004, associated with loading and unloading heavy ammunition onto a truck.  Following a review of the evidence and an examination of the Veteran, the examiner diagnosed right shoulder strain and left foot osteoarthritis and opined that the conditions were less likely than not incurred in or caused by service, to include any injuries therein, because the service treatment records failed to document any complaints, evaluation or treatment for right shoulder strain or left foot arthritis or trauma.  

The Board finds the opinion of the VA examiner to be highly persuasive and probative in finding that the evidence does not support a conclusion that the Veteran incurred the current right shoulder and/or left foot disability in service.?  The examiner's findings were based on a review of the evidence, including the service and post service treatment records, an interview of the Veteran and examination, which did not substantiate a finding that the Veteran incurred a chronic right shoulder condition and left foot disability during active duty service.???? 

The examiner considered the complete record and the Veteran's contentions and provided an explanation as to why the evidence does not support a finding that his right shoulder and/or left foot disability was due to service, to include trauma incurred therein.? Finally, the VA examiner's opinion was internally consistent and consistent with other evidence of record and are of significant probative value.? Accordingly, the VA examiner's opinion is entitled to great probative weight.? See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295, 303-304 (2008).? 

Significantly, there is no competent medical evidence that supports the claims.

In summary, there is no competent evidence of arthritis of either hip, elbow, foot, knee, neck, shoulder, foot, or any other disorder in service or within one year following discharge from service.  Thus, the provisions regarding continuity of symptomatology are not applicable.  See Walker, 708 F.3d at 1340 (holding that only conditions listed as chronic diseases in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a) may be considered for service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).  Moreover, the most probative and persuasive evidence is against a finding that the claimed left foot disability, bilateral elbow disorders, right knee condition, neck disability, bilateral hip disorders, and right shoulder disability, are related to service.

In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.? However, the most persuasive evidence weighs against the Veteran's claims.? As such, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and the claims must be denied.? See 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); See?Lynch, 30?Vet. App.?298.??

2. Entitlement to service connection for an eye disability.

The Veteran contends that he developed an eye disability manifested by blurry vision due to the performance of his duties in service without the benefit of using protective goggles.  Again, the Veteran is not citing to an injury.

The Veteran's service treatment records document no vision or eye problems, other than refractive error.  The Veteran reported wearing glasses since high school.  

With respect to the refractive error, congenital or developmental defects, refractive errors of the eye, as such are not diseases or injuries within the meaning of applicable legislation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (c); see also Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (upholding VA's regulation that a congenital disorder is not a disease or injury as contemplated by 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131).  Service connection may be granted for congenital diseases, as opposed to congenital defects.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (c); VAOPGCPREC 67-90, VAOPGCPREC 82-90.  VA regulations specifically prohibit service connection for congenital defects unless such defect was subjected to a superimposed disease or injury during service which created additional disability.  See VAOPGCPREC 82-90.  If a defect is subject to superimposed disease or injury, service connection may be warranted for the resultant disability. Id.

The medical records do not show any disease or injury superimposed on the Veteran's refractive error during active duty service, which created an additional disability.  Thus, service connection for refractive error is not warranted.

In any event, private treatment records in August 2022 and February 2024, show that the Veteran had 20/20 vision in each eye and he did not require glasses.  Therefore, it appears that the Veteran's visual acuity has been corrected to 20/20 bilaterally.

The post-service treatment records do not reflect a diagnosis or treatment for an eye disability manifested by blurry vision. 

Review of the evidentiary record shows that there is no competent or probative evidence showing that the Veteran had an eye disability manifested by blurry vision after service during the period on appeal before the Board.? See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3?Vet. App.?223, 225 (1992) ("Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability," and held that "[i]n the absence of proof of a present disability[,] there can be no valid claim."); see also Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997) (38?U.S.C. §§?1131 requires existence of present disability for VA compensation purposes).??? 

In the absence of proof of present disability, there can be no valid claim.? Here, the evidentiary record shows that there is no competent or probative evidence showing that the Veteran had an eye disability manifested by blurry vision.? Under VA law, the cornerstone of a valid claim for service connection is that there must be competent and credible evidence of the present existence of the disability being claimed.? Moore v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?211, 215?(2007), citing Francisco v. Brown,?7?Vet. App.?55, 58?(1994) ("Compensation for service-connected injury is limited to those claims which show a present disability."); Hicks v. West,?12?Vet. App.?86, 89 (1998); Rabideau v. Derwinski,?2?Vet. App.?141, 144?(1992).? See also Brammer v. Derwinski,?3?Vet. App.?223, 225?(1992) ("Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability.:).? See, too, Gilpin v. Brown,?155 F.3d 1353?(Fed. Cir. 1998).? A current disability means a disability shown by competent and credible evidence to exist.  Chelte v. Brown,?10?Vet. App.?268?(1997); Degmetich v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?208 (1995);?104 F.3d 1328?(1997) (indicating VA compensation only may be awarded to an applicant who has disability existing on the date of application, not for past disability); but see also McClain v. Nicholson,?21?Vet. App. 319?(2007) (further clarifying that this requirement of current disability is satisfied when the claimant has the disability at the time the claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of the claim and that a claimant may be granted service connection even though the disability resolves prior to VA's adjudication of the claim).? See also Romanowsky v. Shinseki,?26?Vet. App.?289 (2013) (considering the application of McClain on a recent diagnosis even predating the filing of a claim).?? 

To the extent the Veteran believes that his claimed eye disability is related to service, as a lay person, he has not been shown to possess the specialized training sufficient to render such an opinion.? Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4.? The diagnosis and/or etiology of an eye disorder requires medical testing and expertise to determine.? Thus, the lay assertions regarding the diagnosis and etiology of the claimed eye disability are of little probative value.???? 

No medical professional has suggested that the Veteran suffers from an eye disability manifested by blurry vision that was incurred in or aggravated by a period of qualifying service, and the Veteran has not presented, identified, or even alluded to the existence of any such medical evidence or opinion.? See?38?C.F.R. §?3.159?(c)(4)(i); cf. Duenas v. Principi, 18?Vet. App.?512, 517?(2004), citing Paralyzed?Veterans of Am. v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs,?345 F.3d 1334, 1355-57?(Fed. Cir. 2003) (noting that a medical examination?conducted in connection with claim development could not aid in substantiating a claim when the record does not already contain evidence of an in-service event, injury, or disease).? The Veteran's general contention that he has an eye disability manifested by blurry vision that was the result of service is a conclusory generalized statement which is insufficient to trigger VA's duty to provide an?examination.  Waters, 601 F.3d at 1278-79.? Absent any indication of an eye disability, much less one that may be associated with service, a medical?examination?is not necessary.??? 

The Board also finds that the facts of this appeal are distinguishable from those in Saunders v. Wilkie,?886 F.3d 1356?(Fed. Cir. 2018) because the record is negative for showing that his subjective reports of blurred vision resulted in functional impairment that affects earning capacity.? See Owens v. Brown,?7?Vet. App.?429, 433?(1995); also see Wait v. Wilkie,?33?Vet. App.?8, 17?(2020).?? 

The best evidence in this case provides evidence against the existence of an eye disability manifested by blurry vision.? ?? 

In this regard, it is important for the Veteran to understand that the post-service treatment records provide particularly negative evidence against this case.?? 

It is essential for the Veteran to understand that the filing of a claim in which the Board cannot find even the existence of the problem undermines his credibility with the Board regarding all claims, not simply this one.  

As a diagnosis of an eye disability manifested by blurry vision has not been shown at any time during the period on appeal, the Board concludes that the most probative evidence is against the claim, and service connection is denied; the benefit of the doubt rule is not for application.? See 38?U.S.C. §?5107;?38?C.F.R. §?3.102; Lynch, 1?Vet. App.?at 55-56.?? 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran seeks service connection for a headache disorder as due to service.

Under the PACT Act, when a veteran submits a claim for compensation, has evidence of a disability, and has evidence of participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), but such evidence is insufficient to grant service connection, the veteran must be provided with a medical examination and opinion.  38 U.S.C. § 1168. 

The Veteran's personnel records show that he served as a motor vehicle operator and in a November 2024 TERA Memorandum, the AOJ determined that the Veteran participated in a TERA due to exposure to vehicle exhaust fumes, oils, fuel, cleaning solvents.  The rating decision on appeal denied service connection for headaches without the opportunity for a VA examination.  This is pre-decisional duty to assist error.

On remand, the AOJ must provide the Veteran with a VA examination addressing the claimed headache disorder.  In doing so, the AOJ must obtain a direct service connection opinion and a TERA medical opinion.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to address the claimed headache disorder.  The examiner must address the following:

(a) The examiner should diagnose any headache disorder found to be present, to include migraine headaches.

(b) For any headache disorder found on examination, the examiner should opine whether the Veteran's headache disorder is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related directly to his service.

(c) For any headache disorder found on examination, the examiner should opine whether the Veteran's headache disorder is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to his toxic exposure risk activities?

In answering this question, the clinician must consider the following: 1) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and 2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
