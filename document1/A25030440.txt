DOCKET NO. 210318-219690
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided by First Responder EMS, Inc., on November 5, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved the Appellant's claim for payment of the cost of medical care provided to the Veteran on November 5, 2020 (Claim ID 302208420068752000).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care services provided by the Appellant on November 5, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Appellant is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished medical care services to the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 1725(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 17.123.  See generally 38 U.S.C. § 1703(c), (h); 38 C.F.R. § 17.4030.

On March 18, 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Evidence Submission docket to review a February 11, 2021, Explanation of Payment (EOP) issued by a VA Health Care System, which denied payment of the claim for services rendered on November 5, 2020, as no authorization number was submitted with the claim, which is a billing requirement for pre-approved care.  

The Appellant's claim for payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on November 5, 2020, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  An April 9, 2022, EOP indicates that the claim for episode of care on November 5, 2020, was paid in the amount of $349.21.  An April 12, 2022, letter to the Veteran confirms this payment.     

The Board acknowledges that the payment is less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care.  If the amount paid for the November 5, 2020, episode of care is disagreeable to the Appellant, they may file a separate appeal of that decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.

The administrative action approving payment for the November 5, 2020, episode of care at issue in this appeal constitutes a reversal of the prior denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the Appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).
