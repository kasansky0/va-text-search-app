ORDER

Service connection for a right shoulder condition is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the current right shoulder condition began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a right shoulder condition are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1994 to September 2009.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, which was subject to a higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service connection for a right shoulder condition

The Veteran asserts his right shoulder pain is due to working as a metal machinist and helicopter mechanic, crew chief, and door gunner for many years during service.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established with certain chronic diseases, based upon a legal presumption, which occurs by showing that the disorder manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent disabling or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a)(3), 3.309(a). Additionally, service connection may be established under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b), when a symptom or symptoms of a chronic disease are noted in service, or within a year of the date of separation from service, and when chronicity is established through a continuity of symptomatology after service. The continuity of symptomatology provision is an alternative method to establishing service connection for the specific chronic diseases listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a). See Walker v. Shinseki, 718 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service treatment records (STRs) are silent for any complaints, diagnosis, or treatment of a right shoulder condition. In a May 2005 Report of Medical History, the Veteran reported low back and knee pain, but no shoulder pain. He reported that he was currently in good health. 

VA treatment records show the Veteran reported pain in his back, just under the shoulder blade in September 2009, however, there were no complaints about his actual shoulders. He had mild degenerative changes at the shoulders in 2017 and in February 2022, x-rays showed moderate degenerative changes in the right shoulder. In March 2022, the Veteran reported having pain for a couple of months, but did not recall any injury and denied overuse. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2023, at which he was noted to have diagnoses of right shoulder impingement syndrome and osteoarthritis. The Veteran reported that he started having right shoulder pain in 2019, when he started doing heavy lifting and working overhead, which is approximately 10 years after service. He indicated that he now has difficulty lifting, outstretching his hand, and grasping. The VA examiner found that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's right shoulder condition was incurred in or otherwise caused by his active military service. The examiner indicated that the Veteran has functional loss, but a review of the STRs showed no documentation of any right shoulder condition. 

After consideration of the entire record and the relevant law, the Board finds that the Veteran's right shoulder condition is not related to service and service connection is not established.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran has a confirmed diagnosis of this disability, however, the criteria for service connection have not been met. The lack of positive etiological opinion weighs against the claim. In this respect, the Board finds that the VA opinion to be highly probative. The VA opinion was based on a thorough review of the claims file and was consistent with other evidence of record. Accordingly, the VA opinion is entitled to great probative weight. Further, the Veteran, himself, stated that his right shoulder pain began 10 years after service and there is no evidence of shoulder pain in service.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay contentions that he was a machinist, among other duties, in service and he is considered competent to report the observable health effects he experiences. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994). However, the mere presence of right shoulder symptoms does not mean his current right shoulder condition stemmed from his military service, as determining the etiology of a disability is a medically complex question which the Veteran lacks the medical training and expertise to answer. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In this case, the evidence of record does not support an etiological link of his right shoulder condition and service or a continuity of symptomatology.

Overall, the evidence of record persuasively favors the conclusion that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's right shoulder condition is the result of his active service. Therefore, service connection is denied.
