REMANDED

Whether the debt in the amount of $1,680 for overpayment of tuition and fees, $250 for books and supplies, and $678.28 for monthly housing allowance under the Post-9/11 GI Bill was properly created, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Although the Board regrets the additional delay, a remand is necessary to ensure that due process is followed and that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claim so that he is afforded every possible consideration. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159. 

The administrative decision on appeal was issued in October 2020 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. The Board notes that the Veteran listed a December 2020 decision as the administrative decision on appeal on his Notice of Disagreement. However, it seems that the Veteran's disagreement stems from the education overpayment discussed in the October 2020 administrative decision.

In the January 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Whether the debt in the amount of $1,680 for overpayment of tuition and fees, $250 for books and supplies, and $678.28 for monthly housing allowance under the Post-9/11 GI Bill was properly created

The Veteran contends that his education overpayment was not validly created. Specifically, the Veteran acknowledges that although he did withdraw from the Fall 2020 term at Old Dominion University, to be less than full-time, he was simultaneously taking classes at Tidewater Community College (paid for out of pocket), thereby totaling a full-time course schedule. For reasons discussed below, a remand is warranted.

Regarding overpayments of educational assistance under Chapter 33, pertinent regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 21.9695, provides that for individuals who do not complete one or more courses in the certified period of enrollment for which he or she received payment, but who substantiate mitigating circumstances for not completing such course(s), VA will prorate the amount of educational assistance and housing allowance to which he or she is entitled. Additionally, if mitigating circumstances are substantiated, a Veteran will not be charged for lump sum payments for books and supplies. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9695(b)(4)(ii) (C). 

Mitigating circumstances means circumstances beyond the individual's control that prevent him or her from continuously pursuing a program of education. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9505. VA regulation provides examples of mitigating circumstances, which include but are not limited to: (1) an illness or mental illness of the individual; (2) an illness or death in the individual's family; (3) an unavoidable change in the individual's conditions of employment; (4) an unavoidable geographical transfer resulting from the individual's employment; (5) immediate family or financial obligations beyond the control of the individual that require him or her to suspend pursuit of the program of education to obtain employment; (6) discontinuance of the course by the educational institution; (7) unanticipated active duty for training; or (8) unanticipated difficulties in caring for the individual's child or children. See 38 C.F.R. § 21.9505.

The record reflects that the Veteran was originally enrolled for 16 credits for the term starting August 29, 2020. On September 25, 2020, the Veteran reduced his credit hours to 13 credits, and on October 16, 2020, another reduction was made to 10 credits. 

In a lay statement from the Veteran, he stated that he needed the education payments to pay for additional purchases associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and virtual learning. 

In the October 2020 decision on appeal, the AOJ stated that the Veteran had changes in his enrollment for the term beginning August 29, 2020, as well as the term beginning May 18, 2020. However, the October 2020 letter only discusses overpayments from the August 29, 2020, term. Additionally, an internal October 2020 document states that a letter discussing mitigating circumstances was produced. However, no letter appears in the Veteran's claims file, nor does it appear that mitigating circumstances were considered by the AOJ. 

Therefore, a remand is warranted to consider any mitigating circumstances in calculating the Veteran's overpayment and determine whether an overpayment resulted from the May 18, 2020 term. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Adjudicate the issue of whether the debt was validly created. Regarding the overpayment of monthly housing allowance and a books and supplies lump sum, the AOJ should review the Veteran's lay statements regarding application of mitigating circumstance and then make a clear determination as to whether mitigating circumstances were presented for the Veteran's withdrawal.

2. Once a determination of mitigating circumstances is made, the AOJ must then calculate the Veteran's housing allowance overpayment in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 21.9635 (d)(1), (2), paying specific attention to the fact that where, as here, the reduction in the rate of pursuit occurs other than on the first date of the term, VA will reduce the eligible individual's educational assistance effective the end of the month during which the reduction occurred when the circumstances in either paragraphs (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) apply.

3. The AOJ should explain, in detail, how the exact housing allowance, tuition, and books and supplies overpayment amounts were arrived at, to include how it calculated any payments/overpayments for each full month and each partial month. In other words, beginning the month of August 2020 the AOJ should document the housing allowance paid, versus how much the Veteran was actually due, and explain how it arrived at each sum, to include a breakdown of the daily benefit allowed based on the Veteran's rate of pursuit for his program.

4. Finally, the AOJ should explain whether an overpayment was created from the term beginning May 18, 2020, at Old Dominion University as stated in the October 2020 letter. If an overpayment exists, explain in detail for the May 18, 2020, term as the above directives demand for the August 29, 2020, term.
