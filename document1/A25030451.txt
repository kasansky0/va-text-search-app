FINDING OF FACT

There was no claim or appeal for VA benefits pending at the time of the Veteran's death in April 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to basic eligibility for substitution based upon death of a claimant have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5121, 5121A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000, 3.1010.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1967 to July 1969. He died in April 2023. The appellant is his surviving spouse.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from separate June 2024 VA administrative decisions which denied the appellant's substitution claim and denied her claim for survivor's pension benefits. In July 2024, the appellant filed a VA Form 10182 to initiate an appeal to the Board's Hearing Docket. In December 2024, the appellant testified at a Board hearing. Thus, the Board will review the evidence of record at the time the June 2024 decisions were issued, and any evidence received at or within 90 days after the Board hearing. 

While the appellant was also issued a June 2024 rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's cause of death, the Veteran and her representative clarified at the Board hearing that the appellant was limiting her appeal to the denial of substitution and entitlement to survivor's pension.

Entitlement to basic eligibility for substitution

The appellant is seeking to substitute for the Veteran for purposes of processing his claims to their completion.

Legal criteria

The statute governing substitution of parties is set forth at 38 U.S.C. § 5121A. This first subpart of that statute provides:

(1) If a claimant dies while a claim for any benefit under a law administered by the Secretary, or an appeal of a decision with respect to such a claim, is pending, a living person who would be eligible to receive accrued benefits due to the claimant under section 5121(a) of this title may, not later than one year after the date of the death of such claimant, file a request to be substituted as the claimant for the purposes of processing the claim to completion.

The implementing regulation further emphasizes that a claim or appeal must be pending. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010 (g)(1). A claim is considered to be pending if the claimant had filed the claim with an agency of original jurisdiction but dies before the agency of original jurisdiction makes a decision on the case. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010 (g)(1)(i).

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the VA Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under VA law. 38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5101; 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (a). A claim means a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p).

Prior to March 24, 2015, a "claim" was defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998). Any communication indicating intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA was considered an informal claim provided it identified, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a). To determine when a claim was received under the relevant regulations prior to their recent amendment, the Board must review all communications that may be construed as an application or claim. Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992). Any communication or action that demonstrates an intent to apply for an identified benefit may be considered an informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a). Thus, the essential elements of a claim prior to March 24, 2015, are "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009).

Moreover, the Federal Circuit reversed the Court and held in Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2020) that a claim must identify the sickness, disease, or injury for which compensation is sought, with at least at a high level of generality, before VA's duty to assist in the development of the claim is triggered.

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that in order to be considered a valid claim, a claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form. 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (eff. Mar. 24, 2015). This amendment applies to claims or appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015. Id. at 57,686.

A submission of an application form prescribed by the Secretary, whether paper or electronic, must meet the requirements of a complete claim as set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160. A complete claim is required for all types of claims, and will generally be considered filed as of the date it was received by VA for an evaluation or award of benefits under the laws administered by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d).

Upon request made in person or writing by any person applying for benefits under the laws administered by VA, the appropriate application form will be furnished. 38 U.S.C. § 5102; 38 C.F.R. § 3.150 (a).

When a claimant or other individual specified in section 3.155(a) of the regulations indicates a desire to file for benefits under the laws administered by VA by a communication or action that does not meet the standards of a complete claim, this is considered a request for an application form for benefits under § 3.150(a). Upon receipt of such a communication or action, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form or form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a).

The U. S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has explained that a claim for VA disability benefits generally requires an intent to seek benefits expressed in writing that identifies the particular benefits sought and that the mere existence of medical records generally cannot be construed as an informal claim. Criswell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 501, 504 (2006).

Analysis

Turning to the evidence of record, in October 2023, the appellant submitted a VA Form 21P-0847 Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant. As such, there is no dispute that the appellant timely filed her claim for substitution within one year of the Veteran's April 2023 death. The evidence of record also clearly establishes the appellant as the surviving spouse of the Veteran.

The disposition of this case turns on whether the evidence establishes that there was a pending, unadjudicated claim filed by the Veteran prior to his death. The Board finds following a review of the record that there was no such pending claim filed by the Veteran prior to his death.

The appellant testified at her Board hearing that shortly before the Veteran's death he had submitted a claim for VA benefits. A review of the claims folder shows that in April 2023, the Veteran received a VA notice letter informing him that VA received his correspondence indicating he would like to file a claim for benefits. The letter informed the Veteran that VA regulations now required all claims to be submitted on a standardized form. The letter then provided the Veteran with information on how to properly file a VA benefits claim.

While the Veteran's claims folder included VA claims forms intended for filing both disability compensation and pension claims, a review of the record does not show that the Veteran had ever submitted any claim for VA benefits prior to his death. At her Board hearing, the appellant was informed she had 90 days from the date of her Board hearing to submit any evidence indicating that a claim for VA benefits was filed by the Veteran prior to his death. No further evidence was submitted following the December 2024 Board hearing.

The Board finds that there were no claims or appeals for VA benefits pending at the time of the Veteran's death, and therefore, there is no claim for which the appellant can substitute for the claimant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5121A (a).

The Board is sympathetic to the appellant's contentions. However, the legal authority pertaining to substitution upon the death of a claimant is prescribed by Congress and implemented via regulations enacted by VA, and neither the AOJ nor the Board is free to disregard laws and regulations enacted for the administration of VA programs. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (c); 38 C.F.R. § 20.101 (a). In other words, the Board is bound by the governing legal authority, and is without authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis. 

As, on these facts, there is no legal basis to allow the appellant's substitution, the claim for such must be denied as a matter of law. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to a survivor's pension

The appellant is claiming entitlement to a survivor's pension. Remand is needed to correct a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error in obtaining complete income and expense information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) prior to the adjudication of this appeal. The appellant's only reported sources of income and expenses have apparently come from the SSA. In the June 2024 VA decision on appeal, the Veteran's annual income was listed as $18,082, and her expenses were listed as $2,067. However, the decision failed to identify the period of time under consideration in which it derived these figures. The available SSA records in the claims folder do not confirm the income and expense amounts used as the basis for the denial of the appellant's claim. For instance, a Social Security Benefit Statement (Form SSA-1099) for the year 2022 listed income paid to the appellant in the amount of $14,592, and Medicare Part B premiums were deducted in the amount of $2,041.20. Available SSA benefit data records show how much monthly income the appellant has received since December 2017, but these records are incomplete as to the expenses withheld.

Basic entitlement to pension exists if, among other things, the claimant's income is not in excess of the maximum annual pension rates (MAPR) specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.23. 38 U.S.C. § 1541; 38 C.F.R. § 3.3 (a)(3). The MAPR is published in Appendix B of the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual M21-1 and is given the same force and effect as if published in VA regulations. 38 C.F.R. § 3.21. The MAPR is revised every December 1st and is applicable for the following 12-month period. The MAPR shall be reduced by the amount of the countable annual income of the surviving spouse. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1521; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.3, 3.23(b).

In determining annual income, all payments of any kind or from any source (including salary, retirement or annuity payments, or similar income, which has been waived) shall be included during the 12-month annualization period in which received, except for listed exclusions. 38 U.S.C. § 1503 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.271 (a). Income from the Social Security Administration (SSA) is not specifically excluded under 38 C.F.R. § 3.272. Such income is therefore included as countable income.

For purposes of calculating pension benefits, total income may be reduced by amounts equal to amounts paid by a claimant for unreimbursed medical expenses that were "in excess of 5 percent of the applicable maximum annual pension rate or rates... as in effect during the 12-month annualization period in which the medical expenses were paid." 38 C.F.R. § 3.272 (g)(1)(iii).

In order to be excluded from income, these medical expenses must be paid during the time period at issue, regardless of when they were incurred. In addition, they must be out-of-pocket expenses, for which the surviving spouse received no reimbursement, such as through an insurance company. However, the medical insurance premiums themselves, as well as the Medicare deduction, may be applied to reduce countable income.

For the purpose of determining initial entitlement, or resuming payments on an award that was previously discontinued, the monthly rate of pension shall be computed by reducing the applicable maximum pension rate by the countable income on the effective date of entitlement and dividing the remainder by twelve. 38 C.F.R. § 3.273 (a).

In essence, VA subtracts the total amount of countable income in one year, less excluded income, from the MAPR for that year; then, if a positive amount remains, the rest is divided by twelve to determine the monthly death pension benefit. When a change in the MAPR occurs, the Board repeats the calculation with the new MAPR as the starting amount. 38 C.F.R. § 3.273 (b)(1). When a change in income occurs, the MAPR will be reduced by the new annualized income effective on the date that the increased income began. 38 C.F.R. § 3.273 (b)(2).

Due to the incomplete SSA income and expense information present in the appellant's record, and the apparent discrepancies between the figures cited in the June 2024 VA decision and the available evidence of record, the Board is unable to evaluate the merits of this appeal.

Remand is needed to obtain complete information regarding the appellant's SSA benefits and Medicare costs. The Appellant should also be afforded the opportunity to provide verification of payment for any unreimbursed medical expenses.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain updated information regarding all SSA benefits and Medicare costs for the appellant from 2023 to the present.

2. Request that the appellant provide verification of payment in the form of receipts of payment or other proof of purchase for any unreimbursed medical expenses from 2023 to the present.
