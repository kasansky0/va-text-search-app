ORDER

Higher evaluations for posttraumatic stress disorder with major depressive disorder, alcohol and cannabis use disorder (PTSD), rated as 30 percent disabling effective August 9, 2018; as 50 percent effective September 11, 2019, and as 70 percent effective July 30, 2021, are denied.

From August 9, 2018, to May 25, 2021, a 10 percent disability rating but no higher, for seborrheic dermatitis is granted.

A compensable disability rating for seborrheic dermatitis from May 26, 2021, is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  From August 9, 2018, to September 10, 2019, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's PTSD results in no more than occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks.

2.  From September 11, 2019, to July 29, 2021, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's PTSD results in no more than occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

3.  From July 30, 2021, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms does not result in total occupational and social impairment.  

4.  From August 9, 2018, to May 25, 2021, the Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis has been controlled by topical medication and affects an exposed surface area of no more than 5 percent.  

5. From May 26, 2021, the Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis has been controlled by topical medications and affects less than 5 percent of the entire body and exposed body areas and is not treated with any systemic therapies and does not cause disfigurement, scars, or extensive lesions. 

6.  There is no legal or factual basis for an effective date earlier than August 9, 2018, for the awards of service connection for PTSD and dermatitis.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  Prior to September 11, 2019, the criteria for a disability rating higher than 30 percent for PTSD are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1995 to October 2005.

In a June 2021 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for seborrheic dermatitis and assigned a 0 percent disability rating, effective April 15, 2021.  In an August 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD and assigned a 30 percent disability rating, effective August 9, 2018, and a 70 percent disability rating from July 30, 2021.  In September 2021 the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) requesting reconsideration of these decisions.  In a September 2022 rating decision, the AOJ denied earlier effective dates for both disabilities.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) of that decision.  

In a June 2023 rating decision, the AOJ assigned a 50 percent evaluation for PTSD from September 11, 2019 and continued the 30 percent evaluation prior to September 11, 2019 and the 70 percent evaluation from July 30, 2021.  The AOJ also granted an earlier effective date of August 9, 2018 for the grant of service connection for seborrheic dermatitis and continued the 0 percent evaluation.  The Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ.  See VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD).  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Increased Rating

The Veteran is seeking a higher disability rating for her service-connected PTSD and dermatitis.

Disability ratings are determined by comparing a veteran's present symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based upon average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's entire history is considered when assigning disability ratings.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).  A review of the recorded history of a disability is necessary to make an accurate rating.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.41.  The regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings where such current findings are adequate and relevant to the rating issue.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994); Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31 (1999).  The Board will consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

PTSD

The Veteran's PTSD is currently rated as 70 percent disabling under DC 9411, effective July 30, 2021.  Prior to that date, it was rated 50 percent from September 11, 2011, and 30 percent from August 9, 2018.  She contends that her symptomatology is more severe than contemplated under the assigned disability evaluations.  

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 30 percent disability rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events).  38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411. 

A 50 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  Id.

A 70 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  Id.

A 100 percent rating is warranted if there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.  Id. 

When determining the appropriate disability evaluation under the general rating formula, the Board's primary consideration is the Veteran's symptoms, but it must also make findings as to how those symptoms impact the Veteran's occupational and social impairment.  Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112 (2013); Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002).  Because the use of the term "such as" in the rating criteria demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, the Board need not find the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms to award a specific rating.  Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442; Sellers v. Principi, 372 F. 3d 1318, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Nevertheless, as all ratings in the general rating formula are also associated with objectively observable symptomatology and the plain language of the regulation makes it clear that the veteran's impairment must be due to those symptoms, a veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under the general rating formula by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration.  Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d 112.

The classification outlined in the portion of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities that addresses service-connected psychiatric disabilities is based upon the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5).  38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  

from August 9, 2018 to September 10, 2019 

The 30 percent evaluation is based on findings from a December 2018 VA examination.  The Veteran's reported symptoms were anxiety, suspiciousness, and chronic sleep impairment.  She also reported drinking a bottle of wine each night before bed and that she typically works at night because nightmares and anxiety keep her awake.  Socially, she was not currently married but was dating and in a new relationship.  She has a young daughter and enjoys taking care of her and attending school function with her.  She also enjoyed baking, reading, photography, and occasionally attends church and socializes with friends.  She was also employed as a registered nurse and works from home writing appeal letters and is able to adjust her workload so that she can work later in the night and evening when she cannot sleep.

During the evaluation the Veteran was friendly and cooperative with neat grooming and neat and appropriate hygiene.  Speech rate and volume were within normal limits.  Thought processes were goal directed and logical with no evidence of any thought disorder or hallucinations.  The Veteran's mood was anxious, and she became emotionally overwhelmed at one point during the interview.  She denied current suicidal and homicidal ideation, intent, and plan.  There was no visible psychomotor agitation or noticeable psychomotor retardation.  The Veteran's insight was fair to poor, and judgement was questionable.  After reviewing the Veteran's claims file, her self-reported medical history, and current symptoms, the examiner concluded the Veteran's PTSD was manifested by occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning  satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care, and conversation.  She was capable of managing her financial affairs.  

Other relevant evidence prior to September 11, 2019, includes VA outpatient treatment records which show few if any entries pertaining to the Veteran's psychiatric disability.  There are no instances of psychiatric treatment, medication, hospitalizations, or complaints of any symptoms which support a higher rating. 

Applying the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology to the rating criteria noted above, the evidence does not support the assignment of a higher evaluation.  Although she reported difficulties due to anxiety and chronic sleep impairment, these symptoms are specifically enumerated in the schedular criteria for a 30 percent rating and did not keep the Veteran from functioning independently or have significant impact on her activities of daily living.  She did not require inpatient psychiatric treatment or medication, and the evidence suggests that her symptoms in general were under control and that she functioned fairly well.  She was employed full time and capable of managing her own financial affairs, which supports a finding that she did not have reduced reliability as is required for a 50 percent disability rating.  The only VA examination during the relevant timeframe shows the examiner specifically found that the frequency, severity, and duration of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms resulted in, at most occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks which is consistent with the criteria for a 30 percent rating.  See Vazquez-Claudio supra.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that prior to September 11, 2019, the Veteran's impairment due to PTSD is most consistent with a 30 percent rating and that the level of disability contemplated in DC 9411 to support the assignment of a 50 percent or rating or higher is absent.  

September 11, 2019 to July 29, 2021 

The record shows the Veteran first exhibited increased psychiatric symptoms on September 11, 2019 based on findings documented during a VA outpatient psychology consultation.  The Veteran reported less energy, decreased concentration, isolation, and less involvement in pleasant events/hobbies.  A depression screening noted the Veteran felt down, depressed, or hopeless, trouble sleeping, felt tired/little, and had trouble concentrating more than half the days suggestive of moderately severe depression.  The remaining records during this timeframe show she continued to struggle with anxiety, periods of sadness, anhedonia, amotivation, social withdrawal, and using alcohol to help relax and sleep.  She reported nightmares several times a week that disrupt sleep but noted that with the use of medication she is able to obtain adequate sleep but wakes up feeling sluggish.  She denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent, or plan.  Mental status examinations, consistently show the Veteran was appropriately groomed and dressed with good hygiene.  She was fully oriented, with appropriate eye contact and normal speech and related appropriately with his healthcare providers.  The Veteran's mood was described as mildly depressed with congruent and pleasant affect.  Her thought process/content were logical, coherent, and goal-directed and showed no signs of audio/visual hallucinations or delusional thinking.  Insight and judgement were adequate, and her memory was intact.  The Veteran consistently denied suicidal or homicidal ideation and routine assessments show she was at low risk for suicide.  

Applying the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology to the rating criteria noted above, the evidence does not support the assignment of an evaluation greater than 50 percent prior to July 30, 2021.  The lay and medical evidence shows that despite her difficulties due to PTSD, her symptoms did not keep her from functioning independently.  Her thinking and speech were consistently noted as normal and her affect in general was appropriate to mood and she required no inpatient psychiatric treatment.  There is nothing in the record suggesting that the Veteran was unable to perform activities of daily living, required personal monitoring for safety, or that she was incapable of maintaining personal hygiene or managing her own financial affairs.  The Veteran remained employed during this timeframe with no indication of significant decreases in work efficiency and there were no reports of relationship issues with her daughter.  So, while the evidence clearly demonstrates that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms were continuous, they were not equivalent, in frequency, duration or severity, to warrant the next higher evaluation of 70 percent which requires symptoms at a level of disability equivalent to deficiencies in most areas.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that prior to July 30, 2021, the Veteran's impairment due to PTSD is most consistent with a 50 percent rating and that the level of disability contemplated in DC 9411 to support the assignment of a 70 percent or rating or higher is absent.  

since July 30, 2021

The current 70 percent evaluation is based on findings from a July 2021 VA examination.  The Veteran reported little change in her personal history or social functioning since her evaluation in 2018.  She was still a single parent to her young daughter but was currently in a relationship.  She also remained employed reporting no negative impact on her mental health stating that "it's great" because she works in solitude at home and has flexibility to step away when needed.  Reported symptomatology included depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks, chronic sleep impairment, memory impairment, flattened affect, disturbances of motivation/mood, difficulty in establishing/maintaining effective work/social relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting, and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  The Veteran adamantly denied any suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.  During the evaluation, the Veteran was casually dressed and was extremely anxious.  Affect was congruent with tearfulness upon recall of the traumas.  Memory was good and she was fully oriented with good insight and clear and goal directed speech.  After reviewing the Veteran's claims file, her self-reported medical history, and current symptoms, the examiner found that the frequency, severity, and duration of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms resulted in, at most occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. 

When examined by VA in October 2021 a few months later, the Veteran reported depressed mood daily for the past several months, decreased interest in activities, decreased appetite, chronic insomnia, low energy, excessive feelings of guilt, and decreased concentration, excessive alcohol and cannibis use.  The Veteran denied suicidal ideation.  However, her relevant social, family, and occupational history were unchanged.  She continued to describe her relationship with her daughter as "good" and although she had difficulty with physical intimacy she was still involved in a relationship.  The Veteran remained employed full time doing utilization management reviews from home for the past three years and denied any issues.  She reported that she does well in her job because it requires little interaction with others and the schedule is flexible.  During the evaluation, the Veteran was polite, open, cooperative, and dressed appropriately with good hygiene.  She was alert and oriented and affect was appropriate to the content of her speech.  She was tearful at times and her mood appeared depressed.  Thought process was logical and organized with no delusional content or evidence of responding to internal stimuli.  Speech and motor activity were within normal limits and memory, attention, and concentration appeared intact.  The Veteran was capable of managing her financial affairs.  After reviewing the record, the Veteran's self-reported medical history, and current symptoms, the examiner found that the frequency, severity, and duration of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms resulted in, at most occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

Applying the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology to the rating criteria noted above, the Board finds that an evaluation higher than 70 percent is not warranted.  Her impairment cannot be described as "total," and the record does not show the type of cognitive and behavioral impairment reserved for a 100 percent evaluation.  The symptoms required for such an evaluation are neither complained of nor observed by medical health care providers, including gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  Crucially, the presence of certain symptoms is not necessarily determinative.  These symptoms must also cause the occupational and social impairment in the referenced areas.  See Vazquez-Claudio, supra.  

To the extent the evidence indicates occupational impairment attributable to PTSD, the Board does not find that it reflects total occupational impairment, and, in any event, the Veteran did not also experience total social impairment.  Despite interpersonal difficulties due to PTSD the Veteran's relationships with her daughter and significant other remain intact and she continues to maintain full time employment.  Moreover, both VA examiners specifically assessed that the frequency, severity, and duration of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms caused occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, which is consistent with the criteria for no more than a 50 percent rating.  Overall, the symptomatology is not consistent with total social and occupational impairment.  Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's impairment due to PTSD since July 30, 2021 is most consistent with a 70 percent rating.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim and there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

seborrheic dermatitis

The Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis is currently rated as noncompensable under DC 7806 for dermatitis or eczema.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118. 

VA amended the rating criteria for skin conditions, effective August 13, 2018.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 32,597 (July 13, 2018); 83 Fed. Reg. 38,663 (Aug. 7, 2018).  In cases where rating criteria are amended during the course of the appeal, the Board must consider both the former and current schedular criteria.  Should an increased rating be warranted under new, revised criteria, the award may not be made effective before the effective date of change.  See Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327, 1328(Fed. Cir. 2003).  

Effective August 13, 2018, dermatitis is evaluated under the General Rating Formula for the Skin.  A noncompensable rating is warranted where no more than topical therapy is required over a 12-month period and there are characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body or less than 5 percent of exposed areas.  A 10 percent rating is provided for at least one of the following: (i) characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; (ii) at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or (iii) intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.  A 30 percent rating is provided for at least one of the following: (i) characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or (ii) systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.  A 60 percent rating is provided for at least one of the following: (i) characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or (ii) constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

Under the new schedule, "systemic therapy" refers to treatment that is administered through any route (orally, injection, suppository, intranasally) other than the skin and topical therapy refers to treatment that is administered through the skin.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).

Prior to August 2018, DC 7806 provided a noncompensable rating when less than 5 percent of the entire body or less than 5 percent of exposed areas was affected, and no more than topical therapy was required during the past 12-month period.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for involvement of at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected, or; intermittent systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than six weeks during the past 12-month period.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for dermatitis or eczema affecting 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas, or; systemic therapy, such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of six weeks or more, but not constantly, during the past 12-month period.  A 60 percent disability rating is assigned for more than 40 percent of the entire body, or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected, or; constant or near-constant systemic therapy, such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs required, during the past 12-month period.  Alternatively, rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (Diagnostic Code 7800) or scars (Diagnostic Codes 7801, 7802, 7804, or 7805), depending upon the predominant disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  

For claims filed prior to August 13, 2018, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that a systematic therapy is one that that affects the entire body in its treatment of the condition at issue, and that the Board must determine (1) whether a topical treatment affects the body as a whole in treating a veteran's skin condition; and (2) whether the given treatment is "like" a corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive drug."  Burton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 286, 289-93 (2018).

The pertinent evidence in this case consists primarily of clinical findings from VA examinations in 2019, and 2021.  

During VA examination in July 2019, the Veteran reported dermatitis on her back and both arms and seborrheic dermatitis which is always present treated with prescription shampoo and creams.  The skin conditions do not cause scarring or disfigurement and there are no systemic manifestations.  In the past 12 months, the Veteran had used a topical steroid cream and shampoo on a constant or near-constant basis with no other treatments or procedures.  The examiner noted the dermatitis on the back and arms was not present at the time of the examination and no body area was affected.  However, the exposed area (face, neck, and hands) affected by seborrheic dermatitis was at least 5 percent on the scalp region in patches.  The total body area affected was less than 5 percent.  There were no other pertinent physical findings noted and there was no functional impact on the Veteran's ability to work. 

When examined by VA on May 25, 2021, the Veteran reported from fall through spring her skin feels like it is on fire, and she develops a rash on the chest and back and her hands will get red and peel.  Currently her scalp feels like it is on fire.  She had not been treated with medication in the past 12 months for any skin condition and there was no evidence of systemic therapy antihistamines, retinoids, biologics, sympathomimetics, phototherapy, or photochemotherapy.  Examination revealed dermatitis affecting less than 5 percent of exposed areas (face, neck, and hands) and less than 5 percent of total body area.  On examination there are small papules and scaling of the occipital scalp, consistent with seborrheic dermatitis.  There was no related scarring or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck.  

When examined by VA in October 2021, the Veteran reported that while it was "not visible at the moment" she felt a flare-up starting in the back of her scalp.  Current treatment included using lukewarm water, mild cleansers, and moisturizers.  In the past year, she had used topical prescription steroid cream for control of moderate to severe symptoms and dandruff shampoos as needed shampoo, for at least 6 weeks or more, but not constantly.  There was no evidence of systemic therapy antihistamines, retinoids, biologics, sympathomimetics, phototherapy, or photochemotherapy.  Examination revealed there were no skin condition affecting exposed areas (face, neck, and hands) or total body area.  The examiner noted the rash/lesions on the arms and torso were quiescent at the present and there were lesions currently on the scalp, as this was quiescent as well. 

After reviewing the record, the Board finds that the evidence reasonably establishes that the Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis was of sufficient severity to warrant a 10 percent rating at the time she applied for service connection in August 2018.  Although the July 2019 examiner reported only minimal symptomatology in the scalp area, they found it affected an exposed surface area of at least 5 percent which falls just within the criteria for a 10 percent schedular rating under the General Rating Formula For The Skin.  However, because the Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis did not affect 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or exposed areas and was not treated with any systemic therapies, the criteria for a 30 percent rating or higher were not met under either the pre-2018 regulations or the 2018 amendments.

Also beginning May 25, 2021, the Board finds that the 0 percent rating is appropriate and fully contemplates the Veteran's skin condition.  The May 2021 and October of 2021 VA examinations continued to show seborrheic dermatitis involving the occipital scalp area that requires treatment with topical medications.  Beyond that there is no evidence that large portions of the Veteran's anatomy are involved as it affects less than 5 percent of the entire body and exposed areas.  There is also no indication that the skin disorder requires systemic therapy as required for a 10 percent rating.  Accordingly, from May 25, 2021 a compensable disability rating is not warranted for seborrheic dermatitis, under the old or new criteria pertaining to the skin.  

With respect to both timeframes although the Veteran has been prescribed topical creams, shampoos, and scalp solutions, there is no evidence that such treatments amount to systemic therapy.  These medications are applied topically to only the affected area (occipital scalp).  There is no indication that the local application of any topical medication to the affected areas on the scalp is of sufficient scale to affect the body as a whole, and thus, it is not a systemic therapy.  Johnson v. Shulkin, 862 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2017) See also Burton supra.  

After resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the evidence supports a 10 percent rating for seborrheic dermatitis effective August 9, 2018.  However, from May 25, 2021, the evidence is persuasively against a compensable disability rating and there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

Effective Date

It appears the Veteran is also seeking an effective date earlier than August 9, 2018, for the grant of service connection for PTSD and seborrheic dermatitis.  See June 2024 VA Form 10182, NOD.  There is no assertion that a claim was filed prior to August 9, 2018, and neither the Veteran nor her representative has offered a proposed effective date or a basis for an effective date earlier than August 9, 2018.  Similarly, neither has pointed to any other provision in the law that would allow VA to assign an effective date prior to August 9, 2018.

Under 38 U.S.C.  5110(b)(1) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i), the effective date for a grant of direct service connection will be the day following separation from active service if a claim is received within one year after separation from service.  Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  

In an August 2018 letter, VA acknowledged receipt of an intent to file received on August 9, 2018.  The Veteran formally submitted a VA Form 21-526 for psychiatric and skin disorders in October 2018, within one year of receipt of her intent to file.

In a June 2021 rating decision service connection was granted for seborrheic dermatitis effective April 15, 2021.  A June 2023 rating decision later assigned an effective date of August 9, 2018, the date the intent to file a claim was received.  In an August 2021 rating decision, service connection was granted for PTSD, effective August 9, 2018.  A review of the record shows there are no other pending, unadjudicated claims for either disability prior to that date.  In this case, the Board finds the AOJ assigned the earliest possible effective date for the grants of service connection for PTSD and seborrheic dermatitis.  

Absent an earlier unadjudicated claims for PTSD and seborrheic dermatitis prior to the current effective date of August 9, 2018, earlier effective dates are denied.
