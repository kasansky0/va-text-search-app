ORDER

The appeal of the issues of entitlement to service connection for a right ankle injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, vitiligo, a low back condition, bilateral hearing loss and a sleep disorder is untimely; therefore, the claims are denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The rating decision denying service connection for right ankle injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, vitiligo, a low back condition, bilateral hearing loss and a sleep disorder was issued on March 20, 2012.

2. A notice of disagreement with the March 2012 decision was received by the VA on March 29, 2013, which was not within one year of the date of notice of the determination by VA.

3. The Veteran's evidence of mailing is self-serving testimony that does not rebut the presumption of receipt as it does not establish that the mail was properly addressed, stamped and mailed in adequate time to reach the VA in the normal course of post office business.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

A timely notice of disagreement was not submitted to the March 2012 rating decision. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d), 20.110, 20.200, 20.201, 20.300, 20.306.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1985 to August 1992.

This matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2018 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In October 2018, the Veteran elected the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) opt-in and requested for a Board hearing. The requested hearing was conducted in April 2022; a hearing transcript has been associated with the record.  

In September 2022, the Board denied the claim. Subsequently, the Veteran appealed the Board's September 2022 decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). The Court granted an April 2023 Joint Motion for Remand of the parties which agreed to vacate the Board's September 2022 decision to the extent the Veteran's claim was denied and remanded the matter to the Board for further adjudication. 

In September 2023, the Board again denied the claim. The Veteran subsequently appealed the Board's September 2023 decision to the Court. The Court granted an October 2024 Joint Motion for Remand of the parties which agreed to vacate the Board's September 2023 decision to the extent the Veteran's claim was denied and remanded the matter to the Board for further adjudication. 

In January 2025, the Veteran's attorney submitted additional argument in support of the appeal. The Veteran's attorney further indicated that the Veteran did not want a hearing in this matter, that he waived Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) consideration of the evidence submitted with this correspondence, that he waived any notice errors and that he did not have any additional evidence to submit. The Veteran's attorney requested that the Board proceed with its decision.

The appeal of the issues of entitlement to service connection for a right ankle injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, vitiligo, a low back condition, bilateral hearing loss and a sleep disorder is untimely; therefore, the claims are denied.

Pursuant to the October 2024 Joint Motion for Remand, the parties agreed that the Board should address the Veteran's statements in light of the holding in Anania v. McDonough, 1 F.4th 1019, 1022 (Fed. Cir. 2021), address the Board's jurisdictional stance on the one-year deadline for a notice of disagreement and to address arguments raised in the July 2023 submission by the Veteran's representative that the untimely receipt of the notice of disagreement was out of the Veteran's control and he showed good cause for an extension. 

At the outset, the Board notes that an appeal consists of a timely filed notice of disagreement in writing, and after a statement of the case has been furnished, a timely filed substantive appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.200. As to what constitutes a notice of disagreement, the Court has said that the Board determines de novo whether a document is a notice of disagreement. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App.119 (1999); Beyrle v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 24, 27-28 (1996). In this regard, a notice of disagreement is a written statement reasonably expressing disagreement with and a desire to contest any aspect of the adjudication(s). 38 C.F.R. § 20.201. A notice of disagreement requires no special wording or phrasing and is to be evaluated within the context of the overall record. Id.; see also Jarvis v. West, 12 Vet. App. 599, 561-62 (1999).

A claimant or his representative must file a notice of disagreement with a determination of the AOJ within one year from the date that the AOJ mailed notice of the determination. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). A notice of disagreement must be filed with the VA office from which the claimant received notice of the determination being appealed unless notice has been received that the applicable VA records have been transferred to another VA office. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If a notice of disagreement is not filed within the prescribed period, the AOJ decision becomes final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.200, 20.201, 20.302, 20.1103. An untimely notice of disagreement deprives the Board of jurisdiction to consider the merits of an appeal. 38 U.S.C.           § 7105(c).

The date of mailing of the letter of notification from the AOJ will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.110. A notice of disagreement postmarked prior to expiration of the proscribed period will be accepted as having been timely filed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.110. In the event that the postmark is not of record, the postmark date will be presumed to be five days prior to the date of receipt of the document by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 20.110.

In addition to this statutory mailbox rule, there is a common law mailbox rule. Under the common law mailbox rule, 'if a letter properly directed is proved to have been either put into the post office or delivered to the postman, it is presumed, from the known course of business in the post office department, that it reached its destination at the regular time, and was received by the person to whom it was addressed.'" Anania v. McDonough, supra (citing Rios v. Nicholson, 490 F.3d 928, 930-31 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quoting Rosenthal v. Walker, 111 U.S. 185 (1884))). The presumption of receipt under the common law mailbox rule is founded on the probability that government officers will do their duty and the usual course of business. Id. The presumption of receipt attaches when there is evidence demonstrating that the mail was "properly addressed, stamped, and mailed in adequate time to reach its destination in the normal course of post office business "or" evidence of mailing custom or routine practice." Id. at 1027 (quoting Rios, 490 F.3d at 933).

In Anania, the Board concluded that the veteran failed to file a substantive appeal because the claims file did not contain a copy of the substantive appeal stamped with the date of receipt by the VA. Id. at 1021. There, the veteran argued that the substantive appeal should be deemed timely under the common law mailbox rule and submitted a signed affidavit from his representative asserting that the representative personally mailed the substantive appeal. Id. The Board determined that the presumption of receipt under the common law mailbox rule did not attach because the affidavit amounted to no more than self-serving testimony. Id. at 1022. The Court upheld the Board's decision. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held that the common law mailbox rule does not include a per se rule that affidavits are insufficient to invoke the presumption of receipt. Id. at 1027.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.109, time limits for filing to challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended in some cases on a showing of "good cause." Specifically, 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) requires that, where an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, the required action must be taken concurrent with or prior to the filing of a request for extension of the time limit, and good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. There is no legal entitlement to an extension of time; rather, 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) leaves the decision to the sole discretion of VA. Corry v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 231, 235 (1992).

By way of background, the Veteran filed claims for service connection in March 2010, April 2010, June 2010 and October 2010. The Veteran's claims were denied in a March 19, 2012 rating decision that was issued on March 20, 2012. In a March 20, 2012 letter, the AOJ informed the Veteran and his representative that his claims were denied. The AOJ notified the Veteran and his representative of his procedural and appellate rights. However, no correspondence was received from the Veteran or his representative within one year of the March 20, 2012 notification letter.

On March 29, 2013, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement, where he, through his representative, expressed his disagreement with the AOJ's prior March 2012 rating decision. In April 2013, the AOJ informed the Veteran that his March 29, 2013 notice of disagreement was untimely. In an April 2014 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran through his representative noted their disagreement with the AOJ's finding with no explanation as to why they disagreed. In October 2014, the Veteran filed another notice of disagreement alleging that he received a letter from the AOJ that his March notice of disagreement was lost and that he had to refile his notice of disagreement in April 2014. However, there is no evidence from the AOJ stating that they lost his original notice of disagreement in his claims file.

Based on a review of the evidence, the Board finds that a timely notice of disagreement as to the March 2012 rating decision was not received. The Veteran's representative contends that pursuant to Anania v. McDonough, supra, the common law mailbox rule does not include a per se rule that affidavits are insufficient to invoke the presumption of receipt and that the Veteran's self-serving statements are indeed sufficient to invoke the presumption of receipt. However, the Federal Circuit further stated in Anania v. McDonough, that the self-serving statements also must be weighed in the context of all of the other evidence in determining whether or not a document was received. Thus, the Veteran's self-serving statements must still be weighed in the context of all the other evidence the Board received pertaining to the matter. Here, the Veteran did not provide any other evidence that his March 2013 notice of disagreement was properly addressed, stamped, and mailed in adequate time to reach its destination in the normal course of post office business, except for his statements. See Anania v. McDonough, at 1027 (quoting Rios, 490 F.3d at 933). The Veteran did not provide any proof that his notice of disagreement was mailed in adequate time, except for his statements. The Veteran did not provide proof that the handwritten date on his notice of disagreement was the date he actually mailed it, except for his statements. Further, the only other evidence of filing for the Veteran's notice of disagreement is the one presented by his representative, his Veterans Service Officer at the time, which had a March 28, 2013 date. The representative's notice of disagreement was dated and filed after the March 20, 2013 deadline for timely filing. Both the Veteran's filed notice of disagreement and the representative's filed notice of disagreement was received by the VA on the same date, March 29, 2013. So even the representative's filing of the notice of disagreement on behalf of the Veteran was untimely. 

In adjudicating claims, the Board must assess not only competency of the veteran's statements, but also their credibility. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The former, the Court has held, is a legal concept, which is useful in determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while the latter is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted. Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997). Credibility can be generally evaluated by considering interest, bias, or inconsistent statements, the demeanor of the witness, facial plausibility of the testimony, and the consistency of the witness testimony. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 510-511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence it finds persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant. Caluza, 7 Vet. App. at 506 (citing State v. Asbury, 415 S.E.2d 891, 895 (W.Va. 1992)).

In the present case, the Veteran's reports regarding the circumstances surrounding the filing of the March 2013 notice of disagreement have changed over time. In an October 2014 statement signed under the penalty of perjury, the Veteran indicated that he had received a letter from VA informing him that VA had lost or could not find what was sent in March 2013 and that he subsequently refiled the notice of disagreement in April 2014. However, no such letter is located in the claims file and VA has never asserted that a March 2013 filing was lost or misplaced. As such, the Board finds the Veteran's statement to not be credible and assigns them no probative weight. The Veteran's self-serving statements, taken alone, are not sufficient to invoke the presumption of receipt.

After reviewing all of the evidence, including the Veteran's testimony and statements and the Veteran's representative's untimely notice of disagreement filing, and the absence of evidence demonstrating that the mail was properly addressed, stamped, and mailed in adequate time to reach the destination in the normal course of post office business, the Board concludes that the notice of disagreement as to the March 2012 rating decision was not timely even pursuant to Anania v. McDonough, supra. This argument is therefore without merit.

The Veteran's attorney also contends that pursuant to Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024), the one-year deadline in 7105(b) for filing a notice of disagreement is not jurisdictional and that the Board is not categorically precluded from considering matters contained in a notice of disagreement received outside that time frame. Although the Court determined that 7105(b) is not a jurisdictional bar, it also emphasized that "it is an important and mandatory claim-processing rule." The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement within the specified one-year deadline under 7105(b) and the Board is not the requirement of a timely notice of disagreement.

The Board notes that arguments of the Veteran's attorney that the Board must grant an extension of time under 38 C.F.R. § 3.109 for the Veteran to file a notice of disagreement to the March 2012 rating decision in the July 2023 submission. No further explanation or rationale for this assertion was provided by the Veteran's attorney in the July 2023 submission. Significantly, neither the Veteran nor his attorney identified the circumstances for which good cause could be shown for an extension of time to submit a timely notice of disagreement to the March 2012 rating decision. There is no evidence or argument that the Veteran was unable or was in some way prevented from filing a timely notice of disagreement to the March 2012 rating decision, to include but not limited to illness or incapacity. Moreover, neither the Veteran or his attorney provided any explanation as to why a notice of disagreement could not have been filed during the year after the issuance of the March 2012 rating decision and/or could not have been filed sooner than it was. Indeed, the arguments of the Veteran and his attorney are that the March 2013 notice of disagreement was actually timely and that the failure to process it in a timely fashion is VA administrative error. To the extent that the Veteran's attorney has argued in the July 2023 submission that a request for an extension of time is presumed because the Veteran filed the notice of disagreement close to the year deadline, the Board notes that there is no statutory or regulatory support for an implied request for an extension of time. This argument is therefore without merit.

The Veteran's attorney further contends that despite the one-year deadline he also filed a July 2023 Motion to Extend the Deadline for the untimely notice of disagreement. See January 2025 Summary of the Argument. The Motion argued that the Veteran visited his Veterans Service Organization office and completed the notice of disagreement with the help of the Veterans Service Organization. See April 2022 Board Hearing Transcript (pg. 3). The Veteran's attorney argued that the Board implicitly found the Veteran's testimony that he completed the form on that date to be credible and argues that the Veterans Service Organization's untimely filing was out of the Veteran's control, warranting a show for good cause. However, during the April 2022 Board Hearing, the Veteran testified under oath that he personally mailed a copy of the notice of disagreement at the post office after visiting the Veterans Service Organization. See (pg. 7). He also testified that his Veterans Service Organization told him that if he mailed the notice of disagreement on that day, then it would get to the AOJ by Friday, which would be timely as the deadline of the March 20, 2013 was on the following Wednesday. See (pg. 4). Therefore, although the Veteran's Veterans Service Organization representative mailed an untimely notice of disagreement that was out of the Veteran's control, the Veteran himself testified that he was also instructed by the Veterans Service Organization to personally mail a copy of the notice of disagreement on the day he filled out the form and that the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement separately from the Veterans Service Organization. The Veteran's mailing of a timely notice of disagreement, under these circumstances, is within his control. Therefore, the Board does not find that good cause was shown for the failure to file a timely notice of disagreement. This argument is therefore without merit.

The Board has also considered the common law mailbox rule, but still finds that the notice of disagreement is not timely. The Veteran has submitted no proof of mailing. On the other hand, the VA date stamp indicates that the date of mailing was later than the March 20, 2013 time limit. The Veteran testified in the April 2022 Board hearing that he did not receive a confirmation receipt or tracking number when he mailed his notice of disagreement at the post office. See (pg. 5). Accordingly, the Board concludes that in the absence of evidence to the contrary (which has neither been submitted or even argued by the Veteran), the notice of disagreement was not timely filed under the common law mailbox rule. Although the Veteran's attorney argues in the July 2023 submission that the written date of March 13, 2013 on the notice of disagreement establishes that it was timely as to the March 2012 rating decision, the Board disagrees. The handwritten date on the March 2013 notice of disagreement merely establishes that this was the date written on the document by the Veteran-it does establish the date of mailing or even establish that this was the actual and correct date of signing, as the notice of disagreement itself was not witnessed or somehow certified. Therefore, after reviewing all of the evidence, the Board concludes that the notice of disagreement as to the March 2012 AOJ decision was not timely.

Therefore, the Board concludes that the appeal of the issues of entitlement to service connection for a right ankle injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, vitiligo, a low back condition, bilateral hearing loss and a sleep disorder is not timely. The appeal is denied.  38 U.S.C. §5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
