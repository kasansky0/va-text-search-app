DOCKET NO. 240703-455351
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chloracne is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, his chloracne is related to his conceded exposure to herbicide agents during military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for chloracne have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 1154, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Marine Corps from May 1969 to May 1971. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in February 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for chloracne.

The Veteran claims he has chloracne related to exposure to herbicide agents during service. In his July 2023 Fully Developed Claim, the Veteran reported that when he was in Vietnam, he was exposed to Agent Orange.  He recalled several occasions when airplanes were spraying the perimeter of the compound he was on and feeling the spray on his skin. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. Id.; see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Service connection on a presumptive basis may be established for certain enumerated diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e) associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents used in support of military operations in Vietnam during the Vietnam era. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6). A veteran is presumed to have been exposed to herbicides if he or she served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the Veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(f); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii).  Chloracne is a disease for which presumptive service connection is provided if such manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year after the last date on which the veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during service.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6)ii, (d), 3.309(e).

Notwithstanding the foregoing presumptions, a veteran is not precluded from establishing service connection due to exposure to herbicides with proof of direct causation. Combee v. Brown, 38 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

A December 2023 Toxic Risk Exposure Activity assessment Memorandum shows the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents in service. This finding is consistent with the Veteran's personnel records, which reflect his service in the Republic of Vietnam, as well as with his lay statements about his herbicide exposure in service. 

The Veteran's service treatment records, however, do not reflect complaints of, treatment for, or a diagnosis referable to a skin disorder, to include chloracne.

The Veteran's private treatment records show that he has been treated for chloracne periodically since 1990. The Veteran began receiving treatment at the VA for chloracne in 2001, and his chloracne diagnosis was confirmed by VA providers again in 2002 and 2003.

The Veteran received a VA examination in August 2023. At this examination, the Veteran reported that he was exposed to Agent Orange during his service in Vietnam and that his skin began to grow itchy and sore after service. Per the report, the Veteran developed intermittent skin rashes, acne, abscesses, and cysts, which worsened in intensity, frequency, and duration over time. The examiner reported an onset date of 1972 and found that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's chloracne was incurred in or caused by his service.  The examiner based the favorable opinion on the Veteran's exposure to Agent Orange exposure during service and the evidence of chronicity.

Here, the evidence does not clearly show that the Veteran's chloracne manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year after the last date on which he was exposed to an herbicide agent during active service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(ii).  Nevertheless, pursuant to Combee, the Board affords significant probative value to the VA examiner's opinion, as such was based on the Veteran's competent lay statements and is consistent with the circumstances of his service.  Thus, the Board finds that the probative evidence persuasively weighs in favor of the finding that the Veteran's chloracne was caused by his conceded in-service herbicide exposure under a direct theory of service connection. Therefore, service connection for chloracne is warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
