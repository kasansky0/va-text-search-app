DOCKET NO. 250113-508006
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal with respect to entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A June 2024 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision denied the Veteran's claim for a TDIU.

2. The Veteran died in September 2024.

3. In January 2025, after the Veteran's death, his representative filed a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) to initiate an appeal of the June 2024 denial of a TDIU on the Veteran's behalf.

4. The Veteran's former spouse, S.P., predeceased the Veteran in November 2021 and is not a valid VA claimant.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The January 2025 NOD is invalid.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5121A, 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.631, 20.103, 20.104, 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 1988 to September 1992.  His decorations included the Southwest Asia Service Medal and the Kuwait Liberation Medal.  Unfortunately, he died in September 2024.

In June 2024, prior to the Veteran's death, a VA Regional Office issued a HLR rating decision that denied his claim for a TDIU.  A VA Form 10182 was received in January 2025, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

The Board notes that the Veteran's private attorney requested to withdraw from representation in March 2025.  See March 2025 representative correspondence.  In light of the Veteran's death, that request has become moot.  Because the attorney remained the Veteran's representative at the time of his death, the Board has included the attorney in the case caption, above, for the limited purpose of issuing the present dismissal.

Dismissal

This appeal stems from a VA Form 10182 received on January 13, 2025, and formally acknowledged by the Board on February 12, 2025.  See January 2025 VA Form 10182; February 2025 Board docketing letter.  After careful consideration, the Board finds that this appeal must be dismissed due to a procedural defect.

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7105, an NOD initiating appellate review "may be filed by the claimant, the claimant's legal guardian, or such accredited representative, attorney, or authorized agent as may be selected by the claimant or legal guardian."  However, a power of attorney executed by a veteran ceases to remain effective upon the veteran's death.  The Board must conclude that the January 2025 VA Form 10182 is invalid because it was submitted by the Veteran's attorney after the Veteran's death, when the attorney no longer had any authority to act on the Veteran's behalf.

In arriving at this conclusion, the Board acknowledges that the Board's February 2025 docketing letter was copied to the Veteran's former spouse, S.P., and that the present appeal was docketed under her name.  However, S.P. is not a valid claimant before VA inasmuch as the evidence shows that she predeceased the Veteran in November 2021.  See December 2021 VA letter ("We received information from the Social Security Administration that, S.P., your dependent spouse on your award, passed away on November 29, 2021.").  Further, the record does not reflect that any claimant has requested to be substituted for the Veteran for purposes of pursuing the TDIU issue pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5121A.

In view of the foregoing, the Board finds that the January 2025 NOD is invalid under governing claims processing rules, that the NOD should not have been accepted for docketing, and that the appeal must be dismissed.
