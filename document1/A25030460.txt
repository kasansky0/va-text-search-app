REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from July 1997 to July 2017.

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an October 2022 decision. In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2022 decision. 

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

In a March 2025 VA Form 21-4138, the Veteran submitted in writing his intent to withdraw his appeal from the February 2025 Notice of Disagreement in its entirety. 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the evaluation of right upper extremity radiculopathy and cubital tunnel syndrome with radial nerve, median nerve, ulnar nerve.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the evaluation of left upper extremity radiculopathy and cubital tunnel syndrome with radial nerve, median nerve, and ulnar nerve. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. 

In March 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran submitted a statement which included his name, was signed by the Veteran, and identified the appeal which he wished to withdraw. See March 2025 Statement in Support of Claim. The statement indicated that "I respectfully request to voluntarily withdraw the February 5, 2025, Notice of Disagreement (Direct) in its entirety. Thus, I am asking the Board to dismiss the appeals for entitlement to an earlier effective date for increased rating for right and left upper extremities. Thank you for your assistance." Id. The Board therefore finds that this statement satisfies the requirements for a written withdrawal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205; see also Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020). Accordingly, the Board additionally finds that the appeal with respect to these issues has been withdrawn.

Given the above, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration in regard to these issues. Consequently, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeals as to these issues, and they are dismissed.
