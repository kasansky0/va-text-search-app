ORDER

The appeal seeking entitlement to an effective date prior to September 29, 2023, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Following a January 2024 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a request for higher-level review in February 2024, seeking an effective date prior to September 29, 2023, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

2. While the Veteran's request for higher-level review of the January 2024 rating decision was pending final adjudication, he submitted a Notice of Disagreement with the January 2024 rating decision in May 2024, seeking an effective date prior to September 29, 2023, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Veteran's appeal for an effective date prior to September 29, 2023, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is barred by the rules against concurrent election of review options, and the criteria for dismissal of the appeal have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from August 2010 to November 2010 and from April 2011 to April 2012.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in January 2024.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 29, 2023, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

After the issuance of a rating decision, a claimant may submit a request for higher-level review (HLR), an appeal to the Board, or a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a). A claimant who has filed for review under one of those options may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

The January 2024 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, effective September 29, 2023. In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a request for HLR, expressing disagreement with the effective date assigned for the award of service connection for sleep apnea. In May 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), also expressing disagreement with the effective date assigned for the award of service connection for sleep apnea. The RO issued a HLR rating decision in June 2024, granting an earlier effective date of June 1, 2023, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. 

Unfortunately, the Board finds that the present appeal must be dismissed because the Veteran's May 2024 Board appeal is invalid. In this regard, the Veteran submitted a request for HLR of the effective date assigned for the award of service connection for sleep apnea in February 2024, and his May 2024 Notice of Disagreement regarding the same issue was received while that HLR request was pending final adjudication. Concurrent election of review options is prohibited. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). Therefore, the May 2024 Notice of Disagreement is not valid, and the appeal seeking an effective date prior to September 29, 2023, must be dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.205.  

The Board notes that the one-year period for requesting review of the June 2024 HLR rating decision has not yet elapsed. Therefore, if the Veteran is still in disagreement with the effective date assigned for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, he may submit a supplemental claim or Notice of Disagreement within one year after receiving notice of the July 15, 2024, rating decision.
