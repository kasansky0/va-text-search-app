ORDER

Readjudication of a claim of entitlement to service connection for general anxiety disorder is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's claim for service connection for general anxiety disorder was previously denied within a September 2020 rating decision; since that time, new evidence has not been received that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for readjudication of a claim of entitlement to service connection for general anxiety disorder have not been met.  38 C.F.R. §§ 5108, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156, 3.2501.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for anxiety most recently addressed in a September 2020 rating decision.  In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  Therefore, the Board must determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based only on the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that in February 2025, the Veteran submitted an unsigned request to advance her appeal on the docket.  Given that this matter is already before the undersigned, the Board finds no resulting harm to the Veteran in proceeding to adjudicate this matter; moreover, the Board will not further delay this decision by invoking the advance on the docket procedures.

Readjudication of a claim of entitlement to service connection for general anxiety disorder.

In general, decisions of the RO or the Board are final.  38U.S.C. §7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302. 20.1103.  A claimant may request adjudication of a previously denied claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. VA will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156.  New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.  The term "relevant evidence" means evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue in a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.  Id.

This matter was previously denied within a September 2020 rating decision which found that the Veteran's general anxiety disorder did not have onset during active service and was not otherwise related to active service.  Following that rating decision, the Veteran did not appeal the matter or submit new and relevant evidence.  

Evidence received subsequent to the September 2020 rating decision, including in conjunction with the Veteran's December 2023 supplemental claim, includes updated VA treatment records up to March 2023.  Notably, these records, including a copy of the Veteran's prior September 2020 VA examination, were of record and reviewed by the AOJ in conjunction with the September 2020 rating decision. As such, these records are duplicative of evidence previously considered and are not new evidence.  Indeed, since the September 2020 rating decision, the Veteran has not submitted or identified new evidence that tends to prove or disprove the claim of entitlement to service connection for generalized anxiety disorder.  Accordingly, there is no new or relevant evidence to warrant readjudication of this matter. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).

The Board notes that in March 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran characterized her claim as a secondary service connection claim, asserting that her anxiety is related to her now service-connected back and migraine disabilities.  However, to the extent that her March 2024 VA Form 10182 raises a new theory of entitlement not previously considered that might otherwise constitute new and relevant evidence, it cannot be considered in determining whether new and relevant evidence has been presented or secured with respect to the current appeal.  In her March 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket, and as such, the evidentiary record before the Board is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision.

In sum, because new and relevant evidence has not been received, readjudication of the claim for generalized anxiety disorder is denied. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).  In reaching this decision, the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not in approximate balance, the doctrine is not for application. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
