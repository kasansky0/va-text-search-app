REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 1974 to June 1994.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). If a claim is filed within one year after separation from service, service connection will be effective as of the day after separation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Regarding the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, on a facts-found basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he or she actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008). However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the RO receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers. McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. The percentage ratings represent, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries in civil occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations should be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a). Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss every piece of evidence submitted by the Veteran or on his behalf. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claims and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claims. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000).

When determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign, the Board's primary consideration is the Veteran's symptoms, but it must also make findings as to how those symptoms impact the Veteran's occupational and social impairment. See Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 118 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The use of the term "such as" in the rating criteria demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, the Board need not find the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms to award a specific rating. See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). Nevertheless, as all ratings in the general rating formula are also associated with objectively observable symptomatology and the plain language of the regulation makes it clear that the Veteran's impairment must be "due to" those symptoms, a veteran may only qualify for a given disability by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration. See Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 118.

1. Earlier effective date for service connection for chronic lymphocytic leukemia

2. Earlier effective date for service connection for hypertension

3. Earlier effective date for service connection for scars, status post radical prostatectomy

4. Earlier effective date for service connection for erectile dysfunction.

5. Earlier effective date for service connection for prostate cancer status post prostatectomy 

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for service connection for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hypertension, scars status post radical prostatectomy, erectile dysfunction, and prostate cancer status post prostatectomy.

Pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), the AOJ awarded service connection for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hypertension, scars status post radical prostatectomy, erectile dysfunction, and prostate cancer status post prostatectomy on a presumptive basis, effective August 10, 2022, in a June 2023 rating decision.

For claims pending on or before the enactment of the PACT Act, the earliest possible effective date for a grant of service connection pursuant to the PACT Act is August 10, 2022. See 38 C.F.R. § 5110(g).

The Board notes that the holdings in the Nehmer cases established an exception to 38 C.F.R. § 5110(g), in that "Nehmer class members" could be assigned earlier effective dates than the date of the law and regulations that established presumptive service connection for a "covered herbicide disease." See 38 C.F.R. § 3.816(c)(2); see also Nehmer v. United States Veterans Administration, 712 F. Supp. 1404 (N.D. Cal. 1989) (Nehmer I); Nehmer v. United States Veterans Administration, 32 F. Supp. 2d. 1175 (N.D. Cal. 1999) (Nehmer II); Nehmer v. Veterans Administration of the Government of the United States, 284 F.3d 1158 (9th Cir. 2002) (Nehmer III).

A Nehmer class member is defined as a Vietnam veteran who has been diagnosed with a disorder presumptively associated with herbicide exposure. An earlier effective date may apply if a Nehmer class member was denied compensation for such disorder between September 25, 1985 and May 3, 1989; or if there was a claim for benefits pending before VA between May 3, 1989 and the effective date of the applicable liberalizing law. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.816(c). In these situations, the effective date of the award will be the later of the date such claim was received by VA or the date the disability arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.816 (c)(1), (c)(2). 

Looking to the claims file, the first communication VA received from the Veteran expressing an intent to file a claim of service connection for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hypertension, scars status post radical prostatectomy, erectile dysfunction, and prostate cancer status post prostatectomy was received on March 17, 2023. The evidence does not show: (1) VA denied compensation for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hypertension, scars status post radical prostatectomy, erectile dysfunction, and prostate cancer status post prostatectomy in a decision issued between September 25, 1985 and May 3, 1989; or (2) claims for disability compensation for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hypertension, scars status post radical prostatectomy, erectile dysfunction, and prostate cancer status post prostatectomy either pending before VA on May 3, 1989 or received by VA between May 3, 1989 and the effective date of the regulation establishing a presumption of service connection for those disabilities. As such, earlier effective dates for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hypertension, scars status post radical prostatectomy, erectile dysfunction, and prostate cancer status post prostatectomy cannot be granted under Nehmer. 38 C.F.R. §3.816.

While the Board is sympathetic, an earlier effective date may not be assigned under the governing law. The evidence in this case is not so evenly balanced so as to allow application of the benefit-of- the-doubt rule, which, in close cases, can tip the evidentiary scales in a veteran's favor. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. This is not such a case. Accordingly, entitlement to earlier effective dates for the grant of service connection for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hypertension, scars status post radical prostatectomy, erectile dysfunction, and prostate cancer status post prostatectomy are denied.

6. Increased rating for chronic lymphocytic leukemia

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

The Veteran's chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been rated noncompensable under 38 C.F.R. § 4.117, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7703.

Under DC 7703 (leukemia (except for chronic myelogenous leukemia)) provides for a 100 percent disability rating when there is active disease or during a treatment phase. Otherwise, residuals are rated under the appropriate DC(s). DC 7703 provides a noncompensable rating for asymptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia or monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) Rai Stage 0. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in June 2023. The Veteran reported symptoms of fatigue and intermittent swollen lymph nodes. The examiner noted the Veteran's chronic lymphocytic leukemia was asymptomatic, Rai Stage 0. The examiner indicated that the condition was active however they further noted that chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a chronic type of cancer and is not typically categorized as active or not active. Continuous medication required for control of the condition was not required and the Veteran was not undergoing treatment for his condition. The Veteran did not have anemia, thrombocytopenia, or polycythemia vera. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not experience functional impact from his condition.

Private medical records form the appeal period also indicate that the Veteran's chronic lymphocytic leukemia was asymptomatic.

Therefore, based on the record contained within the evidentiary window, the Board finds a compensable rating for the Veteran's chronic lymphocytic leukemia is not warranted.

As the evidence is against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply. See, 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

7. Earlier effective date increased rating for bilateral hearing loss

In his February 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran indicated that he was seeking review of the "rating evaluation [and] effective date" for his bilateral hearing loss disability.

The Veteran was granted service connection for bilateral hearing loss in a July 2010 rating decision effective December 8, 2009. The Veteran did not file any appeals of this decision within one year of the determination and the July 2010 rating decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103.

In March 2023 the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) seeking an increased rating for bilateral hearing loss. The claim was denied in a June 2023 rating decision. 

In July 2023 the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application seeking an increased rating and earlier effective date for bilateral hearing loss. A December 2023 rating decision denied the claim for increased rating for bilateral hearing loss. In February 2024 the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review seeking review of the December 2023 rating decision. The February 2024 rating decision on appeal once again denied the increased rating for bilateral hearing loss claim.

As noted above, the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss was granted in a July 2010 rating decision and the time to appeal the effective date for the grant of service connection has expired. In Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006), the Court held that once a rating decision that establishes an effective date for an award becomes final, as is the case here, the only way that such a decision can be revised is if it contains CUE. In Rudd, the Court held that there can be no valid "freestanding" earlier effective date claim raised at any time after a RO decision becomes final. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 300. The Court further indicated that because "there is no proper claim...," the matter must be dismissed. Id.

There is no CUE claim before the Board. To the extent that the Veteran has attempted to raise a freestanding earlier effective date claim and in light of Rudd, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 8, 2009, for the award service connection for bilateral hearing loss must be dismissed.

To the extent that the Veteran intended to seek an earlier effective date for an increased evaluation for bilateral hearing loss the Board does not have jurisdiction to address this claim. It is not possible for the Veteran to disagree with the assignment of an increased evaluation that has never been awarded. As such the claim must be dismissed. 

8. Increased rating for bilateral hearing loss

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran is currently service connected for bilateral hearing loss with a noncompensable rating.

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of speech discrimination tests together with the average hearing threshold levels as measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz. To evaluate the degree of disability for service-connected hearing loss, the rating schedule establishes 11 auditory acuity levels, designated from Level I through Level XI for profound deafness. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII, Diagnostic Code 6100.

Disability ratings for hearing impairment are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are rendered. See Bruce v. West, 11 Vet. App. 405,409. The percentage evaluation is derived from Table VII in 38 C.F.R. § 4.85 by intersecting the vertical column corresponding to the numeric designation for the ear having the better hearing acuity and the horizontal row corresponding to the numeric designation for the ear having the poorer hearing acuity.

Upon review of the Veteran's record, his most recent hearing examination occurred in May 2023. Puretone thresholds, in decibels, from audiometric testing in the examination, for the frequencies of interest, in Hertz, were as follows:

HERTZ	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg

RIGHT	30	25	60	50	41

LEFT	65	50	75	70	65

Speech recognition scores based on the Maryland CNC Test were 94 percent in the right ear and 94 percent in the left ear. The Veteran's bilateral hearing exam does not show an exceptional pattern of hearing impairment; thus, Table VI is applicable.

Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level I in the right ear and Level II in the left ear. Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level I for the right ear and Level II for the left ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a 0 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6100. An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

Based on the evidence above, a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is not warranted.

9. Increased rating for hypertension.

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for hypertension.

For the entirety of the appeal period, the Veteran was assigned a noncompensable rating under DC 7101 for his hypertension. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

Under DC 7101 rating criteria, a 10 percent rating for hypertension is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control; a 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more; a 40 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more; and a maximum 60 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria. Merriam-Webster defines "predominant" as "being most frequent or common." See merriam-webster.com, last visited May 18, 2024.

Under Diagnostic Code 7101, "a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more [that] requires continuous medication for control" refers to blood pressure readings taken before a veteran began medication to control hypertension, and therefore requires analyzing blood pressure readings prior to the appeal period. See Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021).

The Veteran's VA treatment records and private treatment records shows that he has not had a blood pressure reading in which his systolic pressure was 160 or more. A January 2023 private treatment note recorded a reading of 158/85. There were no readings that indicated a diastolic pressure of 100 or more. 

The Veteran was afforded VA examinations for his condition in May 2023. The VA examiner recorded the following readings: 146/78, 128/86, and 140/79. 

After carefully considering the evidence, the Board finds that a compensable rating for hypertension is not warranted.

The Veteran's blood pressure was taken multiple times during the appeal period. None of readings taken at the May 2023 VA examination resulted in a systolic pressure of 160 or more or a diastolic pressure of 100 or more. Likewise, neither of the readings shown in VA treatment records and private treatment records reflect a systolic pressure of 160 or more or a diastolic pressure of 100 or more.

Thus, after review of the record, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in a diastolic pressure predominantly (i.e., most commonly) 100 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more during the appeal period. See merriam-webster.com.

Turning to whether the Veteran is an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control, the Board notes that that the May 2023 examiner indicated that the Veteran requires continuous medication for control of his hypertension (i.e., ameliorative medication). At the May 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported he was diagnosed with hypertension in 2010 and began using medication. 

At the May 2023 VA examination there were no readings showing a diastolic pressure of 100 or more. Additionally, none of the blood pressure readings in the Veteran's VA treatment records or private treatment records reflect a diastolic pressure of 100 or more. As the evidence of record prior to the Veteran's use of ameliorative medication demonstrates that his most common readings do not reflect a diastolic pressure of 100 or more, the Veteran does not have a history of diastolic pressure predominantly over 100. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104; See Wilson, 35 Vet. App. 75.

As the Veteran's hypertension is not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more that required continuous medication for control, a compensable rating for his hypertension is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104 

Considering the above, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran meets the criteria for a compensable rating for hypertension; accordingly, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply, and the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

10. Increased rating for service connection for scar status post radical prostatectomy

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for scar status post radical prostatectomy.

The Veteran's scar status post radical prostatectomy is currently rated under Diagnostic Code 7802. Under Diagnostic Code 7802, a 10 percent disability rating requires that the scars not be of the head, face, or neck and manifest in an area or areas of, or more than, 929 square centimeters (144 square inches).

In a May 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted the presence of abdominal surgical scars due to robotic prostatectomy. The first scar was measured as 5 centimeters (1.97 inches) long and 0.2 centimeters (0.08 inches) wide for a square centimeter measurement of 1 centimeters squared. The two accessory scars were measured at 1.5 centimeters (0.59 inches) by 0.1 centimeter (0.04 inches) wide each for a square centimeter measurement of 0.15 centimeters per scar. This brings the total scar coverage of the posterior trunk to an area of 1.3 centimeters squared. Furthermore, during the exam those scars were not reported as painful or unstable. This is below the 929 square centimeters necessary for a compensable rating of ten percent.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7802 because the Veteran's scar status post radical prostatectomy is not manifest by an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or greater.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars. Under Diagnostic Code 7804, one or two scars that are unstable or painful scars warrants a 10 percent rating. Three or four scars that are unstable or painful scars warrants a 20 percent rating. Five or more scars that are unstable or painful warrants a 30 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 7804 instructs that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. Id. However, at the May 2023 the Veteran's scars were not found to be painful or unstable.

The remaining Diagnostic Codes are not relevant to the Veteran's disability. The Veteran's scar status post radical prostatectomy is not of the head, face, or neck, are not deep and non-linear, and are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7800 and 7801 are inapplicable. Finally, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 as contemplated under Diagnostic Code 7805.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for posterior trunk scars. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
