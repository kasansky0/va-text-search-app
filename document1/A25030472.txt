ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for dermatitis is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for anxiety condition is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's dermatitis does not result in characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of either the entire body affected or the exposed areas affected; or, intermittent systemic therapy required for a total of less than 6 weeks over the past 12 month period.

2. The most probative evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for dermatitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7806.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 4.125.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2007 to August 2012.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims of entitlement to a compensable initial rating for dermatitis and service connection for PTSD, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for anxiety and obstructive sleep apnea, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board is also cognizant of the ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  In Rice, the Court held that a claim for a total rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU), either expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record, involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability and is part of the claim for an increased rating.  The Veteran has not argued, and the record does not otherwise reflect, that his skin condition renders him unemployable during the period on appeal.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that a claim for a TDIU has not been raised.

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for dermatitis.

Disability ratings are determined by application of the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; see generally 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating applies.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Where, as here, the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the medical evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of the assignment of different ratings for distinct periods of time, based on the facts found, is required.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 780-81 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran seeks an initial increased rating for his dermatitis, which is currently rated noncompensable pursuant to the General Rating Formula for the Skin.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7806.  Under this formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned where there is no more than topical therapy required over the past 12 month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected. 

A 10 percent rating requires at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12 month period.

A 30 percent rating requires at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12 month period.

A 60 percent rating requires at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy required over the past 12 month period.

The 10, 30, and 60 percent criteria list examples of types of systemic therapy as including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs.

Alternatively, the rating criteria states to rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck under Diagnostic Code 7800, or as scars under Diagnostic Codes 7801 through 7805, depending upon the predominant disability.

Systemic therapy is defined as treatment that is administered through any route (orally, injection, suppository, intranasally) other than the skin, and topical therapy is defined as treatment that is administered through the skin.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in December 2023, upon which it was confirmed he had a diagnosis of dermatitis.  See December 2023 VA examination.  The Veteran reported first experiencing red, burning bumps all over his arms, back, and armpits and initially sought treatment with private dermatologists who gave him topical steroids.  Id.  He reported he started care at the VA in September 2012 and has not seen a dermatologist for a decade and none at the VA.  Id.  He reported he mostly gets breakouts when it is hot and when he sweats; he has some rash; and gets rashes from nickel.  Id.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's treatment includes hydrocortisone cream used 6 weeks or more, but not constant for the past 12 months, and benadryl used for less than 6 weeks in the past 12 months.  Id.  The VA examiner noted both medications are topical only.  Id.  The Veteran's skin condition was noted to affect less than 5 percent of his total body area, and less than 5 percent of exposed areas.  Id.  The Veteran did not have any scarring or disfigurement due to his skin condition.  Id.  The VA examiner noted that in the summertime the Veteran sweats and itches, and while he can function, it affects his mood.  Id.  

The Veteran's VA treatment records note the Veteran has eczema and that he is prescribed hydrocortisone cream that is to be applied topically.  See March 2022 and November 2023 VA treatment records.  A March 2022 VA treatment record noted the Veteran had eczema skin on his right third finger.  However, VA treatment records do not demonstrate the Veteran's skin condition affects at least 5 percent or more of his entire body or exposed areas; nor, do they demonstrate the Veteran's treatment consists of systemic therapy. 

The Veteran's representative asserts the December 2023 VA examination is inadequate on flare ups and contends they were not mentioned.  See August 2024 appellate brief.  The Veteran's representative asserts skin conditions are notoriously prone to them and to be provoked by emotional stress.  Id.  However, there is no indication the Veteran specifically reported any flare ups other than what he reported at the examination, including that he mostly gets breakouts when it is hot and humid and when he sweats.  The VA examiner considered the Veteran's lay statements and still found that the Veteran's skin condition affected less than 5 percent of his total body area and less than 5 percent of exposed areas.  Additionally, all examiners are presumed to be competent, and their medical opinions are assumed to be adequate absent specific evidence to the contrary.  See Nohr v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 124, 131-32 (2014) ("It is now well settled that 'VA benefits from a [rebuttable] presumption that it has chosen a person who is qualified to provide a medical opinion in a particular case.'").  There is no indication that the VA examiner failed to consider the Veteran's lay statements in concluding the Veteran's skin condition affected less than 5 percent of his total body area and less than 5 percent of exposed areas. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that an initial compensable disability rating for the Veteran's dermatitis is not warranted.  A higher rating of 10 percent requires characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent of the entire body or exposed areas affected or treatment with intermittent systemic therapy.  The evidence persuasively weighs against such findings.  In that regard, all of the medications used by the Veteran to treat his condition are topical and thus do not meet VA's definition of systemic therapy under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).  

To the extent that the Veteran contends that his skin condition is more severe than reflected by his current disability rating, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran can attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge and understanding as a lay person, such as symptoms.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, he is not competent to state that his skin condition is of a severity sufficient to warrant a higher rating under DC 7806 because such an opinion requires medical expertise and knowledge that he has not been shown to possess.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  As such, the Board finds the December 2023 VA examination is adequate for decision making purposes and entitled to significant probative weight.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295, 302 (2008). 

Accordingly, the Board finds that there is no basis upon which to award the Veteran a compensable rating under the General Rating Formula for the Skin at any time during the appeal period.  Finally, as there is no evidence that the Veteran's skin condition results in scarring or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck, separate or higher ratings under DCs 7800 through 7805 are not warranted. 

As the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of a higher rating, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application, and the appeal must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  

The Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 495 (2016); Doucette v. Shulkin, 38 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).  

Entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

The Veteran initially sought service connection for PTSD, anxiety (addressed below), and major depression.  See November 2023 VA Form 21-526.

Generally, service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury in or aggravated by active service. 38?U.S.C. §?1131; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).  To establish service connection for a disability, there must be (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

To establish service connection for PTSD, the evidence must satisfy three basic elements.  There must be 1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; 2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms of PTSD and an in-service stressor; and 3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).

For cases certified to the Board on or after August 4, 2014, a diagnosis of PTSD must be in accordance with the criteria as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual (DSM)-5.  38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a).  As the Veteran's claim was was received in November 2023, a diagnosis of PTSD must conform to the DSM-5.

As an initial matter, the Board notes the AOJ conceded the Veteran had service in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

With respect to the Veteran's claim to entitlement to service connection for PTSD, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record does not support a diagnosis for PTSD.  In that regard, VA treatment records note the Veteran's report that he believes he has PTSD; however, they do not contain a diagnosis for PTSD.  For example, a May 2022 VA treatment record noted the Veteran had combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, but he has never been diagnosed with PTSD and denied classic symptoms of PTSD.  A December 2023 VA treatment record noted the Veteran did not meet the criteria for PTSD.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA PTSD examination in December 2023.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran has current diagnoses of other specified trauma-and stressor-related disorder (which was service connected) and alcohol use disorder.  See December 2023 VA examination.  The VA examiner determined the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD due to lack of avoidance symptoms (criterion C) and insufficient alterations in mood symptoms (Criterion D) required for such a diagnosis.  Id.  

The Veteran's representative asserted a lack of understanding of the finding of no avoidance in the PTSD checklist in the December 2023 VA examination and that they thought alcohol was a common means of avoidance through intoxication.  See August 2024 appellate brief.  However, the evidence of record does not support a finding of a PTSD diagnosis as discussed above.  The Veteran, nor his representative, have provided any evidence to support a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's statements; however, to the extent that the Veteran asserts he has a diagnosis for PTSD related to his military service, the Board notes that he has been shown to have the medical training necessary to be deemed competent to diagnose such condition.  See Jandreau, 402 F.3d at 1377; Kahana, 24 Vet. App. at 435.  Moreover, the Veteran has not provided any competent evidence diagnosing the Veteran with PTSD that conforms to the DSM-5.  Additionally, the December 2023 VA examiner determined the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the criteria for PTSD under the DSM-5, which is the same conclusion a VA Staff Psychologist came to while treating the Veteran for his mental health a few days later in December 2023.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38?U.S.C. §?1110; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary).  In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3?Vet. App.?223, 225 (1992).  The most probative evidence of record demonstrates the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis for PTSD that conforms with the DSM-5 at any time during, or proximate to the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304(f), 4.125(a).  Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record is against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim to entitlement to service connection for PTSD must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).   

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the AMA, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

Entitlement to service connection for anxiety condition is remanded.

As noted above, the Veteran initially sought service connection for multiple psychiatric conditions, including anxiety.  See November 2023 VA Form 21-526.

In this case, the Veteran's service treatment records note the Veteran was assessed with anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) while in service.  See March 2010 service treatment records.  The Veteran was also assessed with adjustment disorder with anxious mood in September 2010.  See September 2010 service treatment records.  In May 2012, the Veteran's separation examination noted a past medical history that includes anxiety and adjustment disorders, and anxiety and adjustment disorder documentation existed for listed medical conditions.  See May 2012 service treatment records.  However, a review of systems indicated no psychological symptoms at the time of the May 2012 separation examination.  Id.

VA treatment records indicate the Veteran's report of anxiety symptoms and that he has been diagnosed with anxiety on multiple occasions.  See May 2022, November 2022, August 2023, and December 2023 VA treatment records.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2023.  When VA provides the veteran with an examination in a service connection claim, the examination must be adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2017).  For a medical opinion to be adequate, it must be: (1) based upon sufficient facts or data; (2) be the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) be the result of principles and methods reliably applied to the facts.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. at 302.

The VA examiner noted the Veteran's report of having high irritability and decreased concentrating ability while in service and that the Veteran was started on medication for anxiety disorder NOS.  See December 2023 VA examination.  The VA examiner did not specifically provide a separate diagnosis for anxiety despite anxiety being listed as a diagnosis throughout his VA treatment records.  Id.  It is unclear whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of anxiety, as demonstrated in the Veteran's VA treatment records, that is at least as likely as not related to the Veteran's active service.   As such, the December 2023 VA medical opinion is inadequate for decision-making purposes.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. at 302.     

The Board notes the VA examiner noted the Veteran had anxiety symptoms that led him to taking Xanax prior to joining the Army.  See December 2023 VA examination.  However, the VA examiner did not indicate when that occurred prior to the Veteran entering service, or whether it had resolved prior to service, and the Veteran's September 2007 enlistment examination does not indicate the Veteran had a diagnosis of anxiety at the time of entering service.  As such, the presumption of soundness attaches, and the Veteran is presumed to be sound.  38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).   

The AOJ's failure to provide the Veteran with an adequate VA medical opinion addressing the Veteran's claim for service connection for anxiety is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  As such, remand is necessary for additional development.  

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  See November 2023 VA Form 21-526.  The Veteran asserted his sleep apnea is connected to poor sleep in service.  Id.  

As an initial matter, the AOJ conceded the Veteran has a current diagnosis for obstructive sleep apnea and that he participated in a toxic exposure risk activity.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran's service treatment records demonstrate the Veteran reported problems sleeping or still feeling tired after sleeping when he returned from deployment.  See March 2010 post-deployment health assessment.  However, the Veteran's separation examination was silent for any complaints or symptoms related to any sleep conditions.  See May 2012 service treatment records. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2023.  The Veteran reported he has been told he snores by his ex-girlfriend years ago and said he stopped breathing.  See December 2023 VA examination.  The VA examiner opined the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was not at least as likely as not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).  Id.  However, the VA examiner did not address the Veteran's lay statements indicating he was told he snored and stopped breathing years ago or his service treatment records noting he reported poor sleep while in service.  As such, the December 2023 VA medical opinion is inadequate for decision making purposes.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008).  

The AOJ's failure to provide the Veteran with an adequate VA medical opinion was a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  As such, remand is necessary for additional development. 

Finally, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's representative contends that favorable private medical nexus statements have been submitted that considered the signs and symptoms that the VA medical opinion for service connection for sleep apnea did not. See August 2024 appellate brief.  However, the March 2024 rating decision does not list any private medical nexus statement as evidence nor is such evidence associated with the claims file.  If the Veteran and/or his representative have such evidence, they are encouraged to submit it while the appeal is remanded for development.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum medical opinion to determine that nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed anxiety.  If the clinician determines that a new examination is necessary to provide the requested opinion, such examination should be scheduled.  The clinician must address the following:

(a.) Clarify whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of anxiety during the appeal period, and/or proximate to the claim.  

(b.) Opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any diagnosed anxiety is etiologically related to the Veteran's active duty service.

The VA examiner must address the Veteran's VA treatment records indicating the Veteran has a current diagnosis of anxiety, and service treatment records noting assessments for anxiety disorder NOS and adjustment disorder with anxious mood.  See March and September 2010, and May 2012 service treatment records; May 2022, November 2022, August 2023, and December 2023 VA treatment records.  

A complete rationale should be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, he/she should explain why an opinion cannot be provided.  

2. Obtain an addendum medical opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea.  If the clinician determines that a new examination is necessary to provide the requested opinion, such examination should be scheduled.  The examiner must address whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that his sleep apnea is directly related to his active duty service.  

The examiner must consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding poor sleep and being told he snored and stopped breathing years prior to the December 2023 VA examination.  The examiner must address the Veteran's service treatment records noting the Veteran's report of problems sleeping or still feeling tired after sleeping in March 2010 after his deployment. 

A complete rationale should be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, he/she should explain why an opinion cannot be provided.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
