DOCKET NO. 230702-358179
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The July 2023 VA Form 10182 was received more than one year after the January 2020 rating decision denying service connection for CFS, and no good cause was provided for the delay.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for CFS have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, 20.202, 20.203, 20.204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1982 to October 2002. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2020 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Generally, the Board will not entertain an application for review on appeal unless it conforms to the law. See 38 U.S.C. § 7108. Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an appeal consists of a properly completed VA Form 10182 submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails the notice of decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

In the January 2020 rating decision, the RO denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for CFS. The Veteran did not submit an appeal for this decision within one year.

A claimant may request an extension of the period for filing an appeal for good cause. A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

The Veteran submitted two July 2023 Form 10182s, one of them indicating that he was requesting reconsideration for CFS under the PACT Act and identified May 2019 as the date of decision, and the other stated that the issue on appeal was the disability evaluation of CFS, and indicated that he was misled by a medical facility, and identified the date of decision as June 2023.  The Board notes that there is no May 2019 decision in the record; a January 2020 rating decision denied service connection for CFS and a May 2023 rating decision denied a compensable rating for a nasal fracture and allergic rhinitis.  The Board notes that more than a year passed between the January 2020 decision and the July 2023 appeal, and the record includes no rating decision addressing service connection or disability rating of CFS within one year prior to the July 2023 Form 10182s.

On January 10, 2025, the RO sent the Veteran a letter indicating that his appeal request does not meet the necessary procedural requirements because his NOD was received over a year after the January 2020 rating decision denying service connection for CFS.  The letter stated that the Veteran has 60 days from the date of the letter to indicate that he disagrees with the assessment that his NOD was untimely or to request a time extension if there was good cause.  The Veteran did not respond to this letter, and over 60 days has passed since it was sent.  No statement of good cause or extenuating circumstances has been received. Accordingly, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to service connection for CFS is not on appeal and must be dismissed. 

The Board notes that the Veteran can file a supplemental claim and submit new and relevant evidence if he wishes to reopen his claim for service connection for CFS.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

In conclusion, the Veteran's Form 10182 was not timely received, and there is no statement of good cause. Therefore, entitlement service connection for CFS is dismissed as untimely. As shown, the positive and negative evidence are not in a state of balance. Therefore, the Veteran cannot receive benefit of the doubt. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 778 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
