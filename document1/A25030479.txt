ORDER

Entitlement to a 50 percent disability rating, but no higher, for persistent depressive disorder with generalized anxiety disorder (hereinafter acquired psychiatric disorder), from May 18, 2020, is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to August 18, 2021, for the assignment of a 100 percent disability rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability, prior to August 18, 2021, is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

1. From May 18, 2020, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder symptoms most closely approximated occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

2. The severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder symptoms did not more closely approximate total occupational and social impairment prior to August 18, 2021.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for a disability rating of 50 percent, but no higher, for an acquired psychiatric disorder, from May 18, 2020, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9433.

2. The criteria for a disability rating of 100 percent for an acquired psychiatric disorder, prior to August 18, 2021, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9433.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2009 to November 2013.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued April 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2022 decision. In April 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2022 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2022 decision.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to a TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to an increased disability rating, to include an earlier effective date, prior to August 18, 2021, for the assignment of a 100 percent disability rating, for an acquired psychiatric disorder.

The Veteran contends that the severity of his psychiatric symptoms warrants an earlier effective date of October 11, 2019 for the assignment of a 100 percent disability rating. The Veteran's representative has argued that the Veteran has continuously pursued an increased rating since that date.

During the period on appeal, the Veteran was in receipt of a 30 percent disability rating prior to August 18, 2021, and a 100 percent disability rating thereafter.

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increased compensation shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. A claimant may indicate a desire to file a claim by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). If VA receives a complete application form within a year, it will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file. Id. For an increased rating claim, the effective date is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within 1 year from such date, otherwise, it is the date of receipt of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

Continuous pursuit of a claim or an issue can be achieved by timely and properly filing an appropriate review option, generally within one year of an AMA decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c). Under the AMA, a claim for an increased rating filed on a Form 21-526EZ is considered an original increased rating claim based on a change or worsening of a service-connected disability. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p)(1), 3.160(b). As such, in the AMA, when an increased rating claim is filed on a VA Form 21-526EZ it is considered a new claim for an increased rating, not a disagreement with or request to review a prior rating decision. An increased rating claim received on a VA Form 21-526EZ cannot be used as the basis for continuous pursuit of a prior claim for the purposes of an earlier effective date. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). The Board has considered recent case law regarding continuous pursuit; the Board finds that under current caselaw a VA Form 526EZ does not constitute a review option of a prior Board decision, as the form indicates that the Veteran's disability has increased and not that there was error in a prior decision. The efficiency and efficacy of the AMA system is dependent upon following and appropriately responding to the Veteran's choices and contentions.

Here, the instant appeal stems from an intent to file received May 18, 2020, and a VA Form 21-526EZ filed within one year, on August 3, 2020. Accordingly, the date of claim is May 18, 2020. As noted above, the use of a VA Form 21-526EZ constitutes a new increased rating claim and cannot establish continuous pursuit of a prior claim. The Veteran subsequently submitted a Request for Higher-Level Review in February 2021, a Supplemental Claim in September 2021, and a Request for Higher-Level Review in January 2023 that resulted in the April 2023 rating decision on appeal. Accordingly, the appropriate effective date for the assignment of an increased disability rating is the May 18, 2020 date of claim or the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability occurred, to include up to one year prior. 

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

A 30 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, or mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events), cause occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and normal conversation).

A 50 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.

Prior to August 18, 2021

Based on all the lay and medical evidence of record, the Board concludes the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder symptoms warrant a 50 percent disability rating, but no higher, from May 18, 2020. As noted above, the date of the instant claim based on the intent to file is May 18, 2020, and the evidence of record supports that the Veteran's disability symptoms had worsened at that time. 

The Veteran's VA treatment records and September 2020 VA examination report reflect that the Veteran reported worsening anxiety and depression symptoms. The Veteran's VA treatment records reflect that he reinitiated treatment in June 2020 due to worsening symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, and an inability to focus, which he reported caused him employment issues. He endorsed that he experienced symptoms daily.

In an August 2020 statement, the Veteran's friend reported the Veteran had changed after service and that he was aware that the Veteran experienced insomnia, night tremors, nightmares, and memory issues. 

The September 2020 VA examination report reflects that the Veteran's symptoms included depressed mood, anxiety, and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. The examiner concluded the Veteran's level of impairment is best summarized as occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care, and conversation. 

Considering all lay and medical evidence of record and resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds, from May 18, 2020 to August 17, 2021, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms most closely approximated the symptoms contemplated by a 50 percent rating, which are less severe, less frequent, and shorter in duration than those contemplated by a 70 percent rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126. The Board concludes the Veteran's level of impairment during that period most closely approximated occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

In this regard, the Board finds the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's symptoms or level of impairment met or more closely approximated the criteria for a higher 70 percent disability rating prior to August 18, 2021. The Board specifically notes the evidence does not reflect that the Veteran had symptoms of suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships prior to August 18, 2021.

In short, the Board finds that a 50 percent disability rating, but no higher, is warranted from May 18, 2020 to August 17, 2021, and the Veteran's claim is granted to that extent. The Board also finds the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms resulted in the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating prior to August 18, 2021. As such, any claim for a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for that period is denied.

From August 18, 2021

As noted above, the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent disability rating from August 18, 2021. This is the date the Veteran submitted an intent to file prior to submitting the September 2021 Supplemental Claim. The September 2021 Supplemental Claim was submitted with the first evidence of record to reflect that the severity of the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms warranted a higher, 100 percent disability rating. In this regard, the Board notes that a private psychiatric assessment dated September 2021 reflects that the Veteran was found to have severe symptoms including gross impairment in thought processes or communication and disorientation to time or place. Further, an October 2021 VA examiner concluded the Veteran's level of impairment was total occupational and social impairment. 

Prior to August 18, 2021, the evidence of record does not reflect that the Veteran's symptoms caused the level of impairment required for total occupational and social impairment or that the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximated the symptoms associated with a 100 percent disability rating. Specifically, the Board notes the evidence prior to August 18, 2021 does not show gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); or disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. 

As such, there is not a basis to assign the award of a 100 percent disability rating prior to the current date. The Board finds that the evidence does not reflect total social and occupational functional impairment prior to August 2021. As such, the Board concludes that the currently assigned, August 18, 2021, is the earliest effective date available for the assignment of a 100 percent disability rating. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is inapplicable and the Veteran's claim for an effective date, prior to August 18, 2021, for the assignment of a 100 percent disability rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder is denied. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107(b), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.3, 4.7. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability, prior to August 18, 2021.

The Veteran contends that the issue of unemployability due to service-connected disability symptoms has been raised by the record.

When entitlement to a TDIU is raised during an appeal for an increased rating, it is considered part and parcel of the underlying increased rating claim. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). In this situation, the claim for a TDIU has the same appeal period as that of the increased rating claim. Id.

The Veteran submitted a September 2021 private psychological assessment which reported that Veteran has been terminated from all jobs he has held. Further, the Veteran's VA treatment records reflect that in June 2020, he reported he had lost recent jobs due to increased psychiatric symptoms such as increased anxiety, restlessness, and an inability to stay focused enough to complete tasks at home or at work. Accordingly, the Board finds that the issue of a TDIU has been raised as part of the Veteran's increased rating claim and it was a pre-decisional duty to assist error for the AOJ not to develop a TDIU claim. Thus, the Board finds that remand is required.
