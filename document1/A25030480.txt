DOCKET NO. 240304-421428
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of January 30, 2023, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for insomnia is granted, subject to controlling regulations governing the payment of monetary awards.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran continuously pursued the claim of service connection for insomnia under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) from January 30, 2023, the date of claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of January 30, 2023, for the grant of service connection for insomnia are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(b), 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1980 to May 1984.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which continued a 70 percent rating for insomnia.  

In a March 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182), the Veteran timely appealed the January 2024 decision to the Board and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the RO.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on the issue or issues on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board will not consider evidence added to the record after the date of the January 2024 decision on appeal.  If evidence was added during this ineligible period, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, he may at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). 

Entitlement to an effective date of January 30, 2023, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for insomnia

VA amended its adjudication regulations on March 24, 2015 to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  The amendments, however, are only effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Under the former legal authority, any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA, from a veteran or his representative, may be considered an informal claim.  Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If received within one year from the date it was sent to the veteran, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a) (in effect prior to March 24, 2015).

There is no set form that an informal written claim must take.  All that is required is that the communication indicates an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, and identify the benefits sought.  Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351 (1999).

In the present case, the Veteran submitted a Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) on January 30, 2023.  In a June 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for insomnia.  In a July 2023 VA Form 20-0996 (Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review), the Veteran requested Higher-Level Review conducted by the AOJ without an informal conference.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2601.  After Higher-Level Review, the AOJ issued a July 2023 rating decision which denied entitlement to service connection for insomnia.  In July 2023 the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim Application (VA Form 20-0995) and in a September 2023 rating decision the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for insomnia and assigned a 70 percent rating, effective July 28, 2023.  In September 2023, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and claimed, "Service connection for Insomnia Disorder."  Although the AOJ in the January 2024 rating decision adjudicated the Veteran's September 2023 VA Form 20-0995 as if it was an increased rating claim, the Veteran timely appealed the effective date assigned for his service-connected insomnia.  Moreover, the Veteran challenged the assigned effective date in the March 2024 VA Form 10182 and his representative explained in an attached brief why he an effective date of January 30, 2023 is warranted based on continuous pursuit.

Under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the notice of a decision was issued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, continuous pursuit can be established by filing a supplemental claim, requesting higher-level review, or appeal to the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 2.500(c)(1).

As persuasively argued by the Veteran's representative in the March 2024 brief, the July 2023 VA Form 20-0995 was received within one year of the July 2023 rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for insomnia and the September 2023 VA Form 20-0995 was received within one year of the September 2023 rating decision that granted entitlement to service connection for insomnia, thus reflecting that the Veteran continuously pursued his claim for service connection for insomnia.  As the Veteran's initial claim was filed on January 30, 2023, an effective date of January 30, 2023 is warranted for the award of service connection for insomnia based on continued pursuit of this claim.

There is no evidence of any unadjudicated formal or informal claim of service connection for insomnia prior January 30, 2023, and no Intent to File was received within one year prior to the January 30, 2023 claim.  Thus, the evidence persuasively weighs against an effective date earlier than January 30, 2023 and the benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application in this regard.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
