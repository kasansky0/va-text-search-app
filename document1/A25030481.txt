REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1995 to June 1997, as well as additional Army National Guard service.  

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  84 Fed. Reg. 138,171 (Jan. 18, 2019).  This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA's) decision on their claim to seek review.  The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2021 decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In August 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 (Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review).  In October 2021, the AOJ issued a Higher-Level Review decision.  

In January 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) and elected the Hearing Lane docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2021 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days following, the hearing.  38?C.F.R. §?20.302.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative.

An effective withdrawal must be in writing, including the name of the veteran (or claimant or appellant if other than the veteran), the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 5-7 (2020); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  Hembree, 33 Vet. App. at 5.

In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn the issue on appeal via correspondence received in March 2025.  The March 2025 statement contains the Veteran's name, claim number, and specific instruction the Veteran "withdraw my appeal for service-connection for hypertension."  Hence, there are no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205; see Hembree, 33 Vet. App. at 5-7.  His request for a hearing before the Board is accordingly deemed to be effectively withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. § 20.704(e).
