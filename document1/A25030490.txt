DOCKET NO. 240701-452011
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal regarding entitlement to a compensable disability rating for right hand boxer's fracture with residuals (claimed as right hand and fingers injury) is dismissed as withdrawn. 

FINDING OF FACT

In January 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran's authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the U.S. Army from January 1992 to May 1995. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket, and the appeal was docketed on July 15, 2024. See BVA docketing letter. Subsequently, on January 24, 2025, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, sought to withdraw his appeal. See January 2025 third party correspondence.

In a March 7, 2025 letter, the Veteran's attorney representative sought to withdraw her representation. See March 2025 third party correspondence. Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.6, after an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals has been filed, a representative may not withdraw services as representative in the appeal unless good cause is shown on motion.  In addition, a change in representation by the Veteran more than 90 days following receipt of the Notice of Disagreement also requires good cause.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1304.  Thus, as no motion for good cause has been filed upon which the Board could rule, the Veteran's attorney remains the representative of record for purposes of this appeal.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In the present case, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. See January 2025 third party correspondence. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
