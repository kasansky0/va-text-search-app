DOCKET NO. 231127-395646
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal with respect to the issue of entitlement to service connection for paranoid schizophrenia is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

By correspondence received in October 2024, prior to the promulgation of an appellate decision, the Veteran indicated, through his attorney, that he wished to withdraw the present appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran and/or his authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 2006 to February 2008, to include service in Afghanistan.  He also had service in the U.S. Army Reserve, to include a period of active duty for training from July 2005 to November 2005.  His decorations include the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and the Army Commendation Medal.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  The Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) later that month, requesting the hearing review option.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(2).

The appeal with respect to the issue of entitlement to service connection for paranoid schizophrenia is dismissed.

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Only an appellant, or an appellant's authorized representative, may withdraw an appeal.  Id.

Appeal withdrawals must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf), the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  Id.

By correspondence received in October 2024, prior to the promulgation of an appellate decision, the Veteran indicated, through his attorney, that he wished to withdraw the present appeal.  The correspondence included his name and VA file number.  Under the circumstances, the Board finds that the requirements for a proper withdrawal have been satisfied.

As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of error of fact or law for appellate consideration.  The appeal must therefore be dismissed.
