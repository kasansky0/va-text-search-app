ORDER

Service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have a current gastrointestinal disability, to include GERD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for gastrointestinal disability including GERD are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from June 1972 to June 1974.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In a March 2024 VA form 10182 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran appealed this decision and elected the direct review docket. By selecting the direct review docket, the Board must base its decision on the evidence that was before the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of the March 2024 decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is denied.

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1153; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.306. Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. In other words, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant. U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328 (1997). In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not reflect any gastrointestinal complaints, findings, treatment, or diagnoses. The Veteran did have one medical visit for substernal chest pain in April 1973, diagnosed as dyspepsia, which was treated with liquid antacid but had no documented follow-up, and no diagnosis of GERD was made. Further, the Veteran denied such problems on his discharge examination, which was also normal on examination.

The post-service record on appeal contains records which reflect treatment and diagnoses of a variety of medical conditions, but none contain any indication of a current gastrointestinal disability, to include GERD.  There is no diagnosis of GERD or any other gastrointestinal disability in the post-service clinical evidence, nor has the Veteran reported receiving such a diagnosis. The Veteran would be competent to report that he has had an upset stomach, heartburn, recurrent chest pain, difficulty swallowing, or any other symptoms of GERD, but he has not done so on record. The record reflects that he has not been diagnosed as having GERD or any other gastrointestinal disability.

The Board has considered that symptoms such as pain can constitute disability if they cause impairment in earning capacity, despite the absence of underlying, identifiable pathology. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2018). However, the Veteran has not provided evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms or manifestations which rise to the level of a "functional impairment in earning capacity." He has not specifically described manifestations of similar severity, frequency, or duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person. Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8, 17 (2020). Beyond being placed on acid-reducing medications while he was briefly taking arthritis medication, he has not offered evidence tending to show that his reported symptoms rise to a level to affect earning capacity. There are no specific statements regarding the severity, frequency, and duration of any symptoms, or any other information with which to establish that his symptoms would cause impaired earning capacity or affect his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life. Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8 (2020).

Absent any indication that the Veteran currently has a gastrointestinal disability, including GERD, which may be associated with service, an examination is not necessary. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-6 (2006). The Veteran would be advised if he seeks medical services in the future and is found to have a gastrointestinal diagnosis that was present while he was in service, he may wish to file a supplemental claim and have the question readjudicated with the known diagnosis. Again, we will leave instructions on how to file a supplemental claim with this decision.

In sum, the record does not demonstrate a current gastrointestinal disorder, including GERD. In the absence of a current medical diagnosis of a gastrointestinal disorder during or approximate to the pendency of the claim, service connection cannot be granted. Brammer at 225. As the evidence is not in approximate balance and is persuasively against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
