REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depression and anxiety, as secondary to service-connected disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1992 to July 1996. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in October 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depression and anxiety, as secondary to service-connected disability.

The Veteran contends entitlement to service connection for depression and anxiety as secondary to service-connected lumbar spine disability and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. In light of Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009), the Board finds it is appropriate to recharacterize the claim as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depression and anxiety.

In his September 2023 claim, the Veteran reported that he had a lot of anxiety any time he does anything that might flare up his back, stating that it made him nervous and anxious. He explained that he had feelings of depression due to the limitations caused by his service-connected back disability. The Veteran is generally competent to report his own lay symptomatology but not to provide a medical diagnosis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 471 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). When a condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination "medical in nature," and is capable of lay observation. Barr, supra. The Veteran is competent to provide evidence regarding his mental health symptoms at the level required to trigger VA's duty to assist him and obtain an examination and a medical opinion. 

There is competent evidence of persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, evidence of a service-connected disability with an indication that the current symptoms may be associated with the service-connected disability, but a lack of sufficient evidence to decide the claim. Under these circumstances, VA's duty to assist requires it obtain an examination and medical opinion. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006). VA did not obtain either and failure to do so was a pre-decisional duty to assist error. Remand is warranted to correct it. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Afford the Veteran an examination with an appropriate medical professional to determine the nature and etiology of any acquired psychiatric disorder. The record, including this Remand, must be made available to and reviewed by the medical professional. Following a review of the relevant record, the medical professional is asked to address the following:

(a.) Identify all acquired psychiatric disorders that meet or have met the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria since September 2023 or in close proximity thereto. In this regard, the medical professional should address the propriety of all mental health diagnoses of record, if any. 

(b.) For each currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder, is it approximately likely as not that such is 1) due to or caused by service-connected disability or 2) aggravated by service-connected disability?

A rationale for any opinion offered should be provided.
