ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Although the Veteran in the present matter of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis filed a February 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement for this issue, they had previously filed a May 2023, Request for Higher-Level Review, causing an impermissible concurrent election.

2. The Veteran's fibromyalgia constitutes a medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness "MUCMI", presumably related to service in Kuwait. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria have been met for dismissal of the appeal for the issue of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis, because of an improper concurrent election. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

2. The criteria for service connection for fibromyalgia have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.317.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from November 2012 to January 2020.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for fibromyalgia. In February 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for sinusitis. In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a Request for Higher-Level Review for service connection for sinusitis. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 and August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

SERVICE CONNECTION 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). "To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"- the so-called "nexus" requirement." Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established for a current disability on the basis of a presumption that certain chronic diseases, including psychosis, manifesting themselves to a certain degree within a certain time after service must have had their onset in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309(a). Generally, the disease must have manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3). 

For the showing of chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word "chronic." 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). When the disease identity is established, there is no requirement of evidentiary showing of continuity. Id. Continuity of symptomatology is required only where the condition noted during service (or in the presumptive period) is not, in fact, shown to be chronic or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned. Id. When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim. Id. Continuity of symptomatology is only applicable to those diseases recognized as chronic for VA purposes. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (2013); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309.

Service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for a Persian Gulf Veteran who exhibits objective indications of qualifying chronic disability, to include an undiagnosed illness or a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness (MUCMI) that became manifest either during active service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, or at any time thereafter, and which by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis. 38 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(1). Section 405 of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022), eliminated the manifestation period and the degree to which a qualifying chronic disability must manifest to be presumed as due to service in the Persian Gulf as set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.317. The PACT Act is a liberalizing law which, in relevant part, provides for presumptive service connection for covered veterans. 38 U.S.C. § 1120(b).

A MUCMI is defined by a cluster of signs of symptoms, such as CFS, fibromyalgia, and functional gastrointestinal disorders (excluding structural gastrointestinal diseases). 38 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(2)(B), 1118; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(i)(B)(1)-(3).

Under the PACT Act, a covered veteran is any veteran who, on or after August 2, 1990, performed active service while assigned to a duty station in, including airspace above in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, or United Arab Emirates; or any veteran who, on or after September 11, 2001, performed active service while assigned to a duty station in, including airspace above in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Uzbekistan, or any other country determined relevant by the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1117, 1119.

Pertinent to a claim for service connection, such a determination requires a finding of a current disability that is related to an injury or disease in service. Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309 (1993); see also Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143 (1992). Under applicable regulation, the term "disability" means impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries and their residual conditions. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; see also Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 296 (1991); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability").

In McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007), the Court held that the requirement of the existence of a current disability is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time he/she files his/her claim for service connection or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim. However, in Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013), the Court held that when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to a claimant filing a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency.

The veteran can provide competent reports of factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, such as experiencing pain in service, reporting to sick call, being placed on limited duty, and undergoing physical therapy. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a lay person is competent to identify the medical condition (noting that sometimes the lay person will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer), (2) the lay person is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Similarly, laypersons are competent to diagnose and provide nexus opinions to some extent, notably where the diagnosis or opinion is not of a complex nature. Id., see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3rd 1391 (2021).

1. Sinusitis

Appellate review to the Board shall be initiated by the filing of a notice of disagreement in the form prescribed by the Secretary (the VA Form 10182). 38 U.S.C. § 7105(a). Moreover, claimants may elect to review a decision of the AOJ by filing a Supplemental Claim, Higher Level Review request, or Board appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a). Simultaneous appeals of the same issue, however, are not permitted under the AMA. Id.

Accordingly, under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b), the prohibition against concurrent election under the AMA, requesting review of a claim under one lane while a request for review of that claim under another lane is pending review, applies to the facts of the present case. 

As noted above, the May 2023, Request for Higher-Level Review was already pending before the AOJ for the issue of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis. Accordingly, the subsequent February 2024, VA Form 10182 appealing the same issue under the AMA constitutes an impermissible concurrent election. Id.

Recently, the Court emphasized VA's prohibition against concurrent election, holding that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the one-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option." Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 25-26 (2023). The Court's holding in Terry was expressly predicated on finding that multiple review requests were "not pending concurrently" as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A). Id. at 3. As such, the Court's holding in Terry makes clear that only one review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues, due to the prohibition against concurrent election. Id. at 6.

When the Board cannot dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction in certain instances, it can still consider dismissing the appeal for other non-jurisdictional reasons such as a procedural defect. See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021). Therefore, as the Board in the instant matter docketed an impermissible concurrent election for the issue of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis, this is a procedural defect permitting the Board to dismiss this claim at this time. 

2. Fibromyalgia

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia as etiologically related to his active service. The Veteran contends that during active duty they used to carry heavy loads, jumped out of higher vehicles, conducted a lot of physical activities during trainings, maintained poor sleeping schedules, and was going through a lot of stress. These activities caused pain in the muscles, abdomen, back, and neck this pain occurs at night and causes the Veteran to not be able to sleep. At the time of the initial claim, the Veteran asserts that they had to attend water therapy, and chiropractor sessions weekly.

Favorable findings from the August 2023 rating decision included participation in a toxic exposure risk activity due to verified service in Kuwait from February 2015 to October 2015, a diagnosed disability as a review of Denver VAMC treatment records show a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, and a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during your service as service treatment records shows that in July 2019, the Veteran reported disruptions in your sleep due to neck pain. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). 

Here, the Veteran had active service in Southwest Asia and is thus considered a Persian Gulf veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e). The Veteran has diagnoses of fibromyalgia, which is MUCMI and presumptively service connected. The Veteran's fibromyalgia is classified by law as a MUCMI, and the Veteran has verified active service in Kuwait from February 2015 to October 2015. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the criteria for service connection for fibromyalgia pursuant to the PACT Act are met. As such, entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia is warranted, and the appeal is granted.
