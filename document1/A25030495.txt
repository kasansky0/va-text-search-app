ORDER

Entitlement to basic eligibility to educational assistance benefits under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill or Chapter 33) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Claimant served in the National Guard from December 2020 and through the appeal period; he does not have a minimum of 90 aggregate days of qualifying active duty excluding entry level and skill training for the purposes of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and he did not serve a minimum of 30 continuous days on active duty where he was discharged under other than dishonorable conditions due to a service-connected disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under the provisions of the Post-9/11 GI Bill are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101(2), (22)(A), (24)(B), 3301, 3311; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.9500, 21.9505, 21.9520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Claimant served in the National Guard beginning in December 2020 and through the appeal period.  He appeals an October 2022 decision letter by the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Muskogee Regional Office (RO) denying basic eligibility of entitlement to Chapter 33 education benefits and requested the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) conduct a direct review of the evidence considered by the RO.  See October 2022 VA Form 10182.

Under the direct docket, the Board will consider the same record as that before the RO at the time of the October 2022 decision letter.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the October 2022 decision letter.  Id.  If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Claimant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Claimant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Claimant filed an October 2022 VA Form 22-1990 application to receive Chapter 33 education assistance benefits.  Later that month, the RO denied the Claimant's application stating he was not eligible for Chapter 33 benefits as he had insufficient qualifying active duty service.  This appeal ensued.

The Claimant argues that he enlisted with the National Guard in December 2020 and has served continuously since enlistment, but VA stated he "only served four months."  See October 2022 VA Form 10182.  Thus, the question before the Board is whether the Claimant has any qualifying active duty service that would entitle him to Chapter 33 education benefits.

Eligibility for education benefits under Chapter 33 is based on certain qualifying periods and types of active duty for individuals who served on active duty after September 10, 2001.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3301-3324; see also 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520.

An individual must have served a minimum of 90 aggregate days of active duty excluding active duty for entry level and skill training and, after completion of such service, (1) continued on active duty; (2) was discharged from service with an honorable discharge; (3) was released from service characterized as honorable and placed on the retired list, temporary disability retired list, or transferred to the Fleet Reserve or the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve; (4) was released from service characterized as honorable for further service in a reserve component; or (5) was discharged or released from service for a medical condition that preexisted such service and is not determined to be service connected; hardship, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned; or a physical or mental condition that interfered with the individual's performance of duty but was not characterized as a disability and did not result from the individual's own misconduct.  38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(a) (emphasis added).

Here, the Claimant has been enlisted with the National Guard since December 2020.  See November 2021 Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense Identity Repository (VADIR) Information Report.  The record reflects the Claimant served on active duty for entry level and skill training from May 3, 2021 to September 29, 2021.  Id.  The Board notes that the VADIR database is an electronic repository of military personnel's service history, payroll information and their dependents' data provided to VA by the Department of Defense (DoD), and that, generally, the Board is bound by DoD findings.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.203(a) (2017); Duro v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 530, 532 (1992).  The Claimant's initial period of active duty for training is not considered qualifying active duty for Chapter 33 as it is active duty for entry level and skill training until he completes 24 months of qualifying active duty service.

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 3301(1)(A), qualifying active duty service for members of the regular components of the Armed Forces is full time duty other than active duty for training (ACDUTRA).  For members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces, qualifying active duty includes service on active duty under a call or order to active duty under section 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304 of title 10 or section 712 of title 14.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3301(1)(B).

For members of the National Guard of the United States, in addition to service described above for members of the regular and reserve components of the Armed Forces, qualifying active duty includes full-time service (i) in the National Guard of a State for the purpose of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the National Guard; or (ii) in the National Guard under section 502(f) of title 32 when authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense for the purpose of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and supported by Federal funds.  38 U.S.C. § 3301(1)(C).  Any other service does not qualify as active duty service for Chapter 33 benefits purposes.

In this case, the Board finds that the Claimant did not serve a minimum of 90 aggregate days of qualifying active duty excluding entry level and skill training.

Specifically, the Claimant's VADIR Information Report shows that the Claimant's service from May 2021 to September 2021 was his initial period of active duty for training, which is not considered qualifying active duty for Chapter 33 as it is active duty for entry level and skill training until he completes 24 months of qualifying active duty service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(a).

The Claimant does not contend he served on fulltime active duty with the regular components of the Armed Forces, or that he served on active duty under a call or order to active duty under Section 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304 of Title 10 or Section 712 of Title 14.  The record also does not reflect such qualifying service.  Additionally, the Claimant does not contend, and the VADIR Information Report does not reflect any periods of qualifying active duty pursuant to section 502(f) of title 32, or that he was on duty performing such tasks as organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the National Guard.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3301(1)(C).  Overall, the Claimant has no qualifying active duty service for basic entitlement to Chapter 33 benefits.

As noted above, service department findings are binding on VA for purposes of establishing the length and character of an individual's service.  VA does not have the authority to alter the findings of the service department.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.203(a); see also Spencer v. West, 13 Vet. App. 376, 380 (2000).  The Board is bound by the findings reflected in the Claimant's service personnel and DoD records, which are reflected in the November 2021VADIR Information Report.  Because the Claimant only had initial active duty for training service from May 2021 to September 2021, which is not qualifying service for Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance benefits, he did not serve 90 aggregate days of active duty.  See 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(a).

The Board notes that an individual will also be eligible for Chapter 33 benefits if they served a minimum of 30 continuous days on active duty and, after completion of such service, were discharged or released from active duty under other than dishonorable conditions due to a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(b).  However, as the Claimant has not been discharged from service and does not contend such an exception applies to him, he also does not qualify for Chapter 33 benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(b).

The Board is grateful for the Claimant's service and notes he may qualify for, apply to, and receive Chapter 33 education benefits in the future, so long as his service meets any of the qualifying active duty service discussed above.  Unfortunately, entitlement to Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance benefits are prefaced on specific and unambiguous legal requirements, which have not been met in this Claimant's case.  As the disposition of this matter is based on the law, and not the facts of the case, the Claimant's appeal must be denied.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).  Where the law, rather than the facts, is dispositive, the benefit-of-the-doubt provisions as set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) do not apply.
