ORDER

The rating reduction for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with Baker's cyst disability from 30 percent to a 10 percent rating was not proper and the 30 percent rating is restored, effective June 1, 2023.

Service connection for migraine headaches is granted.

Service connection for a low back condition (claimed as right lower extremity sciatica) is granted.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for right knee patellofemoral syndrome is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) disability is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia disability is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for an intestinal condition to include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and diverticulosis is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At the time of the February 2023 rating decision, which reduced the rating for the Veteran's right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with Baker's cyst disability, the evidence did not show that improvement of the service-connected disability would be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life.

2. The Veteran's migraine headaches disability is caused by his service connected tinnitus disability.

3. The Veteran's low back condition is caused by his service connected right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with Baker's cyst disability.

4. The Veteran's right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with Baker's cyst disability is rated as 30 percent disabling, which is the maximum schedular rating permitted for limitation of flexion of the knee.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The reduction in the schedular rating for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with Baker's cyst disability was improper, and the criteria for restoration of a 30 percent rating are met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 3.321, 3.344, 4.1.

2. The criteria for service connection for migraine headaches have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

3. The criteria for service connection for a low back condition have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

4. The criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for right knee patellofemoral syndrome with Baker's cyst disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from June 2007 to February 2008. The Board recognizes the Veteran's service to his country and the sacrifices it entailed. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denying service connection for migraine headaches, and sciatica; an October 2023 rating decision denying service connection for GERD, IBS, and fibromyalgia; and an October 2023 rating decision finding the rating reduction of the Veteran's service connected right knee patellofemoral syndrome with Baker's cyst disability was proper.

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 and October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of GERD, fibromyalgia, and IBS, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

While the Veteran initially filed a claim of service connection for sciatica, to address the Veteran's claim more fully, the Board has recharacterized his sciatica claim as one for a low back condition. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009). Similarly, the Board has recharacterized the Veteran's claim for IBS as one for an intestinal condition to include IBS and diverticulosis.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a current disability resulting from a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) a current disability exists and (2) the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc).

Notably, when analyzing a claim for secondary service connection, the legal threshold for establishing the causal nexus between the service-connected primary disability and the claimed secondary disability is simple "but-for" causation, a broad standard that allows for multiple causes. Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

Similarly, but-for causation may involve intermediary steps between the primary and secondary disabilities. Intermediary steps may be medical conditions that do not qualify on their own as VA disabilities, such as obesity (e.g., if a service-connected back injury prevents the veteran from exercising, resulting in weight gain that causes or aggravates a foot disability), as well as medications and treatments for the primary disability (e.g., if painkillers prescribed for service-connected headaches cause or aggravate a liver disability). See, e.g., Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 307 (2020); Garner v. Tran, 33 Vet. App. 241, 247-48 (2021); Spicer, 61 F.4th at 1365-1366.

1. The rating reduction for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with Baker's cyst disability from a 30 percent to a 10 percent rating was not proper and the 30 percent rating is restored.

The Veteran contends the rating reduction of his right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with Baker's cyst disability from 30 percent to 10 percent is unwarranted because his symptoms have not improved. See June 2023 VA Form 20-0996.

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) allow for the reduction in evaluation of a service-connected disability when warranted by the evidence, but only after following certain procedural guidelines.

The RO must issue a rating action proposing the reduction and setting forth all material facts and reasons for the reduction. The veteran must then be given 60 days to submit additional evidence and 30 days to request a predetermination hearing.

If a timely request for a predetermination hearing is received, VA will notify the beneficiary in writing of the time and place of the hearing at least 10 days in advance of the scheduled hearing date. The hearing will be conducted by VA personnel who did not participate in the proposed adverse action and who will bear the decision-making responsibility. Then a rating action will be taken to effectuate the reduction. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e). The effective date of the reduction will be the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the veteran of the final action expires. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e), (i)(2)(i).

Here, the proper procedures were followed in implementing the reduction. The Veteran was notified of the proposed reduction for his service-connected right knee disability via a September 2022 rating decision and associated correspondence sent in the same month. The actual reduction was subsequently effectuated by a February 2023 rating decision and associated correspondence sent in the same month, with an effective date of June 1, 2023. The June 1, 2023, effectuation date meets the required 60-day period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e), (i)(2)(i).

Having determined that the procedural requirements under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) were followed, the critical question, then, becomes whether the reduction in rating was proper based on the evidence of record.

After review of the lay and medical evidence of record, the Board finds that although the Veteran has demonstrated some improvement in his right knee disability symptomatology, the evidence of record does not indicate a reasonable certainty that the improvement would be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life.

A rating reduction is proper if the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability. The examination reports reflecting such change must be based upon thorough examinations. Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420 (1993). The evidence must reflect an actual change in the veteran's condition and not merely a difference in the thoroughness of the examination or in the use of descriptive terms. 38 C.F.R. § 4.13.

Thus, in any rating-reduction case not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred but also that that improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.10; Brown, supra.

The Veteran's right knee patellofemoral syndrome is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260, for limitation of flexion of the leg.  

Under Diagnostic Code 5260, a noncompensable rating is warranted for flexion limited to 60 degrees. A 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 15 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.

Here, the RO noted improvement in the Veteran's right knee symptoms when comparing the Veteran's symptoms from the May 2022 and February 2023 VA examinations and the November 2020 VA examination that established the 30 percent disability rating.

There were indeed indications of improvement in some areas when compared to the previous VA examination in November 2020.

 For instance, the 2020 exam indicates with repeated use over time flexion from zero to 5 degrees. During the May 2022 VA examination, the Veteran had normal range of motion with repeated use over time. During the February 2023 VA examination flexion was to 130 degrees and extension was to zero degrees with repeated use over time. See November 2020 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ); May 2022 DBQ; February 2023 DBQ.

Thus, it is clear that when comparing the Veteran's symptoms with repeated use over time from the 2020 VA examination with May 2022 and February 2023 VA examinations, there has been improvement in symptoms.

However, while the RO noted improvement in the Veteran's right knee disability, it analyzed the reduction of the 30 percent rating just as it would a claim for an increased rating, by focusing on what the evidence must show for specific rating percentages rather than discussing any overall improvement of the Veteran's service-connected disability and whether such improvement will be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life. Importantly, here, sustained improvement was not confirmed.

During the November 2020 VA examination, the Veteran reported symptoms of joint pain, crackling when walking, swelling, and joint locking. During the May 2022 VA examination, Veteran reported symptoms that were similar, if not worse. The Veteran reported ongoing throbbing deep pain in the right knee, occasional stiffness, limitation of motion, and that his right knee locks at times lasting for as long as five to six minutes. The Veteran further reported that his right knee impacts his ability to walk for long distances, stand for long periods, climb stairs, bend, squat, jump and run. During the February 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported symptoms of swelling pain and burning, which make it difficult to flex his leg, climb stairs, or run. See November 2022 DBQ; May 2022 DBQ; February 2023 DBQ.

The Board is sensitive to the need to "stay in its lane," and avoid substituting its own medical judgement for that of qualified experts. See, e.g., Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012). 

The process of adjudication is simplified by the benefit of the doubt rule, which compels the Secretary to resolve reasonable doubt as to any material issue in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. For purposes of that regulation, "reasonable doubt" exists when the evidence does not "satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim." Id. This definition of "reasonable doubt" is consistent with the statutory version of the benefit of the doubt rule, which applies when there is even an "approximate balance of positive and negative evidence." 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). This is a unique and intentionally generous standard of proof in American jurisprudence, created in recognition of the nation's great debt to its veterans. Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014).

Here, after considering all the evidence and giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that while the May 2022 and February 2023 VA examinations show some improvement in range of motion, they do not support a finding that the Veteran's symptoms have improved under the ordinary conditions of life.

The burden to justify a reduction in disability rating is on VA and VA must comply with applicable standards. See Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413 (1993) (VA is required to establish, that it is in compliance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.344, that a rating reduction is warranted.); See also Kitchens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 320 (1995). Here, that burden has not been met.

Therefore, the Board finds the rating reduction is void ab initio and a restoration of the 30 percent rating should be restored effective June 1, 2023.

2. Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is granted.

The Veteran contends that his migraine headaches are related to service. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his migraine headaches are secondary to his service connected tinnitus disability. See October 2022 VA Form 10182.

Here, the RO conceded the Veteran has a current disability of migraine headaches in the January 2023 rating decision. The Veteran is also service connected for tinnitus disability.

Therefore, the question now before the Board is whether the Veteran's migraine disability resulted from his service connected tinnitus disability.

As such, the crux of the question before the Board is whether it is approximately as likely as not the Veteran would no longer have migraines if his service-connected tinnitus disability were somehow eliminated from the analysis or if without the tinnitus disability, the migraine disability would be less severe.

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds the Veteran's migraine headaches disability resulted from his service connected tinnitus disability.

In November 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. The examiner concluded there is no medical literature to support causation of headaches due to tinnitus and hence, a secondary nexus cannot be established and the veteran's claimed migraine, is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the veteran's tinnitus. The examiner explained that with respect to symptom onset, more patients reported that headache onset preceded tinnitus rather than the opposite. However, headaches and tinnitus are linked via common pathophysiological mechanisms. See November 2022 DBQ. 

This opinion is problematic in that the examiner applied the wrong legal standard to the issue of secondary service connection. As discussed above, secondary service connection allows for multiple causes of a harm. Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1363-64 (Fed. Cir. 2023). In other words, applying a "but for" standard dictates that secondary service connection may be established by indirect correlation.

The Board considered remanding this case for an additional medical examination to specifically address this issue, as the Board is wary of invading the province of scientific or medical experts. See, e.g., Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991). However, determining whether service connection applies in a particular case is a finding of fact, not a medical diagnosis. See, e.g., Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 191 (1991). Thus, when the question of whether a disability is service connected is on appeal, providing the answer is the exclusive province of the Board. See, e.g., Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995).

As a result, if after reviewing the record as a whole and, if appropriate, applying the benefit of the doubt doctrine the Board can find service connection, no additional evidence is necessary-service connection is warranted, and the appeal is granted.

Here, although the November 2022 VA examiner provided a negative nexus opinion, the examiner also noted that headaches and tinnitus are linked via common pathophysiological mechanisms. The examiner also noted that in some cases that tinnitus precedes onset of headaches. See November 2022 DBQ.

Thus, after applying the intentionally generous benefit of the doubt doctrine, the Board finds that based on the Veteran's lay statements and the November 2022 VA examiner's report, there is sufficient evidence to conclude the Veteran's migraine headaches disability is secondary to his service-connected tinnitus disability. 

Accordingly, for the reasons previously discussed, the Board finds the evidence therefore establishes service connection is warranted for a migraine disability. This appeal is granted.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a low back condition (claimed as right lower extremity sciatica) is granted.

The Veteran contends that his low back condition is related to service. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his low back condition is secondary to his service connected right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with Baker's cyst. See October 2022 VA Form 10182. 

Here, in the November 2022 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with a lumbosacral strain. The Veteran is also service connected for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with Baker's cyst disability.

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds the Veteran's low back condition resulted from his service connected right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with Baker's cyst disability.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2022. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's claimed sciatica diagnosed as lumbosacral strain is at least as likely as not proximately due to or the result of the veteran's patellofemoral pain syndrome with osteoarthritis right knee with baker's cyst. The examiner explained that degenerative changes of the knee often cause loss of extension. This may affect aspects of posture such as lumbar lordosis. Lumbar lordosis was significantly reduced in patients whose limitation of extension of the knee was more than 5 degrees. This study indicates that symptoms from the lumbar spine may be caused by degenerative changes in the knee. See November 2022 DBQ.

The Board finds this opinion is highly probative because it is based on a review of the record and contains clear conclusions with supporting data connected by a reasoned medical explanation. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301-02 (2008). 

Thus, there is a persuasive opinion in favor of the Veteran's claim, and no adequate medical opinions against it. The Board finds the evidence therefore establishes service connection is warranted for a low back condition. Accordingly, the Board grants service connection for a low back condition as secondary to the Veteran's service connected right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with Baker's cyst disability.

4. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for right knee patellofemoral syndrome denied.

The Veteran seeks a higher rating for his service-connected right knee patellofemoral syndrome. Specifically, the Veteran contends that he is receiving injections in his right knee and can barely move without the injections. See October 2023 HLR informal conference. 

The Veteran's right knee patellofemoral syndrome is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260, for limitation of flexion of the leg. Limitation of motion of the knee is rated under Diagnostic Code 5260 and Diagnostic Code 5261 (limitation of extension).

Under Diagnostic Code 5260, a noncompensable rating is warranted for flexion limited to 60 degrees. A 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 15 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.

Under Diagnostic Code 5261, extension limited to 5 degrees is rated zero percent. The criterion for a 10 percent rating is extension limited to 10 degrees. The criterion for the next higher rating, 20 percent, is extension limited to 15 degrees. The criterion for the next higher rating, 30 percent, is extension limited to 20 degrees. A 40 percent rating is assigned with extension limited to 30 degrees. The highest 50 percent rating is assigned with extension limited to 45 degrees.

Normal knee motion is from zero degrees of extension to 140 degrees of flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

The Board has reviewed all relevant evidence, to include lay statements and the VA medical records, with particular attention to the VA examinations from May 2022 and February 2023.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2022. The Veteran reported ongoing symptoms of throbbing deep pain in the right knee with occasional stiffness. He also reported locking in the right knee that at times last five to six minutes. On examination, flexion endpoint was to 120 degrees during flare-ups and extension endpoint was to zero degrees. There was no evidence of crepitus, ankylosis, impairment of the tibia or fibula, impairment of the genu recurvatum, or muscle atrophy. The Veteran denied a history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the knee. The Veteran also denied a history of frequent effusion of the knee. See May 2022 DBQ.

In February 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination. The Veteran reported symptoms of swelling, pain, and burning which impact his ability to flex his leg, climb stairs, and run. On examination, flexion endpoint was to 110 degrees during flare-ups and extension endpoint was to zero degrees. There was no evidence of crepitus, ankylosis, impairment of the tibia or fibula, impairment of the genu recurvatum, or muscle atrophy. The Veteran denied a history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the knee. The Veteran also denied a history of frequent effusion of the knee. See February 2023 DBQ.

As the Veteran is in receipt of the highest schedular rating for limitation of flexion of the leg under diagnostic code 5260, there is no basis to award a higher evaluation.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the knee and leg. Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment).  

However, there is no lay or medical evidence showing the Veteran's right knee disability has manifested by ankylosis, recurrent subluxation or lateral instability, meniscal conditions, limitation of extension greater than zero degrees, impairment of the tibia or fibula, or genu recurvatum at any time during the appeal period. Therefore, Diagnostic codes 5256, 5257, 5258, 5259, 5261, 5262, and 5263 are not applicable in this case.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 30 percent for right knee patellofemoral syndrome. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 30 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for GERD is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his GERD and fibromyalgia disabilities are related to service. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his GERD and fibromyalgia are secondary to his service-connected patellofemoral pain syndrome with right knee Baker's cyst to include NSAID use for the knee. See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

The Board regrets the delay but finds remand is necessary to properly adjudicate the Veteran's claim.

In the present case, the Veteran has a current disability. Treatment notes show a diagnosis of GERD and the Veteran's doctor provided a statement indicating the Veteran has symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia. See July 2023 Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility; August 2023 Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility. The Veteran is also service connected for a right knee disability. Thus, it was a pre-decisional duty to assist error to not obtain a medical opinion to address the relationship between the Veteran's current disability of GERD and fibromyalgia and his service-connected right knee disability to include the use of NSAIDS to treat these disabilities. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-86 (2006). See also 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).

Accordingly, the Board finds remand is warranted.

3. Entitlement to service connection for an intestinal condition to include IBS and diverticulosis is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his IBS disability is related to service. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his IBS disability is secondary to NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and Naproxen used to treat his service-connected right knee patellofemoral syndrome with Baker's cyst. See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

The Board regrets the delay but finds remand is necessary to properly adjudicate the Veteran's claim.

In general, service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is the result of a service-connected disease or injury. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). 

Here, the Veteran has a current disability. The Veteran's treating provider noted a diagnosis of IBS. See July 2023 Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran does not have diagnosis of IBS but diagnosed the Veteran with diverticulosis. See July 2023 DBQ. The Veteran is also service connected for a right knee disability.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2023 to determine if there is a nexus between his current disability and his service connected disability. See July 2023 DBQ. However, the Board finds that this opinion is inadequate because the examiner did not address aggravation. See Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74, 89-91 (2018) (separate findings and rationale should be provided for causation and aggravation).

When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).

The failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and therefore, remand is warranted.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature, onset, and etiology of his GERD, fibromyalgia, and intestinal condition to include IBS and diverticulosis disabilities. 

2. The examiner should review the claim file, including this remand, lay statements, VA treatment records, service treatment records, and private treatment records.

3. For the Veteran's intestinal condition to include IBS and diverticulosis, the examiner must identify each disability.

4. For each disability (GERD, fibromyalgia, and intestinal condition to include IBS and diverticulosis), the examiner must opine as to the following:

(a.) Whether it is at least approximately as likely as not the disability was caused by his service-connected right knee patellofemoral syndrome with Baker's cyst disability.

(b.) If "no" to paragraph (a.), whether it is at least approximately as likely as not that the disability was aggravated (i.e., made worse)) by the Veterans service-connected right knee patellofemoral syndrome with Baker's cyst disability. This aggravation opinion must be separate from the "caused by" opinion.

The examiner must also consider the possibility of intermediate steps such as medication, or treatment causally related to a service-connected disability that in turn caused or aggravated the Veteran's disabilities.

5. All opinions, findings and conclusions must take into account the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine, which means the VA must find in favor of the Veteran when positive evidence is at least "approximately balanced" with or "nearly equal" to the negative evidence on any material issue.

6. If any of the requested opinions or responses cannot be provided without resorting to speculation, the examiner must explain why this is so.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
