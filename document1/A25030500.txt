ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of a finding that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss had its onset during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1953 to August 1957.

In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is granted.

The Veteran contends that his bilateral hearing loss had its onset during active service with the US Coast Guard. Specifically, the Veteran contends that hazardous noise exposure without hearing protection and chronic ear infections caused by rescue missions while on board the USCGC Boutwell caused his bilateral hearing loss. 

Service connection is awarded for disability that is the result of a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Some chronic diseases, including organic diseases of the nervous system like sensorineural hearing loss, may be presumed to have been incurred in service, if they become manifest to a degree of ten percent or more within the applicable presumptive period. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101(3), 1112(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a), 3.309(a). For those listed chronic conditions, a showing of continuity of symptoms affords an alternative route to service connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The applicable presumptive period is one year from separation.

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability that are subject to lay observation. 38 U.S.C. § 1153(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

Turning to the current appeal, the March 2024 Rating Decision made the favorable finding that the Veteran has a diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's reports of hazardous noise exposure are consistent with the facts and circumstances of his service and the evidence of record. The Veteran reports military noise exposure the ship engines, tools, and machinery, and states that he did not have hearing protection.  The Veteran's military personnel record (MPR) shows that he received small arms training and that he received a commendation as "a member of the permanent range detail for annual small arms training."  See MPR, page 7, June 28, 1957.  Therefore, the Board concedes that the Veteran sustained military acoustic trauma while in active service.  

The Veteran underwent VA examinations in September 2023 and in March 2024 with the same examiner. The VA examiner's rationale is identical in each opinion. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally but opined that the disability was less likely than not due to military noise exposure. The examiner stated that due to missing of incomplete entry/exit audiograms, she could not verify a threshold shift in the Veteran's medical records. She stated that the Veteran's STRs "are silent for hearing loss" and that his first report of hearing 

?

loss on file . . . "would make the onset of hearing loss over 50 years post separation." She noted the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) as a Yeoman, stating that it has a "low MOS rank for hazardous noise exposure." 

The Board finds that the VA medical opinions are not adequate for adjudication purposes. The VA examiner did not address the Veteran's STRs showing that he had a diagnosis of chronic ear infections during service. See STRs, pages 39 and 145, September 5, 1956.  She also failed to give appropriate consideration to the Veteran's lay statements regarding onset and continuity of his decreased hearing acuity.  In January 2024, the Veteran wrote, "when the ship received a distress call of a disabled vessel... it did not make any difference if it was freezing rain, high winds. heavy seas or in the middle of the night, the ship had to go on the rescue mission. On many of the ships rescue missions and the weather was bad, when the ship returned to home port, I would have to for two to three days hitting the ear drop bottle and taking pain medication from the ship's corpsman due to ear infections. When I enlisted into the Coast Guard my hearing was rated as good, upon leaving my hearing was rated as poor."

With his March 2025 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran submitted another lay statement. In this statement, the Veteran asserts that "if my entire request had been read and reviewed they would have seen that the cause was many events connected to being on a Coast Guard patrol and rescue vessel" and "I know that the information that was in my initial letter [of January 2024] is 100% correct and true for I have had to wear hearing aids from the time I left the Coast Guard to present day . . ." 

The Veteran has reported that he first experienced symptoms of decreased hearing acuity while he was in active service, and that those symptoms have continued since that time. The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report when he 

?

first experience symptoms decreased hearing acuity, and that the symptoms have continued since service. Moreover, the Board finds that the Veteran is credible in that respect. Heuer v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 379 (1995); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398 (1995); Caldwell v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 466 (1991). 

The examiner relied on the absence of evidence of hearing loss in the Veteran's records to conclude that the Veteran's hearing loss was less likely than not due to noise exposure in service. An opinion based on the absence of a disability in service, such as this one, is inadequate and therefore the Board assigns it no probative weight. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993).

The Board notes that lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. In fact, competent medical evidence is not necessarily required when the determinative issue involves either medical etiology or a medical diagnosis. Jandreau v. Nicholson,492 F.3d 1372(Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson,451 F.3d 1331(Fed. Cir. 2006). As noted above, the Veteran is competent to identify reduced hearing acuity, and report on the chronicity of symptomatology since active service. Moreover, his statements have been found credible.

In sum, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss disability for VA purposes. The Veteran has competently and credibly reported that he first experienced hearing loss while in active service and that he has continued to have symptoms since that time. While there is a VA medical opinion of record against the claim, that opinion is not adequate.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the approximate balance of the evidence is for the claim, and entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
