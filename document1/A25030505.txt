ORDER

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as depression, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran has had a psychiatric disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from January 2018 to September 2022.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In a March 2024 VA form 10182 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran appealed this decision and elected the direct review docket. By selecting the direct review docket, the Board must base its decision on the evidence that was before the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of the May 2023 initial decision which was subsequently subject to higher-level review in the October 2023 decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a mental health disorder has been recharacterized as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depression, in accordance with Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

Service connection for depression is denied. 

A veteran is entitled to VA disability compensation if there is a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131. Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. In other words, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant. U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328 (1997). In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The Veteran reports no mental health disorders or mental health treatment prior to entering the military. In December 2018 while on active duty the Veteran sought help from the substance abuse rehabilitation program (SARP) at NMC San Diego. He reported a one year history of moderate depressive symptoms, including anhedonia, depressed mood, sleep disturbance, fatigue, negative self-beliefs, difficulty concentrating, psychomotor changes, and moderate anxiety symptoms, along with uncontrollable worry. He was found to have an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. He underwent therapy for this and an alcohol use disorder intermittently over the next 4 years. 

To establish entitlement to the benefits sought, the Veteran underwent a VA mental health examination in April 2023. The Veteran was evaluated by a psychologist and determined to have no psychiatric diagnoses that correspond to DSM-5 criteria. The Veteran had just broken up with his girlfriend and reported that he felt sad and lonely at times due to familial strain with his father, but he does not meet the criteria for any depressive disorder. He has not been suicidal, homicidal, psychotic, manic, hypomanic, obsessive, or compulsive. He has no eating disorders. He was not currently seeing a mental health provider or receiving psychotropic medication. The VA psychologic examiner went on to give rationale that a mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. He concluded that the Veteran did not have a diagnosable mental health disorder, by DSM-5 criteria.

The Board finds the examiner's opinion probative because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides a persuasive explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

The Board has considered the Veteran's statements that he has a mental health disorder. While he is competent to report his experienced or observed symptoms, he is not competent to provide a medical diagnosis of a mental health disorder meeting DSM-5 criteria. Psychological disabilities are medically complex, and providing diagnoses requires specialized education, training, or experience that the Veteran is not shown to have. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). Moreover, a valid DSM-5 diagnosis is required to warrant compensation for a mental health condition. Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393 (2020).

The Board would like to point out to the Veteran that in the October 2023 rating decision that is on appeal here, the RO conceded that the complaints of depression while still in service would be conceded to be a qualifying event for a mental health diagnosis, a favorable finding which, if a mental health diagnosis were present, could potentially link it to service connection. The Veteran would be advised if he seeks mental health services in the future and is found to have a mental health diagnosis that meets DSM-5 criteria and was present while he was in service, he may wish to file a supplemental claim and have the question readjudicated with the known diagnosis. Again, we will leave instructions on how to file a supplemental claim with this decision.

In sum, the record does not demonstrate a current psychiatric disorder. In the absence of a current medical diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder during or approximate to the pendency of the claim, service connection cannot be granted. Brammer at 225. As the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107. Accordingly, the claim is denied.
