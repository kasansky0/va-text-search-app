ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for ovarian condition, to include heavy bleeding and abdominal pains, is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for endometriosis, with heavy bleeding and abdominal pains, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. It is not reasonably shown that the Veteran has a current disability of an ovarian condition, to include heavy bleeding and abdominal pains.

2. It is not reasonably shown that the Veteran has a current disability of endometriosis with heavy bleeding and abdominal pains.

3. The weight of the probative evidence persuasively favors a finding that all contended symptoms are duplicative of the symptoms already compensated for under the service-connected disability of total hysterectomy with BSO.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for ovarian condition, to include heavy bleeding and abdominal pains, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7699-7615.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for endometriosis, with heavy bleeding and abdominal pains, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, DC 7629. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2004 to June 2006.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for ovarian condition, to include heavy bleeding and abdominal pains, is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for endometriosis, with heavy bleeding and abdominal pains, is denied.

The Veteran contends that her endometriosis and ovarian conditions, both accompanied by heavy bleeding and abdominal pain, are related to active-duty service. See June 2024, VA Form 10182. The Veteran contends the strenuous work she completed during service agitated her symptoms of endometriosis. Id. In a July 2024, Informal Hearing Presentation, the Veteran's representative argued that the Veteran had ovarian cysts while on active duty in the Army. They were very painful; and abdominal pain at times prevented her from doing her regular daily activities. This pain was unbearable at times.

In the May 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ denied the claims because there was no current diagnosis of an ovarian condition or endometriosis; and the conditions were shown to be resolved. The AOJ favorably found that the STRs showed a history of ovarian cysts and complaints of abdominal pains during service. The Board will not disturb a favorable finding. Accordingly, the primary question before the Board is whether the Veteran has a currently diagnosed disability.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of (1) a current disability (for which service connection is sought); (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a causal connection between the disease or injury in service and the current disability. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 under the following circumstances: (1) where a chronic disease or injury is shown in service and subsequent manifestations for the same disease or injury are shown at a later date unless clearly attributable to an intercurrent cause; or (2) where there is continuity of symptomatology since service; or (3) by showing that the disorder manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of the date of separation from service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant. Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give benefit of the doubt to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Further, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the evidence is not in approximate balance and, therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Turning to the evidence, the service treatment records (STRs) show that in 2005, the Veteran suffered from a left ovarian cyst. A June 2006 separation examination shows a history of ovarian cysts, treatment for gynecological disorders, and a laparoscopy for an ovarian cyst. The STRs also note a history of pelvic pain, urinary tract infections, and a yeast infection.

VA treatment records from 2011 through 2013 show the Veteran suffered from a heavy- and painful menstrual cycles, a lot of cramping, a possible ruptured cyst, and chronic pain with intercourse.

The August 2020 private treatment records show the Veteran had a history of endometriosis, ovarian cysts, dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), endometriosis, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea. In August 2020, the Veteran underwent a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). This included the removal of the uterus, cervix, ovaries, and bilateral fallopian tubes. Post-operatively, no endometriosis lesions were noted; and pelvic anatomy was grossly normal.

The Board notes that the Veteran is currently service connected for a total hysterectomy with BSO.

In a May 2024 VA gynecological conditions disability benefits questionnaire, the examiner indicated the Veteran was diagnosed with endometriosis in 2015 and with ovarian cysts in 2004. The Veteran reported that she was injured during a ruck march and hand-to-hand combat. Symptoms of bleeding, abdominal pain, and swelling began in 2004. The Veteran reported that she had several treatments including laparoscopy, pap smears, cervical exams external exams, biopsies, tubal ligation, and a full hysterectomy. The Veteran reported the history of her symptoms as menopause due to the hysterectomy, zero intimacy with her spouse, a lack of libido, dryness, swelling, numbing pain at surgical sites, depression due to two miscarriages, and not being able to have biological children. The pain, bleeding, and discomfort prevented working days and intimacy with her spouse. Currently, the Veteran has menopausal symptoms for which she is taking estrogen therapy.

The examiner noted the Veteran had a hysterectomy and the complete removal of both ovaries. There are no other gynecological conditions. The examiner remarked that, for the claimed ovarian condition and endometriosis, there is no diagnosis because the conditions have resolved. The Board finds the VA examination is adequate and significantly probative on the issue of whether the Veteran has a current disability for VA purposes.

A threshold requirement for substantiating a claim of service connection is there must be competent evidence of the disability for which service connection is sought. Here, there is no competent evidence that the Veteran has, or had at any time during the pendency of the instant claims an ovarian condition or endometriosis disability. No medical provider diagnosed any such disability after the Veteran had her hysterectomy. These issues, as set forth by the VA examiner, were resolved.

However, the Board recognizes that in Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), the Federal Circuit held that "pain alone can service as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability." The medical evidence does not show any complaint, treatment, or diagnosis related to ovarian conditions or endometriosis pain during the period on appeal. As there is no competent evidence that, during the period on appeal, the Veteran has an ovarian condition or endometriosis disability to include one caused by pain that results in functional impairment, she has not presented a valid claim of service connection. See 38 U.S.C. § 1131, 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; see also Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

The Board finds there is a lack of medical evidence of record that would indicate or establish that the Veteran has a current, diagnosed ovarian condition or endometriosis disability; thus, there is no current disability for VA purposes.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that, "Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability. In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim." Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); see also Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143-44 (1992). To be current, a disability must be present near or at the time a claim is filed or at any time during its pendency. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

Accordingly, because a current disability is the cornerstone of service connection, and there is no current diagnosis of an ovarian condition or endometriosis disability or other gynecological disease, the claim for service connection must be denied. See Brammer, supra; see also Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997).

Notwithstanding the fact that the Veteran does not have a currently diagnosed disability, consideration has also been given to the potential application of the other diagnostic codes governing gynecological disabilities. The Veteran's symptoms (cystic ovaries, endometriosis, heavy bleeding, and abdominal pain) began during active service and continued after service; eventually, a total hysterectomy was necessary to resolve the conditions. However, the Board finds no basis upon which to assign additional ratings, at any point, during the period of appeal, as the record contains no evidence of a current disability. 

The Board further notes that, for the entire period on appeal, the Veteran has been awarded special monthly compensation for the loss of use of a creative organ, effective June 22, 2023. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a). Furthermore, as previously discussed, the Veteran was awarded service connection for her total hysterectomy. Accordingly, the Board finds that no additional evaluations under separate provisions are warranted in this case. 

Disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are generally rated separately before ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. However, VA is prohibited from pyramiding (rating the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes). 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. When disabilities have duplicative or overlapping symptoms, the rule against pyramiding prohibits VA from compensating the Veteran more than once for the same symptom or impairment. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017). An August 2024 rating decision awarded the Veteran service connection for total hysterectomy with BSO (claimed as hysterectomy), under 7619, rated at 30 percent disabling, effective June 22, 2023.

The rule against pyramiding prohibits assigning a compensable rating for the Veteran's symptoms more than once. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. To assign a rating for the ovarian condition, endometriosis, and other symptoms that led to the hysterectomy would violate the rule against pyramiding. See Esteban, 6 Vet. App. at 261-62; Lyles, 29 Vet. App. at 107. There are no other symptoms or diagnoses which warrant a compensable rating.

Because the Veteran does not have a currently diagnosed ovarian condition or endometriosis disability, the claims must be denied.
