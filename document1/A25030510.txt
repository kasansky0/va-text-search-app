DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

An earlier effective date of July 19, 2018, for a total disability rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability due to service connected disabilities (TDIU) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Following a July 19, 2018 Intent to File, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received a July 20, 2018 claim for increased disability rating for the service connected spondylosis L5 with L4-L5 foraminal stenosis status post laminectomy and lumbar fusion (back disability).

2. The issue of entitlement to a TDIU was reasonable raised by the record prior to the issuance of the September 2018 rating decision addressing the increased rating claim.

3. The issue of entitlement to a TDIU remained unadjudicated until an April 2024 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision granting entitlement to a TDIU, effective December 8, 2023.

4. From July 19, 2018, the Veteran was unable to maintain substantially gainful employment as a result of service connected disabilities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of July 19, 2018 for a TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 3.340, 3.341, 3.400, 4.15, 4.16, 4.18, 4.19, 4.25.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant, had active service from November 1990 to January 1998.

The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), creates a new framework of review for appellants disagreeing with the AOJ's decision on a claim.

Following an August 2024 VA Regional Office (RO) rating decision denying an earlier effective date for a TDIU, the Veteran submitted an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), appealing the denial.  The NOD requested direct review by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  Direct review is the appeal option to the Board in which a Board decision is issued based on evidence of record at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a hearing or accept into the record additional evidence in its direct review.

An appellant is presumed to be seeking the maximum possible benefit for the rating appealed.  See A.B. v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993).  In A.B., the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) recognized that a claimant may limit the claim or appeal to the issue of entitlement to a particular disability rating which is less than the maximum allowed by law for a particular service connected disability.  Id. at 39.  

In an April 2024 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Veteran explicitly requested a TDIU effective date from the date of erroneous reduction of the back disability (this erroneous reduction was reversed by the Board in an August 2023 decision).  Such erroneous reduction occurred in a September 2018 VA rating decision, which stemmed from a July 19, 2018 Intent to File.  As such, the Board finds that the Veteran is explicitly seeking a TDIU from the July 19, 2018 date of Intent to File for an increased disability rating for the back disability.  In the instant decision the Board grants entitlement to a TDIU from July 19, 2018; therefore, the instant decision is a complete grant as to the issue on appeal.  

The Board is cognizant that in Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that, generally, the Board should not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an AMA docket switch has elapsed.  For the reasons discussed above, however, the Board's grant of an earlier effective date of July 19, 2018 for a TDIU is a complete grant as to the sole issue on appeal; therefore, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in the Board proceeding with the instant matter at this time.

TDIU from July 19, 2018 is Granted.

The effective date for an increased rating for disability compensation will be the date entitlement arose or the date of receipt of the claim, whichever is later, with the exception being that the date may be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred if a claim is received within one year from such date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  A TDIU claim is a claim for increased compensation, and the effective date rules for increased compensation apply to a TDIU claim.  See Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).

The Court has held that a TDIU is raised when a veteran: (1) submits evidence of a medical disability; (2) makes a claim for the highest rating possible; and 

(3) submits evidence of unemployability.  See Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Total disability is considered to exist when there is any impairment which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  Total disability may or may not be permanent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(1).  Total ratings are authorized for any disability or combination of disabilities for which the Rating Schedule prescribes a 100 percent evaluation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(2).

TDIU may be assigned when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  The service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue will be addressed in both instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), (b).

If there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, with sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  If a veteran's disabilities do not meet the objective combined rating percentage criteria of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), it then becomes necessary to consider whether the criteria for referral for extraschedular consideration are met under § 4.16(b) criteria.  It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled.  Submission to the Director, Compensation and Pension Service, for extraschedular consideration is warranted in all cases of veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, but who fail to meet the percentage standards set forth in § 4.16(a).  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

Individual unemployability must be determined without regard to any non-service-connected disabilities or a veteran's advancing age.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341(a), 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).  The sole fact that a veteran is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough.  A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment, but the ultimate question is whether a veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether a veteran can find employment.  Id. at 361.  When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in a veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) defined "substantially gainful employment" as an occupation that provides an annual income that exceeds the poverty threshold for one person, irrespective of the number of hours or days that a veteran actually works and without regard to a veteran's earned annual income.  In Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993), the Court held that the central inquiry in determining whether a veteran is entitled to a TDIU is whether a veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability. The determination as to whether a total disability is appropriate should not be based solely upon demonstrated difficulty in obtaining employment in one particular field, which could also potentially be due to external bases such as economic factors, but rather to all reasonably available sources of employment under the circumstances.  See Ferraro v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 326, 331-332 (1991).  

In Ray v. Wilkie, the Court explained that substantially gainful employment contains economic and noneconomic components.  The noneconomic component requires consideration of a veteran's ability to secure or follow that type of employment.  Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  In evaluating a veteran's employability, consideration may be given to the level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to age or impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

The economic component involves considerations around marginal employment.  Ray, 31 Vet. App. at 73.  Marginal employment is not considered substantially gainful employment and generally is deemed to exist when a veteran's earned income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person.  Marginal employment may also be held to exist in certain cases when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold on a facts-found basis.  Consideration shall be given in all claims to the nature of the employment and the reason for termination.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Marginal employment, odd-job employment, and employment at half the usual remuneration is not incompatible with a determination of unemployability if the restriction to securing or retaining better employment is due to disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.17(a).

The term "protected environment" has not been specifically defined by VA.  Until recently, it had not been defined by the courts that review VA decisions.  Most recently, the Court addressed the meaning of the phrase "employment in a protected environment" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  In LaBruzza v. McDonough, the Court defined a "protected environment" as a "lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market."  The Court stated that while the Board may consider ADA accommodations and other individualized factors, such as income, neither are dispositive.  LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024).  The Court indicated that a protected work environment was one where the earned income was above the marginal employment level, but not too far above it, and that it is a very fact specific inquiry.  Id.

The ultimate issue of whether a TDIU should be awarded is not a medical question, but rather is a determination for the adjudicator.  See Moore v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 211, 218 (2007) (ultimate question of whether a veteran is capable of substantial gainful employment is not a medical one; that determination is for the VA adjudicator), rev'd on other grounds sub nom, Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  Although VA must give full consideration, per 38 C.F.R. § 4.15, to "the effect of combinations of disability," VA regulations place responsibility for the ultimate TDIU determination on VA, not a medical examiner's opinion.  See Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013); 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see also Smith v. Shinseki, 647 F.3d 1380, 1385-86 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (VA is not required to obtain an industrial survey from a vocational expert before making a TDIU determination but may choose to do so in an appropriate case).

As discussed in the introduction, the Veteran appeals for an earlier effective date of July 19, 2018 for the grant of a TDIU.  From July 19, 2018, the Veteran was in receipt of a combined schedular disability rating of all disabilities of at least 70 percent, with at least one disability rated as 40 percent or higher (back disability); therefore, the service connected disabilities have met the combined schedular rating percentage criteria for TDIU eligibility under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) from July 19, 2018 forward.

By way of history, on July 19, 2019, VA received an Intent to File from the Veteran.  The very next day, on July 20, 2018, VA received the Veteran's formal claim for benefits.  While the claim form did not explicitly request an increased disability rating for the service-connected back disability, it did request separate compensable disability ratings for the bilateral lower extremities secondary to the service connected back disability.  As such, the AOJ treated this as a claim for an increased disability rating for the back.

During development of the back rating issue, prior to the issuance of the September 2018 rating decision addressing the increased rating claim, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU was reasonably raised by the record pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  Per a September 2015 VA treatment record, the Veteran had been unemployed since undergoing back surgery in September and October of 2014.  It was noted that the Veteran had been released from prior employment due to the back disability symptoms (including the separately compensable radicular symptoms) preventing performance of various employment responsibilities, including standing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, crawling, and lifting up to 75 pounds.  A subsequent January 2016 VA treatment record indicated that the Veteran remained unemployed, at least in part, due to the back (and radicular) disability symptoms.  

In September 2018, the AOJ issued a rating decision, in pertinent part, granting separate compensable disability ratings for the bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and reducing the back rating from 40 percent disabling to 10 percent disabling.  The Veteran appealed the rating reduction, and the 40 percent rating was restored by the Board in an August 2023 rating decision.  

The September 2018 rating decision did not address the reasonably raised TDIU issue, explicitly or implicitly, and the issue of entitlement to a TDIU remained unadjudicated until an April 2024 AOJ rating decision was issued granting entitlement to a TDIU.  An effective date of December 8, 2023 was assigned, as this was the date the AOJ found to be the date of claim for a TDIU.  The AOJ did not recognize that there was an open TDIU claim dating back to July 19, 2018.

Per the April 2024 AOJ rating decision, the TDIU was warranted based upon a combination of symptoms from the service-connected back disability, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and residuals of surgical scarring related to the back disability.  The AOJ went on to explain that, per the evidence of record, the Veteran last worked on April 20, 2015 due to no reasonable expectancy to return to work while on disability for back surgery, and Social Security Administration (SSA) records reported that the Veteran had been found disabled since September 6, 2014, due to the service-connected back disability (to include the lower extremity radicular symptoms).  Under the AMA the Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801.

The Board has reviewed the evidence of record, lay and medical, and finds the evidence at least in relative equipoise on the question of whether the occupational impairments warranting the grant of a TDIU at the time of the April 2024 AOJ rating decision have been present since July 19, 2018, when the question of entitlement to a TDIU was reasonably raised.  As such, the Board finds that, from July 19, 2018, the Veteran was unable to maintain substantially gainful employment as a result of service connected disabilities.

Considering the above, the Board finds the evidence at least in relative equipoise as to whether an earlier effective date of July 19, 2018 (date of intent to file for back disability rating increase) is warranted for the grant of a TDIU; therefore, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds entitlement to an earlier effective date of July 19, 2018 for the grant of a TDIU to be warranted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  For the reasons discussed in the introduction, this is a complete grant as to the sole issue on appeal.
