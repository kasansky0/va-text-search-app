ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran withdrew his appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal seeking service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Air Force from June 1996 to December 2008.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the January 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. 

Withdrawal of Appeal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. Id. 

On August 22, 2024, a report of contact was completed. It contains the Veteran's name, file number, and indicates that the Veteran expressed his desire to withdraw his appeal for sleep apnea with the Board. Additionally, it was annotated that the Veteran would provide a written statement. See VA Form 27-0820, Report of General Contact, dated August 22, 2024. On the same day, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, confirming in writing his desire to withdraw his appeal. 

Since the Veteran has withdrawn the appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
