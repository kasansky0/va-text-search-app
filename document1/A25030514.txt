REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for cause of death is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1968 to April 1970. The Appellant is his surviving spouse.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2024 rating decision issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The Veteran passed away on February 14, 2022. The immediate cause of death was unspecified natural causes, failure to thrive, and senile degeneration of the brain. Other significant conditions contributing to death were chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus. 

In March 2022, the Appellant filed a VA Form 21-534EZ, Application for DIC, Survivors Pension, and/or Accrued Benefits. The Appellant specified that she is claiming Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC).

In a November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for the Veteran's cause of death. In December 2023, the Appellant filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review. In the April 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for cause of death. 

In May 2024, the Appellant file a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, electing the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that remand is warranted for further development.

First, remand is necessary for further development of the issue of whether the Veteran was exposed to herbicides while service in the Republic of Korea. The Veteran's service personnel records show that he was stationed in the Republic of Korea. However, his service personnel records did not indicate whether the Veteran was stationed near or served along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) and thus subsequently presumptively exposed to herbicides. 

Additional research was performed, however, the Records Research Center only concluded that the Veteran's former unit's records did not mention the use or storage of herbicides or document any specific duties performed along the DMZ. See Records Research Center Response received August 2023. Remand is warranted for additional development to determine whether the Veteran was stationed near or served along the DMZ and was thus exposed to herbicides.

Under the AMA, when the Board identifies a duty to assist error occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., a pre-decisional duty to assist error), the Board will remand the appeal back to the AOJ with instructions to correct the error. See 38 C.F.R. 3.159(c), 20.802(a). Following correction of the error, the AOJ must readjudicate the issue or issues. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2502. After the AOJ readjudicates the issue or issues, a claimant may choose to file a new appeal to the board from such readjudication or request higher-level review (HLR) or a supplemental claim with the AOJ. 

Here, duty-to-assist errors exist in the development of the Veteran's potential herbicide exposure.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Contact the appropriate entity to clarify the findings in the August 2023 Records Research Response. Further information is requested as to the location of the duty station, and its proximity to the DMZ, of the 7th Supply and Transport Battalion of the 7th Infantry Division. Additional information is also requested as to whether the 7th Infantry Division, as a whole, performed any duties along the DMZ, and whether the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) would have been included in such duties.
