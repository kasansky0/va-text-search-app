ORDER

Service connection for a left hip disability, to include as secondary to service-connected lumbar spine disability and bilateral knee disabilities, is granted.

Service connection for a right hip disability, to include as secondary to service-connected lumbar spine disability and bilateral knee disabilities, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's left hip disability is proximately due to his service-connected lumbar spine disability and bilateral knee disabilities.

2. The Veteran's right hip disability is proximately due to his service-connected lumbar spine disability and bilateral knee disabilities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a left hip disability, to include as secondary to service-connected lumbar spine disability and bilateral knee disabilities, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

2. The criteria for service connection for a right hip disability, to include as secondary to service-connected lumbar spine disability and bilateral knee disabilities, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active-duty service from June 1957 to September 1987.

In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an August 2024 decision.  In September 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior August 2024 decision.  In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on February 27, 2025.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran, or his representative, at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

The Board notes that at the February 2025 hearing, the Veteran waived the 90-day period following the Board hearing for submitting additional evidence. As this decision grants the benefits sought on appeal, the Board finds no prejudice to the Veteran in adjudicating the claims at this time.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability, to include as secondary to service-connected lumbar spine disability and bilateral knee disabilities

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right hip disability, to include as secondary to service-connected lumbar spine disability and bilateral knee disabilities

The Veteran contends that his bilateral hip disabilities are due to service.  In the alternative, he claims that his bilateral hip disabilities are secondary to his service-connected lumbar spine disability and bilateral knee disabilities. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists, and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a)-(b). Secondary causation exists when, but for the service-connected disability, the non-service-connected was caused by a service-connected disability either in a direct, etiological way or via multiple steps in a causal chain. Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (citations omitted). Secondary aggravation exists when the non-service-connected disability not caused by a service-connected disability would be less severe were it not for a service-connected disability. Id. at 1364. For example, secondary aggravation may be established where the natural progression of the non-service-connected disability could have been arrested or improved but for the service-connected disability.

Analysis

The Veteran's service treatment records contain multiple Reports of Medical History where he reported that he had arthritis.  See Reports of Medical History from November 1979, March 1984, December 1984, January 1986, and August 1987.  However, the Board notes that these Reports of Medical History are based on the Veteran's own reports and do not indicate that he had arthritis of the hips, specifically.  As such, the presumption for service connection for chronic diseases does not apply in this case. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

Regarding direct service connection, VA opinions were obtained in July 2024. Here, a VA examiner found that the Veteran's bilateral hip disabilities were less likely than not due to his service.  The examiner noted that osteoarthritis of the hips "is a degenerative wear and tear process," and the Veteran's hip condition was first found in February 2013.  Bone scans from 2003 and 2004 were negative for osteoarthritis.  Thus, the examiner found that the Veteran's condition developed "more than 20 years after exiting service."  She added that the condition was due to the aging process and not due to his physical training in service.

Regarding secondary service connection, the Veteran was provided with a VA hip examination in May 2024 where he was diagnosed with bilateral osteoarthritis of the hips.  The VA examiner checked the box indicating that the Veteran's bilateral hip disabilities are due to a service-connected disability but did not indicate which service-connected disability.  The rationale provided was that the Veteran had hip pain radiating from his lumbar spine, and that his 30 years in service "can affect muscles and nerves, which can lead to lower back pain."  As this opinion was incomplete, VA requested an addendum opinion.  In July 2024, the same VA examiner provided an opinion that the Veteran has moderate osteoarthritis in both hips and a "spine condition does not cause hip arthritis," noting that these were separate diagnoses.  However, the Board notes that the opinion does not opine whether the Veteran's bilateral hip disabilities were aggravated by his service-connected lumbar spine disability.  An opinion regarding secondary service connection is inadequate if it does not address both causation and aggravation. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 138 (2013).  As such, this opinion is provided no probative value in this case.

At the February 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran was accompanied by a healthcare professional. This individual provided an opinion that the Veteran's bilateral hip disabilities are due to his service-connected lumbar spine disability and bilateral knee disabilities.  She testified that when a person has an issue in one joint, it can throw off the alignment of the body, resulting in other joint issues on the same side of the body.  The healthcare provider noted that is common for someone with the Veteran's back and knee issues to have alignment issues, an altered gait, and problems with their hips.  The Board finds that this medical opinion is probative because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

Upon review of the record, and after resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for a left and right hip disability is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
