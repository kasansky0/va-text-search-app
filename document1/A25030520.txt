REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1997 to September 2021.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In October 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued rating decisions addressing the Veteran's claims. In January 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the October 2021 rating decisions. Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and implicitly transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. See VA Form 20-0999 Higher-Level Review Return (February 2022).  In October 2022 the RO issued the supplemental claim on appeal.

In the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the October 2022 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). To establish service connection for a disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 38 F3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, including arthritis, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic (reliably diagnosed) in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). The requirement of a current disability is satisfied when a veteran has a disability at the time he files his service connection claim or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). However, when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of the diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).

Pain may be considered a disability for VA purposes if it results in a functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir., 2018).

The Veteran had active service in Iraq and Kuwait and is thus considered a Persian Gulf veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (e).

Under legislation specific to Persian Gulf veterans, service connection may be granted for objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability. Prior to August 10, 2022, the date of the enactment of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), service connection was warranted so long as the objective symptoms occurred either during service in the Southwest Asia Theater or manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than December 31, 2026, and cannot be attributed to any known clinical cause. 38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  On or after August 10, 2022, the manifestation period and the degree to which a qualifying chronic disability must manifest were eliminated.

The term "qualifying chronic disability" means a chronic disability resulting from any of the following (or any combination of any of the following): (A) an undiagnosed illness; (B) a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness (MUCMI) (such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome) that is defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms; (C) any diagnosed illness that the Secretary determines in regulations prescribed under subsection (d) warrants presumptive service connection. 38 U.S.C. § 1117 (a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(2)(i).

The term chronic means that the disability has existed for 6 months or more, to include intermittent episodes of improvement or worsening over that period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(4). An undiagnosed illness requires that the illness, by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(4).

Objective indications of a chronic disability include both "signs," in the medical sense of objective evidence perceptible to an examining physician, and other, non-medical indicators that are capable of independent verification. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(3). Disabilities that have existed for six months or more and disabilities that exhibit intermittent episodes of improvement and worsening over a six-month period will be considered chronic. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(4). Manifestations of an undiagnosed illness or MUCMI may include, but are not limited to, fatigue, signs or symptoms involving skin, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, neurological signs or symptoms, neuropsychological signs or symptoms, signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or lower), sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal signs or symptoms, cardiovascular signs or symptoms, abnormal weight loss, and menstrual disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (b).

The term MUCMI refers to a diagnosed illness without conclusive pathophysiology or etiology, that is characterized by overlapping symptoms and signs and has features such as fatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical findings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory abnormalities. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(2)(ii). 

Examples include but are not limited to: chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome. A multi-symptom illness is a MUCMI where either the etiology or pathophysiology of the illness is inconclusive. Stewart v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 383, 389-90 (2018). A multi-symptom illness is not a MUCMI where both the etiology and the pathophysiology of the illness are partially understood. Id. The determination of whether a MUCMI is "medically unexplained," that is, the etiology and pathophysiology of the multi-symptom illness, must be particular to the claimant's case. Id. at 291. Pathophysiology is the physiology of abnormal state, specifically, the functional changes that accompany a particular syndrome or disease.

Compensation shall not be paid, however, if there is affirmative evidence that an undiagnosed illness was not incurred during active military, naval or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War; or if there is affirmative evidence that an undiagnosed illness was caused by a supervening condition or events that occurred between the appellant's most recent departure from active duty in the Southwest theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War and the onset of the illness; or if there is affirmative evidence that the illness is the result of the appellant's own willful misconduct or the abuse of alcohol or drugs. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (c).

Effective August 10, 2022, the PACT Act, was signed into law. Pub. L. No. 117-168 (August 10, 2022), 38 U.S.C. § 1117, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022). The PACT Act provides that service connection may be established for a Persian Gulf veteran with a qualifying chronic disability that manifested to any degree at any time. 38 U.S.C. § 1117 (a)(1). Pursuant to the PACT Act, a Persian Gulf veteran is also presumed to have been exposed to certain substances, chemicals, and airborne hazards during service, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the covered veteran was not exposed to any such substances, chemicals, or hazards in connection with such service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1117 (a), 1119 (b)(1).

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of observable symptoms. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009). When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).

1. Service connection for a bilateral hip disability

A February 1999 service treatment record noted the Veteran complained of right hip pain after a fall.  In February 2021, the Veteran reported bilateral hip pain and burning for the past four years.  Gluteal tendonitis of the right hip was noted.

On the VA examination of the hips conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the Veteran reported daily bilateral hip pain.  The examiner diagnosed trochanteric pain syndrome of both hips.  

The Veteran reported bilateral hip pain during service.  The VA examination, conducted prior to his separation from service, included a diagnosis of trochanteric pain syndrome of both hips.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for trochanteric pain syndrome of both hips.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

The Board notes that the rating decision on appeal included two separate issues, "service connection for bilateral hip condition with pain," and "service connection for bilateral hip strain."  The Board has combined these into one issue in granting service connection.

2. Service connection for a bilateral ankle disability

A May 2020 service treatment record noted chronic bilateral ankle pain.  

On the VA examination of the ankles conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the Veteran reported daily bilateral ankle pain.  The examiner diagnosed lateral-collateral ligament sprain (chronic, recurrent) of both ankles.  

The Veteran reported bilateral ankle pain during service.  The VA examination, conducted prior to his separation from service, included a diagnosis of lateral-collateral ligament sprain (chronic, recurrent) of both ankles.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for bilateral ankle sprain.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

3. Service connection for a bilateral knee disability

Service treatment records dated in April 2016, November 2017, and May 2021 noted bilateral knee pain complaints.  

On the VA examination of the knees conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the Veteran reported daily bilateral knee pain.  The examiner diagnosed patellofemoral pain syndrome of both knees.  

The Veteran reported bilateral knee pain during service.  The VA examination, conducted prior to his separation from service, included a diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome of both knees.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for bilateral patellofemoral pain syndrome of the knees.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

4. Service connection for scars related to fibrosis (face neck and arms)

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to scars related to fibrosis: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported scars related to fibrosis (face neck and arms).  You have been diagnosed with a disability. Your VA examination completed on May 21, 2021, diagnosed hypertrophic scar, burn scarring on face, arms, and keloid scar.

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for keloid scar involving the right upper extremity, and for hypertrophic scar under his left arm.

The service treatment records note that in May 2016 the Veteran was seen with large areas of fibrosis scars on his arms and neck.  This was noted to be related to burn injury in 2014.  A July 2016 treatment record noted scar conditions and fibrosis of skin.

On VA scars examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner noted a history of "scarring from burns noted hot beans explosion to his right arm, face."  The examiner diagnosed burn scarring on the face, neck and arms.

On VA skin examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner noted that "for the claimed condition of fibrosis (burns) of skin (face, neck and arms) there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis."

The Board acknowledges that the VA skin and scars examinations appear contradictory, however as the VA examiner identified burn scars of the face, neck, and arms, and these appear consistent with the complaints noted in 2016.  Thus, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection is warranted for burn scars of the face, neck and arms. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

5. Service connection for xerosis cutis (eczema)

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to xerosis cutis: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported xerosis cutis (eczema) while on active duty. You have been diagnosed with a disability. Your VA examination completed on May 21, 2021, diagnosed dermatophytosis and PFB."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for dermatophytosis and pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB).

The service treatment records note that in July 2016 the Veteran was seen with complaints of dry skin on the right foot.  Xerosis cutis was noted.

On the VA skin examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner did not find any xerosis cutis or eczema.  The examiner noted that "for the claimant's condition of xerosis cutis (eczema) there is no diagnosis because the condition has resolved."

There is no medical evidence of xerosis cutis (eczema) in the post-service records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has any current residuals of xerosis cutis. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for xerosis cutis (eczema) is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have a current eczema disability, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

6. Service connection for viral syndrome

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to viral syndrome: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported viral syndrome."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in March 2005 the Veteran was seen with complaints of flu-like symptoms of sore throat, runny nose, dizziness, and cough.  Viral syndrome was noted.

On VA examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner did not find any viral syndrome.  The examiner noted that "for the claimant's condition of viral syndrome there is no diagnosis because the condition has resolved."

There is no medical evidence of viral syndrome in the post-service records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has any current residuals of viral syndrome. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for viral syndrome is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have a current viral disability, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

7. Service connection for bilateral elbow disability

8. Service connection for a bilateral forearm disability

9. Service connection for arthritis and locking of forearm

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to the bilateral elbow disability claim: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported a bilateral elbow condition."

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to the bilateral forearm disability claim: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported a bilateral forearm condition."

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to the arthritis and locking of forearm disability claim: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported arthritis and locking of forearm."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in January 2021 the Veteran was seen with complaints of bilateral forearm and elbow pain.  He reported stiffness of the elbow joints and "locking" of the right elbow.  

On VA elbow and forearm examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the Veteran reported right and left elbow pain.  The examiner stated: "For the claimant's claimed condition of left forearm condition with pain there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis. For the claimant's claimed condition of left elbow condition with pain there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis. For the claimant's claimed condition of arthritis and locking left forearm there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis."  The examiner further stated that "for the claimant's claimed condition of right forearm condition with pain there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis. For the claimant's claimed condition of arthritis and locking right forearm there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis. For the claimant's claimed condition of right elbow condition with pain there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis."

There is no medical evidence of a left or right elbow or forearm disability in the post-service records.

While the Veteran contends that he has arthritis of the forearms and/or elbows, he is not competent to diagnosis such, and there is no x-ray or other medical evidence of record to substantiate that contention.  As such, entitlement to service connection for arthritis of the forearms or elbows on a presumptive basis is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307, 3.309.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has any current right or left elbow or right or left forearm disability. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for bilateral elbow disability, bilateral forearm disability, and arthritis and locking of forearm is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have a current elbow or forearm disability, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

10. Service connection for palpitations

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to palpitations: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported palpitations."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note the Veteran reported palpitations in August 2016, March 2017, and September 2021.  

On VA heart examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the Veteran reported that during service he had frequent episodes of waking up with heart palpitations going to the ER thinking he was having a heart attack.  He reported he would have "powerful palpitation followed by panic attack."  The examiner noted that EKG, echocardiogram, and chest x-ray were all normal.  The examiner stated that for the Veteran's "claimed condition of palpitations there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis."

The Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for PTSD with panic attacks.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current disability manifested by palpitations, other than his already service-connected panic attacks. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for palpitations is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have a current disability manifested by palpitations, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

11. Service connection for right long finger disability

12. Service connection for right ring finger disability

13. Service connection for right index finger disability

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to the right long finger: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported right long finger pain with motion."

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to the right ring finger: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported right ring finger pain with motion."

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to the right index finger: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported finger sprain right index finger with pain limited motion and edema."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records show that in August 2009 the Veteran was seen with right index finger sprain.  In September 2009 the Veteran reported ongoing pain, stiffness, and swelling in the right index finger.  He reported having sprained the right index finger several weeks earlier.  X-rays were unremarkable.  

On VA hand and fingers examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner did not diagnose any disability of the right hand/fingers.  The examiner stated that for the Veteran's claimed conditions of right index finger with pain limited motion and edema; right ring finger pain with motion; and right long finger pain with motion, there was no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis.

There is no medical evidence of right index finger, long finger, or ring finger disability in the post-service records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has any current right index finger, long finger, or ring finger disability. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for right index finger, long finger, and ring finger disabilities is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have a current right index finger, long finger, or ring finger disability, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable.

14. Service connection for left ring finger disability

15. Service connection for left index finger disability

16. Service connection for left long finger disability

17. Service connection for pain in left fingers with limited motion and edema

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to the left long finger: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported left long finger pain with motion.

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to the left ring finger: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported left ring finger pain with motion.

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to the left index finger: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported left index finger pain with motion.

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to pain in left fingers with limited motion and edema: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty pain in left fingers with limited motion and edema. You have been diagnosed with a disability. Your VA examination completed on May 21, 2021, diagnosed a left thumb sprain."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for left thumb sprain.

The service treatment records note that in November 2017 the Veteran was seen with complaint of pain in left fingers.  This was noted in conjunction with a followup treatment for left thumb sprain that had occurred in September 2017.  

On VA hand and fingers examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner did not diagnose any disability of the left hand/fingers (other than left thumb sprain).  The examiner noted normal ranges of motion for the left hand fingers.  There was no swelling or deformity.  The examiner stated that for the Veteran's claimed conditions of left long finger pain with motion; left ring finger pain with motion; pain in left fingers with limited motion and edema; and left index finger pain with motion, there was no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis. 

There is no medical evidence of left index finger, long finger, or ring finger disability, or left finger limited motion and edema, in the post-service records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has any current left index finger, long finger, or ring finger disability, or any limited motion or edema of the fingers of the left hand. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for left index finger, long finger, and ring finger disabilities, and limited motion or edema of the left fingers, is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have a current left index finger, long finger, or ring finger disability, or any limited motion or edema of the fingers of the left hand, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

18. Service connection for mass-like density in chest

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to mass-like density in chest: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported Calvin Foster 267 69 2346 30 of 43 mass-like density in chest."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in September 2006 a chest x-ray showed an extrathoracic mass below the left axilla.

On VA respiratory examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner did not find evidence of mass-like density of the chests.  The July 2021 x-ray was conducted, and the results were normal.  The examiner noted that "for the claimant's claimed condition of mass-like density of the chest there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and/or symptoms to support a diagnosis."

There is no medical evidence of mass-like density of the chest in the post-service records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has any current residuals of mass-like density of the chest. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for mass-like density of the chest is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have any residuals of a mass-like density of the chest, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

19. Service connection for hyperlipidemia

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to hyperlipidemia: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported hyperlipidemia."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note hyperlipidemia in January 2006.

The Board observes that elevated or high cholesterol is also referred to as hypercholesterolemia or hyperlipidemia. Hyperlipidemia is "a general term for elevated concentrations of any or all of the lipids in the plasma, including hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, etc." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 795 (28th ed. 1994).

Hyperlipidemia and elevated cholesterol are laboratory findings and are not disabilities in and of themselves for which VA compensation benefits are payable. See 61 Fed. Reg. 20,440, 20,445 (May 7, 1996) (Diagnoses of hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, and elevated cholesterol are actually laboratory results and are not, in and of themselves, disabilities. They are, therefore, not appropriate entities for the rating schedule.)

Service connection can only be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110. As detailed herein, hyperlipidemia is a laboratory finding that manifests itself only in laboratory test results and is not a disability for which service connection can be granted. As such, service connection for hyperlipidemia is not warranted.

The Board is mindful of Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (a diagnosis is not required to meet the current disability requirement and pain alone can constitute disability if it causes impairment in earning capacity). Here, the Veteran has not asserted nor provided objective evidence that pain due to hyperlipidemia has been so severe as to cause functional impairment that affects his earning capacity. Thus, the Board does not find that the Veteran's claimed symptom rises to the level of a disability under Saunders.

In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Accordingly, service connection for hyperlipidemia is not warranted.

20. Service connection for subcutaneous nodules

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to subcutaneous nodules: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported nodules subcutaneous."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in June 1998 the Veteran was noted to have a subcutaneous nodule in the groin area.  

In July 2007 he was seen with a left axillary nodule secondary to prior staph infection.  The lesion was excised in September 2007.  

The Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for keloid scar from the excision surgery.

On VA skin examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner did not find any subcutaneous nodules. The examiner noted that "for the claimant's claimed condition of nodules- subcutaneous there is no diagnosis because the condition has resolved."

There is no medical evidence of subcutaneous nodules in the post-service records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has any current residuals of subcutaneous nodules (other than the already service connected keloid scar). Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for subcutaneous nodules is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have any current subcutaneous nodules, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

21. Service connection for pseudomonal

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to pseudomonal: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported pseudomonal."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in July 2016 pseudomonal was suspected.  

On VA infectious disease examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner did not find pseudomonal. The examiner noted that "for the claimant's claimed condition of pseudomonal there is no diagnosis because the condition has resolved."

There is no medical evidence of pseudomonal in the post-service records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has any current residuals of pseudomonal. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for pseudomonal is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have any current residuals of pseudomonal, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

22. Service connection for sinusitis

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to sinusitis: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported sinusitis."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in November 2013 the Veteran was prescribed an antibiotic for acute sinusitis.  In April 2015 he was seen with acute sinus symptoms along with fever and sore throat.  

On VA sinus examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner did not find sinusitis.  X-rays of the sinus were normal.  The examiner noted that "for the claimant's condition of sinusitis there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and/or symptoms to support a diagnosis."

There is no medical evidence of sinusitis in the post-service records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a diagnosis of sinusitis. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for sinusitis is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have sinusitis, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

23. Service connection for thyroid nodule

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to thyroid nodule: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported nodule on thyroid."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records include a May 2021 cervical spine MRI report that noted a five-millimeter T2 hyperintensity in the posterior superior right thyroid lobe that "may represent a thyroid microcyst, small parathyroid adenoma, or a small thyroid bed lymph node."  Subsequent thyroid laboratory workup was noted to be within normal range.  It was recommended to the Veteran that he followup with his primary care provider over the next 6-12 months.

On VA thyroid examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner noted normal physical examination of the neck, with no palpable thyroid enlargement or nodules.  No imaging studies were performed.  The examiner noted that "for the claimant's condition of nodule on thyroid there is no diagnosis because no evidence noted."

VA treatment records show that in December 2021 an ultrasound of the thyroid showed right thyroid lobe nodules. It noted that continued surveillance of the thyroid would be needed.

While the evidence shows that thyroid nodules have been identified clinically, there is no showing in the record of any resulting impairment of thyroid functioning, symptoms confirmed by a medical professional, or impairment of earning capacity.  The evidence persuasively reflects the Veteran's thyroid nodules are an incidental clinical finding without underlying or resulting disability.  Thus, the thyroid nodules are not a disability for VA compensation purposes.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a disability manifested by thyroid nodules. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for thyroid nodule is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have a disability manifested by thyroid nodules, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

24. Service connection for radiculopathy lumbosacral region (Hips)

25. Service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to radiculopathy of the lower extremities: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported bilateral radiculopathy of the lower extremities."

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to radiculopathy of the lumbosacral region: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported radiculopathy lumbosacral region (Hips)."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in May 2014 the Veteran was seen with complaints of low back pain radiating into his lower extremities.  In January 2019 he was seen for radiculopathy of the lumbosacral region.  Complaints of decreased sensation and diminished reflexes in the right leg were noted.  The examiner noted no clearly affected dermatome on examination.  Right ankle jerk reflexes were abnormal.  In March 2019, MRI of the lumbar spine showed L5-S1 tiny posterior central disc extrusion with T2 hyperintense fissure, which minimally contracts the transiting right S1 nerve root.  The impression was radiculopathy, lumbosacral region.   In March 2021, the Veteran was seen with burning and tingling pain into the bilateral lower extremities.  There was positive straight leg raising test bilaterally.  MRI of the lower extremities in February 2021 showed mild degenerative disc disease at L5-S1.  The MRI report noted "no significant canal or neuroforaminal stenosis. Bulging disc material approaches and possibly contacts the descending S1 nerve roots in the subarticular zone."

On VA back examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the Veteran reported symptoms of pain, numbness, tingling in buttocks and thighs, and numbness to feet.  On examination, muscle strength, reflexes, and sensory testing was normal in the lower extremities.  Straight leg raising test was negative bilaterally.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have radicular pain or any other signs or symptoms due to radiculopathy.  The examiner stated that for the Veteran's claimed conditions of left lower extremity radiculopathy; right lower extremity radiculopathy; and radiculopathy lumbosacral region, there was no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis. 

There is no medical evidence of radiculopathy of the lower extremities in the post-service medical records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of radiculopathy of the lower extremities or the lumbosacral region.  While radiculopathy was noted during service in 2019, it was not found to be present on the May 2021 VA examination.  Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for radiculopathy of the lumbosacral region and radiculopathy of the lower extremities is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The Board reiterates that the Veteran may file a supplemental claim at any time if there is new evidence showing radiculopathy associated with his service-connected lumbosacral disability.

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have radiculopathy of the lumbosacral region and radiculopathy of the lower extremities, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

26. Service connection for bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to radiculopathy of the upper extremities: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported bilateral radiculopathy of the upper extremities."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records noted radiculopathy, cervical region, in March 2021.  EMG and NCV testing in May 2021 found no electrophysiologic evidence of cervical radiculopathy.

On VA neck/cervical spine examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, muscle strength, reflexes, and sensory testing was normal in the upper extremities.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have radicular pain or any other signs or symptoms due to radiculopathy.  The examiner stated that for the Veteran's claimed conditions of left upper extremity radiculopathy and right upper extremity radiculopathy there was no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis. 

There is no medical evidence of radiculopathy of the upper extremities in the post-service medical records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of radiculopathy of the upper extremities.  While radiculopathy was noted during service in March 2021, EMG and NCV testing in May 2021 found no evidence of such radiculopathy of the upper extremities.  Further, upper extremity radiculopathy was not found to be present on the May 2021 VA examination.  Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for radiculopathy of the upper extremities is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The Board reiterates that the Veteran may file a supplemental claim at any time if there is new evidence showing radiculopathy associated with his service-connected cervical strain disability.

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have radiculopathy of the upper extremities, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

27. Service connection for lesion of plantar nerve, left lower limb

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to lesion of the plantar nerve left lower limb: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported a lesion of the plantar nerve left lower limb."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records noted a diagnosis of lesion of the plantar nerve left lower limb in March 2017. 

On VA foot examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner stated that for the Veteran's claimed condition of lesion of the plantar nerve left lower limb there was no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis. 

There is no medical evidence of lesion of the plantar nerve left lower limb in the post-service medical records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of lesion of the plantar nerve left lower limb.  Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for lesion of the plantar nerve left lower limb is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have lesion of the plantar nerve left lower limb, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

28. Service connection for asthma

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to asthma: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported asthma."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records include an October 2009 entry on which the Veteran reported periods of breathlessness.  It noted he was an avid runner and ran two miles per day.  There was no history of asthma.  Lungs were clear to auscultation.  The provisional diagnosis was dyspnea.  Chest x-ray was normal.

On VA respiratory examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, chest x-ray was normal.  The examiner did not find that the Veteran had asthma.  The examiner stated that for the Veteran's claimed condition of asthma there was no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis. 

There is no medical evidence of asthma in the post-service medical records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of asthma.  Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for asthma is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have asthma, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

29. Service connection for bilateral bunions

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to bunions: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported bilateral bunions."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records include a February 2017 left and right foot x-ray report that noted mild bilateral right greater than left hallux valgus angulation of the first digit with small median bunion deformity and lateralization of the sesamoids.  A February 2021 left and right foot x-ray report noted mild hallux valgus bilaterally, slightly worse on the right where there was a small bunion formation.  

On VA foot examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner did not find that the Veteran had bunion of either foot.  Examination noted diagnoses of plantar fasciitis and pes planus.  The examiner stated that for the Veteran's claimed condition of left and right foot bunion there was no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis. 

There is no medical evidence of bunions in the post-service medical records.

The Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for bilateral pes planus and plantar fasciitis and is in receipt of compensation for foot pain symptoms associated with those diagnoses.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of bilateral bunions.  Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for bilateral bunions is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have bilateral bunions, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

30. Service connection for amnesia

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to amnesia: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported amnesia."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in February 2021 the Veteran underwent cognitive-linguistic evaluation after reporting short-term memory issues.  He was informed of the likelihood of attention and memory problems surfacing more so in a noisy environment, with increased levels of headaches/pain, lack of sleep, mood issues (increased frustration/anxiety/depression), and/or under stressful situations.

The Veteran was advised that his recall problems were more likely to be due to his current complaints of headache, pain issues, mood changes, and sleep disturbances.

A March 2021 followup noted complaint of short-term memory issues.  It noted that he "misplaces objects, forgets where he parks, has difficulty with directions, has to use GPS to find way to base."  A notation of other amnesia was made.  

On VA psychiatric examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner diagnosed PTSD with panic attacks.  The examiner stated that there was no separate diagnosis of amnesia.  "Symptoms claimed as amnesia are consistent with concentration problems noted with PTSD with panic attacks. An additional diagnosis is not required."  

The Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for PTSD with panic attacks.

Under what is commonly known as the rule against pyramiding, the evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses is to be avoided. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current disability manifested by amnesia, other than his already service-connected PTSD with panic attacks. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for amnesia is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have a current amnesia disability, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

31. Service connection for bilateral wrist disability

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to bilateral wrists: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported a bilateral wrist condition with pain."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note complaints of pains in the wrists.  In February 2021 right wrist weakness was noted.  A June 2021 service treatment record noted range of motion of both wrists within normal limits.  

On VA wrist examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner did not find a left or right wrist disability.  

Ranges of motion of both wrists were normal.  No wrist pain was reported or noted.  The examiner stated for the claimed conditions of left and right wrist condition with pain there was no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis.

There is no medical evidence of left or right wrist disability in the post-service medical records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of left or right wrist disability.  Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for bilateral wrist disability is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of left or right wrist disability, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

32. Service connection for chest pain

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to chest pain: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported chest pain."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in July 2005 the Veteran reported experiencing off and on sometimes sharp chest-wall pain.  The assessment was non-cardiac pain.

In August 2016, the Veteran was seen with complaints of chest pain not associated with exertion.  Palpitations was diagnosed. In February 2017 and March 2017, chest pains and palpitations were again noted. 

On VA heart examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the Veteran reported current symptoms as painful chest pain, powerful palpitation followed by panic attack.  EKG, echocardiogram, and chest x-ray were normal.  The examiner stated that for the claimed condition of chest wall condition with pain there was no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis.

There is no medical evidence of disability manifested by chest pain in the post-service records.

The Board again notes that the Veteran is service connected for PTSD with panic attacks.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current disability manifested by chest pain (other than his already service-connected PTSD with panic attacks). Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for chest pain is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have a current disability manifested by chest pain, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

33. Service connection for closed fracture of metatarsal fifth (Right Foot)

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to fifth metatarsal fracture: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported a closed fracture of fifth (right foot)."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in March 2012 the Veteran injured his right foot playing basketball.  X-rays showed an avulsion fracture of the right fifth metatarsal.  The assessment was closed fracture of right fifth metatarsal.  An April 2013 x-ray of the right foot was normal other than narrowing and degeneration of the first metatarsal joint.

On the VA foot examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner did not find any metatarsal disability.  No metatarsalgia was present.  The examiner noted that "for the claimant's condition of closed fracture of metatarsal fifth right foot there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs or symptoms to support a diagnosis."

There is no medical evidence of residual disability from right fifth metatarsal fracture in the post-service records.

The Board again notes that the Veteran is service connected for bilateral pes planus and plantar fasciitis and is in receipt of compensation for foot pain symptoms associated with those diagnoses.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has any current residuals of right fifth metatarsal fracture. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for right fifth metatarsal fracture is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have current residuals of right fifth metatarsal fracture, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

34. Service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome

For VA purposes, the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome requires: (1) new onset of debilitating fatigue severe enough to reduce daily activity to less than 50 percent of the usual level for at least 6 months, and (2) exclusion, by history, physical examinations, and laboratory tests, of all other clinical conditions that may produce similar symptoms, and (3) 6 or more of the following: (i) acute onset of the condition, (ii) low grade fever, (iii) nonexudative pharyngitis, (iv) palpable or tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, (v) generalized muscle aches or weakness, (vi) fatigue lasting 24 hours or longer after exercise, (vii) headaches (of a type, severity or pattern that is different from headaches in the pre-morbid state), (viii) migratory joint pains, (ix) neuropsychologic symptoms, and (x) sleep disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.88 (a).

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to chronic fatigue: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported chronic fatigue syndrome."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in December 2017 the Veteran was seen for complaints of anxiety and fatigue.  In May 2021 chronic fatigue, unspecified was noted.

On VA chronic fatigue syndrome examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner found that the Veteran did not have chronic fatigue syndrome.  The examiner stated that for the claimed conditions of chronic fatigue syndrome and other fatigue "there is no diagnosis because fatigue is due to poor sleep."

On VA psychiatric examination in May 2021, the examiner noted that the symptoms of the Veteran's PTSD included sleep disturbance and chronic sleep impairment.  

The Veteran has not been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. 38 C.F.R. § 4.88 (a). The Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for obstructive sleep apnea and PTSD with panic attacks. 

Service connection based on 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 for the Veteran's fatigue complaints was considered. The May 2021 VA examiners found that the Veteran's fatigue was not chronic fatigue syndrome but was due to poor sleep, a symptom of his service-connected disabilities of PTSD and sleep apnea. As such, further consideration for service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current disability manifested by chronic fatigue, other than his already service-connected obstructive sleep apnea and PTSD with panic attacks. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have chronic fatigue syndrome, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

35. Service connection for chronic pain syndrome (joint pain)

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to chronic pain: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported chronic pain syndrome (joint pain)."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in April 2013 the Veteran was seen with complaint of musculoskeletal pain.  This was noted to involve his right shoulder.  

In June 2018 the Veteran reported multiple joint pains.  He did not want an in-depth evaluation at the moment; rather, he sought analgesics.  Chronic pain syndrome was noted.  

In February 2021, he was seen with complaints of "chronic musculoskeletal pain issues."  Pain involving the back, neck, arms, feet, knees, and hips was noted.

On VA fibromyalgia examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner found that the Veteran did not have fibromyalgia.  The examiner stated that for the claimed condition of chronic pain syndrome-joint pain "there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis. The Veteran has chronic joint pain, which is diagnosed under joint DBQs. He does not have fibromyalgia."

The Veteran has not been diagnosed with chronic pain syndrome during the pendency of the appeal. The Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for the following disabilities that are manifested by joint pain:  lumbosacral strain; cervical strain; right shoulder impingement syndrome, bicipital tendonitis, rotator cuff tendonitis, rotator cuff tear, AC joint osteoarthritis, and bursitis; left shoulder impingement syndrome, bicipital tendonitis, rotator cuff tendonitis, and rotator cuff tear; left thumb sprain; bilateral pes planus and plantar fasciitis; trochanteric pain syndrome of bilateral hips; bilateral ankle sprain; and patellofemoral pain syndrome of bilateral knees.

Service connection based on 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 for the Veteran's pain complaints was considered. The May 2021 VA examiner found that the Veteran's joint pain complaints did not represent fibromyalgia and indicated that his joint pain complaints were addressed in the individual joint examinations.  As such, further consideration for service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current disability manifested by chronic joint pain, other than his already service-connected lumbosacral strain; cervical strain; right shoulder impingement syndrome, bicipital tendonitis, rotator cuff tendonitis, rotator cuff tear, AC joint osteoarthritis, and bursitis; left shoulder impingement syndrome, bicipital tendonitis, rotator cuff tendonitis, and rotator cuff tear; left thumb sprain; bilateral pes planus and plantar fasciitis; trochanteric pain syndrome of bilateral hips; bilateral ankle sprain; and patellofemoral pain syndrome of bilateral knees.  

Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for chronic pain syndrome (joint pains) is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have chronic pain syndrome, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

36. Service connection for paresthesias of skin

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to paresthesias of skin: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty reported paresthesia of skin."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that in July 2005 the Veteran was noted to have complaints of tingling in the hands and feet.  In August 2016 he reported burning and tingling in the hands after doing push-ups.  Paresthesia of the skin was noted.  

In February 2021 the Veteran reported bilateral upper extremity paresthesias.  Lesion of ulnar nerve, bilateral upper extremities was noted.

On VA peripheral nerves examination conducted in May 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner did not find any paresthesia disability.  No ulnar nerve pathology was noted.  Reflex and sensory testing was normal bilaterally.  The examiner stated that for the claimed condition of paresthesia of the skin there was no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis.

There is no medical evidence of disability manifested by paresthesia of the skin in the post-service records.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current disability manifested by paresthesia of the skin. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for paresthesia of the skin is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have a current disability manifested by paresthesia of the skin, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

37. Service connection for TBI

The October 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings with respect to TBI: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease may have had its onset during your service. Your VA Form 21-526EZ received on April 14, 2021, while on active-duty traumatic brain injury."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records note that on a September 2009 post-deployment health assessment, the Veteran answered "yes" to the question of "while deployed, were you involved in a motor vehicle accident, a fall, a sports accident, or any other event that caused a blow to your head or that resulted in a neck whiplash?" He also answered "yes" to the question of whether "as a result of the event, were you dazed, 'saw stars', 'bell rung', or 'lights knocked out'?"  TBI screening noted that the Veteran appeared to have suffered a concussion in June 2009 but that he had no current evidence of cognitive impairment.  Self-reported concussion with no loss of consciousness was noted.

A CT of the head in November 2017, following a report of multiple falls, was normal. In January 2021 the Veteran was seen with report of personal history of TBI/concussion "several years ago."  He denied current symptoms other than migraine headaches.   

On VA TBI examination conducted in June 2021, while the Veteran was still on active duty, the examiner stated that the Veteran did not now have and had not ever had a TBI or any residuals of TBI.  The Veteran reported having several head injuries over the years. "The worst one was in 2009 while he was in Iraq. They were taking in Mortar fire. He dove in a van and one of the tough cases fell on his head. He saw stars and felt his bell rung. There was laceration on his scalp on the right side. He did not lose consciousness but felt dazed and confused for a couple of days." There was no posttraumatic amnesia. "The second one was in 2016 when he had a car accident in Germany. He was driving and the car in front of him came to a sudden stop. He hit the car, and the airbags deployed. He felt dazed and confused and saw stars. He had bruises from airbags on his face and neck. The police and then the MP came and he was sent back to the base."  

The Veteran reported that in 2019 he had another car wreck in Virginia when he rear-ended a vehicle that was stopped on the road. He stated that the airbags were deployed, and he felt dazed and shocked. "No LOC, AOC or PTA."  The Veteran reported that he forgets things like names of people he recently met. He needs directions to reach a place. He forgets where the Home key is in on the keyboard. He reported having vertigo, migraines and ringing in the ears.  The examiner noted a history of concussion but stated that for the Veteran's claimed condition of TBI there was no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis.

On a May 2022 VA TBI note, the Veteran's reported history of multiple mild TBIs in service was noted.  The Veteran reported symptoms of memory problems and headaches.  

The Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for migraines and Meniere's syndrome with vertigo and tinnitus.  He is also service-connected for PTSD with panic attacks; among the compensated symptoms of that disability is memory loss.

The Veteran was seen in service with reports of head injuries, but a TBI was not objectively found.  The VA examiner in June 2021 did not find evidence of TBI or TBI residuals.  To the extent that the Veteran contends that he experiences symptoms of memory loss, headaches, tinnitus, and vertigo that he attributes to TBI in service, the Board notes that he is already service connected for such symptoms/disabilities as described above.

As the Veteran does not have objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.

In the absence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. The competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current TBI disability. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for TBI is denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Finally, the Board notes that, as the Veteran does not have a current TBI disability, any additional development concerning potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) are not applicable. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

Initial Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the Schedule For Rating Disabilities, which assigns ratings based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

38. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD with panic attacks

The Veteran's PTSD with panic attacks is currently rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 rates mental disorders by applying the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula). Under the General Formula, the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made. Thus, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Under the General Formula, the current 50 percent rating contemplates symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

Evidence

The Veteran underwent a VA psychiatric examination in May 2021 while still on active duty. The Veteran reported that he and his wife had two children. One child remained in the home. He reported that the marriage had had ups and downs but there were no current marital issues. The Veteran reported that he spent his time at home, and he relied on his wife to handle the finances.  The Veteran was currently on active duty but pending retirement; he had no specific job plans for the period following retirement.  The examiner noted symptoms of depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks more than once a week; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events; flattened affect; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

On examination, the Veteran's mood was irritable.  Affect was somewhat flat.  He was alert, oriented and cooperative. He occasionally heard words; it was not clear if this was related to tinnitus.  The examiner opined that the level of occupational and social impairment the Veteran experienced was best characterized as 'occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.'  

An October 2021 VA treatment record noted that the Veteran reported that overall, he was doing well with his recent retirement and was adjusting to being a civilian.  His behavior was polite.  Speech was within normal limits.  Mood was euthymic.  He was alert and oriented x4.  His memory appeared within normal limits although not formally tested. His thoughts were clear.  There were no flight of ideas or loose associations.  There was no evidence of thought disorder, hallucinations or delusions. Insight and judgment appeared intact.  The Veteran denied suicidal or homicidal ideation.  

Analysis

The Board finds that the criteria for a rating in excess of 50 percent are not met. 

The evidence during the period on appeal does not show that the type of symptoms contemplated in the criteria for a 70 percent rating were met. This include symptoms such as suicidal ideation; speech intermittently illogical, obscure or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; or an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. 

The VA examiner noted that the Veteran had a difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. He did not find that the Veteran had an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. The Veteran was still on active duty pending retirement.  Regarding social relationships, the Veteran had no current marital difficulties with his wife.  The Veteran denied having suicidal ideation and he did not report neglecting appearance and hygiene. The May 2021 examiner opined that the Veteran's level of occupational and social impairment overall was best summarized as occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  This level of impairment is consistent with the currently assigned 50 percent rating. The Board finds the VA examiner's assessment highly probative. The examiner was a psychologist and thus had the necessary clinical training, education and expertise to evaluate the Veteran and assess the overall severity of his service-connected psychiatric disorder. Furthermore, the examiner interviewed the Veteran and reviewed the file in making his assessment. For these reasons, the Board finds the examiner's assessment regarding the Veteran's overall level of occupational and social impairment highly persuasive.  The Board also finds it significant that an October 2021 treatment record conducted months after the VA examination shows that the Veteran was doing well and adjusting to retirement.  

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the assignment of a rating in excess of 50 percent, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. The claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, (Fed. Cir. 2021).

39. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for Meniere's syndrome, vertigo to include tinnitus

Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the assigned rating; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.27 provide that unlisted disabilities requiring rating by analogy will be coded with the first two numbers of the schedule provisions for the most closely related body part and 99. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Here, the hyphenated diagnostic code indicates that tinnitus (Diagnostic Code 6260) was rated under the criteria for Meniere's syndrome (Diagnostic Code 6205). See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20.

DC 6205, the code for Meniere's disease, provides for a 30 percent rating with hearing impairment with vertigo less than once a month, with or without tinnitus. A 60 percent rating is warranted for hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring from one to four times a month, with or without tinnitus. A 100 percent rating is assigned for hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring more than once weekly, with or without tinnitus.

The Note associated with DC 6205 states, evaluate Meniere's syndrome either under these criteria or by separately evaluating vertigo (as a peripheral vestibular disorder), hearing impairment, and tinnitus, whichever method results in a higher overall evaluation. But do not combine an evaluation for hearing impairment, tinnitus, or vertigo with an evaluation under diagnostic code 6205.

DC 6204, for peripheral vestibular disorders, provides a 10 percent rating for occasional dizziness, and a 30 percent rating for dizziness and occasional staggering.

DC 6260 provides a 10 percent rating for recurrent tinnitus, whether the sound is perceived in one ear, both ears, or in the head. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6260, Note (2).

Evidence

Service treatment records note no gait abnormality in February 2021.  Physical therapy for vertigo symptoms is noted from March 2021 to May 2021.  The Veteran reported that vertigo was a "daily part of his life."

On VA ear conditions examination in May 2021, the Veteran reported symptoms of constant ringing in the ears, dizziness, pressure in ears, headaches, fatigue, clumsiness and nausea.  The examiner noted vertigo less than once per month lasting less than one hour.  Examination of the ear canals and tympanic membranes was normal.  The Veteran had normal gait.  Romberg, Dix-Hallpike, and limb coordination tests were normal.  

On VA tinnitus examination in May 2021, the Veteran reported that his tinnitus prevented him from falling asleep, and he used a fan as a masker. 

An October 2021 VA treatment record noted that the Veteran reported increased episodes of vertigo.  

In a written statement dated in October 2021, the Veteran reported that his episodes of vertigo occurred at least once per week/four times per month and that he had recently been prescribed Meclizine.

Analysis

Based on the evidence above, an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's Meniere's syndrome with vertigo and tinnitus is not warranted.

Under DC 6205, a 60 percent rating is warranted for hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring from one to four times a month, with or without tinnitus. According to the May 2021 VA examination for ear conditions, the Veteran did not have hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait and contemporaneous evidence of record do not indicate such. 

The examiner noted vertigo less than once per month lasting less than one hour.  No cerebellar gait was noted on examination or in the treatment records.  

The Veteran has reported that he experienced vertigo at least once per week/four times per month.  He is competent to report symptoms of vertigo.  However, as the record does not establish the presence of attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring from one to four times a month, a higher rating is not warranted under DC 6205.

Regarding DC 6204, the Veteran currently has the maximum schedular rating at 30 percent, and the maximum rating for tinnitus is 10 percent (DC 6260).

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for Meniere's syndrome with vertigo and tinnitus.

As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 30 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. The claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, (Fed. Cir. 2021).

40. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral pes planus and plantar fasciitis

The Veteran's bilateral foot disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276, for acquired flatfoot. Under Diagnostic Code 5276, a noncompensable rating is warranted for mild acquired flatfoot; symptoms relieved by built-up shoe or arch support. A 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate acquired flat foot; weight-bearing line over or medial to great toe, inward bowing of the tendo achillis, pain on manipulation and use of the feet, bilateral or unilateral. A 20 percent rating is assigned for severe unilateral acquired flat foot; objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use, characteristic callosities. A 30 percent rating is warranted for severe bilateral acquired flat foot; objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use, characteristic callosities. A 30 percent rating is also warranted for pronounced unilateral acquired flatfoot; marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo achillis on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances. A maximum 50 percent rating is warranted for bilateral acquired flatfoot; marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo achillis on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276.

Historically, plantar fasciitis was rated by analogy, usually under Diagnostic Code 5276 or Diagnostic Code 5284; however, effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating schedule by adding Diagnostic Code 5269 for plantar fasciitis. Under Diagnostic Code 5269, a 10 percent rating is warranted for unilateral or bilateral plantar fasciitis that do or does not meet the criteria for a higher rating. A 20 percent rating is warranted for unilateral plantar fasciitis where there is no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment. A 30 percent rating is warranted for bilateral plantar fasciitis where there is no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment.

Evidence

On VA foot examination in May 2021, the examiner noted bilateral pes planus and bilateral plantar fasciitis.  The examiner note pain on use of the feet.  There was no pain on manipulation of the feet.  There was no indication of swelling on use.  There were no characteristic calluses.  The Veteran used arch supports for both feet but remained symptomatic.  There was no extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet.  There was no decreased longitudinal arch height with weight bearing.  There was no marked deformity of either foot.  There was no marked pronation of either foot.  The weight bearing line was not medial to or over the great toe for either foot. There was no inward bowing of the Achilles tendon of either foot. There was no marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the Achille tendon on manipulation.  Non-surgical treatment did not relieve the Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis.  The Veteran had not undergone surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis.  He had not been recommended for surgical treatment but was not a surgical candidate.  The examiner noted functional loss from plantar fasciitis due to pain, during flare-ups and/or when the joint is used repeatedly over a period of time due to pain with running and prolonged standing.  

Analysis

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral plantar fasciitis and pes planus.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's report of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain, particularly with running and prolonged standing. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating severe bilateral acquired flatfoot. 

The VA examiner noted pain on use of the feet, but not objective evidence of marked deformity, indication of swelling on use, or characteristic callosities. As such, the evidence does not support a finding of severe flatfoot under Diagnostic Code 5276.

Under Diagnostic Code 5269 for plantar fasciitis, a 20 percent rating is not warranted as the evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran had surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis, or that he was recommended for such and was not a surgical candidate.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral plantar fasciitis and bilateral pes planus.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a higher rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

41. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD to include irritable bowel syndrome

The Veteran's GERD with IBS has been rated pursuant to Diagnostic Codes 7319-7346.

Pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7346, for hiatal hernia, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation, but at less severity. A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), pyrosis (heartburn), and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. The maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346.

Under Diagnostic Code 7319, for irritable colon syndrome, a non-compensable rating is assigned for mild symptoms that include disturbances of bowel function with occasional episodes of abdominal stress. A 10 percent rating is assigned for moderate symptoms that entail frequent episodes of bowel disturbances with abdominal distress. A 30 percent rating is assigned when there are severe symptoms that include diarrhea or alternating diarrhea, and constipation with more or less constant abdominal distress. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7319.

A note at the beginning of 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 indicates that codes such as Diagnostic Codes 7319 and 7346 are not to be combined with each other. A single evaluation will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such evaluation.

The terms 'considerable' and 'severe' are not defined in the Rating Schedule. 'Considerable' is defined by the dictionary as 'large in extent or degree,' and 'severe' is defined as 'very painful or harmful.' See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267, 1140 (11th ed. 2012). VA must evaluate all evidence, to the end that decisions will be equitable and just. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, it is not dispositive of an issue. Instead, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding a request for a higher disability rating. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Evidence

On VA esophageal conditions examination in May 2021, the Veteran reported current symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, and belching.  He used Omeprazole for treatment of GERD.  The examiner noted the following symptoms:  pyrosis, reflux, and regurgitation.  The examiner stated that GERD did not affect the Veteran's ability to work.  

On VA intestinal conditions examination in May 2021, the Veteran reported current symptoms of "diarrhea to the point I was severely dehydrated, involuntary bowel movements caused by severe back pain."  The Veteran used Imodium AD for treatment.  The examiner noted diarrhea every week.  The Veteran did not have episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress, or exacerbations or attacks of the intestinal condition.  There was no weight loss attributable to IBS.  The Veteran did not have malnutrition, serious complications, or other general health effects attributable to IBS.  The examiner stated that IBS did not affect the Veteran's ability to work.  

Analysis

For the reasons that follow, the Veteran's GERD with IBS manifested in two or more symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation under DC 7346 of less severity.

The VA examiner noted symptoms of pyrosis, reflux, and regurgitation.  However, the examiner did not find persistently recurrent epigastric distress; substernal or arm or shoulder pain; or considerable impairment of health.

Accordingly, the Veteran's GERD with IBS manifested in two or more symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity throughout the appeal period, corresponding to the criteria for a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7346.

A higher 30 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 7346 is not warranted unless there is persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. The record does not reflect this level of severity. 

A higher 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7346 is not warranted. 

Furthermore, the record does not demonstrate symptoms that would result in a disability rating in excess of 10 percent under Diagnostic Code 7319.  

The VA examiner noted diarrhea every week.  The examiner did not endorse more or less constant abdominal distress.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD with IBS.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a higher rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

Finally, the Board has considered whether entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) is warranted.

VA has a "well-established" duty to maximize a claimant's benefits. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008). SMC is payable at the housebound rate where the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and, in addition: (1) has a service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability, and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i).

After consideration of the facts of this case, however, the Board does not find that an SMC rating is for application at this time. The Veteran has a combined rating of 100 percent, however there is no one disability ratable at 100 percent independent of the other service-connected disabilities.
