ORDER

Readjudication of the claim of service connection for tinnitus is warranted.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. New evidence was received after the July 2021 denial that is relevant to the issue of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

2. The evidence is approximately balanced as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to in-service acoustic trauma.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for readjudicating the claim of service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).

2. With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1972 to August 1974.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO), which found that new and relevant evidence was not received and confirmed the previous denial of service connection for tinnitus.  

In a July 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182), the Veteran timely appealed the August 2022 rating decision to the Board and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the RO.  38?C.F.R. §?20.202.  As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on the issue or issues on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board will not consider evidence added to the record after the date of the AOJ decision on appeal.  If evidence was added during this ineligible period, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, he may at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

New and Relevant Evidence

The AMA provides: "If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to a supplemental claim, the Secretary shall readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record."  38 U.S.C. § 5108(a).  The implementing regulation clarifies that "a claimant may file a supplemental claim and . . . [i]f new and relevant evidence . . . is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the agency of original jurisdiction will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record."  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d). Relevant evidence is defined in the AMA as "evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue."  38 U.S.C. § 101(35).  The implementing regulation clarifies that "[r]elevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim.  Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed."  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).

The threshold question in this case is whether VA received new and relevant evidence since the July 2021 denial of service connection for tinnitus.  For the reasons below, a private opinion was added to the record since the prior denial which tends to prove the nexus element of the claim for service connection for tinnitus, and therefore is new and relevant.  Readjudication of the claim is therefore warranted.

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted on a direct basis if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service incurrence of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Tinnitus 

In a May 2023 letter, a private nurse practitioner noted the Veteran was diagnosed with tinnitus.  Thus, a current disability has been shown.  

In the May 2021 Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) the Veteran stated he was exposed to hazardous noise as an administrative specialist.  Military noise exposure was conceded in a favorable finding in the January 2021 rating decision and this favorable finding is binding on the Board.  The in-service injury requirement has thus been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(4); 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). 

The remaining question is whether a nexus exists between the Veteran's current tinnitus and his in-service acoustic trauma.

In the May 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ the Veteran stated that a ringing in his ears began while he was on active duty.  This statement indicates that he experienced in-service tinnitus which has persisted since that time which he is competent to report.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  As the Veteran's statements have been internally consistent, consistent with the other evidence of record, and consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service, the Board concludes that his reports of tinnitus in the years since service are credible.

A May 2023 private nurse practitioner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus is at least as likely as not due to and/or related to noise exposures during his military service.  The private nurse practitioner explained the Veteran's credible statements indicate he was exposed to hazardous noise while in service which caused his tinnitus. Although the private nurse practitioner's opinion was not extensive, reading the opinion as a whole it is based on the Veteran's credible and competent reporting and is consistent with the evidence of record showing hearing loss symptoms in and since service.  Therefore, the private opinion is afforded some probative weight.  See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012) (the fact that the rationale provided by an examiner "did not explicitly lay out the examiner's journey from the facts to a conclusion," did not render the examination inadequate); Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record).

Based on the May 2023 private nurse practitioner's opinion and the Veteran's competent and credible statements, the evidence of record is approximately balanced as to whether his tinnitus was caused by in-service noise exposure.  As the reasonable doubt created by the relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
