ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 31, 2022 for the grant of service connection for metatarsalgia (claimed as left and right foot pain) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In an August 2018 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for metatarsalgia (claimed as left and right foot pain); the decision became final because the Veteran did not perfect an appeal to the Board and VA did not receive new and material evidence within a year of the denial.

2. On January 31, 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) and requested review of the August 2018 AOJ denial; there is no earlier VA Form 20-0995 for metatarsalgia (claimed as left and right foot pain), and no basis for an effective date earlier than January 31, 2022 for the grant of service connection for metatarsalgia.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than January 31, 2022 for the grant of service connection for metatarsalgia have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1971 to January 1973.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following his appeal of a September 2024 rating decision.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. 

The undersigned Veterans Law Judge held a hearing on this appeal on December 18, 2024. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the December 18, 2024 hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. See 38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a). The Board cannot consider (1) evidence submitted during the period after the date of the September 2024 rating decision and before the date of the hearing, or (2) evidence submitted more than 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. § 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that on January 13, 2025, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ alleging clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the August 2018 rating decision that denied his claims for service connection for left and right foot pain. The question of whether there was CUE in an AOJ rating decision must be addressed in the first instance by the AOJ. If the claim is denied by the AOJ, then the Veteran may choose to appeal that decision to the Board. Thus, the Board's current decision addresses entitlement to an earlier effective date on bases other than CUE in the August 2018 rating decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 31, 2022 for the grant of service connection for metatarsalgia (claimed as left and right foot pain) is denied.

Under the modernized (Appeals Modernization Act, or AMA) review system, effective February 19, 2019, a claimant who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the previously denied claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.

The effective date of a service connection award based on an initial or supplemental claim for compensation benefits made more than one year following separation from service is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Under the AMA, if a claimant "continuously pursues" an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options (such as a supplemental claim) within one year of the issuance of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). However, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

Turning to the record, service connection for the Veteran's foot disabilities was initially denied by the AOJ in an August 2018 rating decision. The Veteran was notified of that decision and his appellate rights that month, and he did not appeal or submit new and material evidence within one year. Therefore, the decision became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b); 19.52, 20.1103; see also Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011); Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 251-52 (2010). 

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran disagreed with the effective date assigned for metatarsalgia in a September 24, 2024 rating decision. In that decision, the AOJ had assigned an effective date of January 31, 2022.

The Board finds that an earlier effective date is not warranted.

In a March 2022 statement, the Veteran asserted that he did not timely respond to the August 2018 rating decision "due to extreme unforeseen circumstances beyond [his] control." The Veteran stated that those circumstances were a diagnosis of prostate cancer in 2018 and subsequent treatment in 2019, followed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are no clinical records indicating the Veteran was hospitalized or incapacitated or incapable of timely filing a NOD during the time he had to do it. Moreover, he did not file any motion asking for more time (an extension) to file a NOD.

To benefit from equitable tolling, meaning to suspend the time he had for filing that necessary NOD, there must be satisfaction of three elements: (1) extraordinary circumstance; (2) due diligence; and (3) causation. See Checo v. Shinseki, 748 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (citing McCreary v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 324, 332 (2005)) (applying equitable tolling to the timeliness of the filing of a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).) While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's health issues, none of the three factors apply in his situation. In addition, the one-year period of time to file a NOD expired in August 2019, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, equitable tolling is not warranted. While it is regrettable that the Veteran did not submit a NOD within one year of the August 2018 rating decision, regulations are binding on all who seek to come within their sphere, regardless of actual knowledge of what is in the regulations or of the hardship resulting from innocent ignorance. See Morris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 260, 265 (1991) (citing Fed. Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 384-85 (1947)). Lack of awareness, or misunderstanding of the filing requirements, is not a legal basis for assigning an earlier effective date.

As the Veteran did not timely appeal the August 2018 rating decision or submit new and material evidence within a year of that decision, it became final. The Board also notes that, although service records were submitted after that decision, they are duplicative of service records that were in the file at the time of the August 2018 denial. 

On January 31, 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) and requested review of the August 2018 rating decision. This was more than one year after the August 2018 denial. In the September 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ found the Veteran's January 31, 2022 supplemental claim to have been continuously pursued and granted service connection for metatarsalgia effective the date of the claim, January 31, 2022.

As noted above, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, the effective date will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2). 

Based on the foregoing, and absent a finding of CUE in the 2018 rating decision, a question that has yet to be adjudicated, as discussed above, there is no basis to assign an earlier effective date. The evidence is persuasively against entitlement to an effective date prior to January 31, 2022 for the award of service connection for metatarsalgia, and the claim must be denied.

The Board again notes that the Veteran's CUE allegation is pending at the AOJ and will be addressed at that level, and he will have the opportunity to appeal the decision to the Board if the AOJ does not find CUE in the August 2018 rating decision.
