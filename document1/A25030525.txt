DOCKET NO. 240823-466837
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is dismissed.

The appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to promulgation of a decision, in September 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received written notification from the Veteran requesting withdrawal of his appeal regarding the claims of entitlement to service connection for IBS and migraine headaches.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for IBS are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran, who served on active duty in the United States Navy from April 1988 to April 1992, selected the Hearing Lane by submitting a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement in response to May 2024 and August 2024 rating decisions issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Here, in September 2024, prior to having his hearing scheduled, the Veteran submitted a statement indicating that he wished to withdraw his appeal under Docket No. 240823-466837, which includes the issues of entitlement to service connection for IBS and migraine headaches.

Accordingly, as there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration, the appeal is dismissed.
