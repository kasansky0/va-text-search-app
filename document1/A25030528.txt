2. The appeal of the claim of entitlement to service connection for hypothyroidism as secondary to service-connected thyroid cancer is dismissed as moot. 38 U.S.C.      § 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(a); Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1989 to June 1994 and from June 2010 to February 2011. The Veteran has a schedular 100 percent VA disability rating, effective from September 22, 2023, for asthma and special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(s).

As to hypothyroidism, the rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

As to thyroid cancer, in March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of that matter most recently addressed in a November 2021 rating decision.  In September 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of this October 2023 supplemental decision.  In October 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, granting the claim.

On March 15, 2024, the Board received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket for review of the claims for service connection for hypothyroidism and thyroid cancer. On that same day, the Veteran also filed VA Form 20-0996 for HLR by the AOJ of the same matters. Next, in April 2024, the AOJ granted service connection for hypothyroidism.

The Board has jurisdiction in all matters where there is a question of law or fact necessary for a decision by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans or their dependents or survivors. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

Here, the benefit sought has been granted in full. Hence, there remains no remaining allegation of error of fact or law for Board consideration. See Rating Decision - Narrative (October 2023); Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (noting that a grant of service connection extinguishes appeals before the Board); Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 396 (1999) (effective date is a "downstream matter" addressed after the benefit has been awarded).

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
