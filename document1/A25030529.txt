REMANDED

Service connection for hypertension is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1977 to October 1980, from April 1981 to March 1987, and from March 1987 to May 1992. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service connection for hypertension.

The Veteran seeks service connection for hypertension, claiming that his hypertension is related to service. See August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. The Veteran described working in spaces with loud equipment during service. Id. 

Remand is necessary to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The record suggests the AOJ did not obtain some of the Veteran's private medical treatment records for hypertension, which are relevant to his claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(1). Additionally, the AOJ did not provide the Veteran with an adequate medical examination and opinion. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4). When VA undertakes to examine a Veteran, VA is obligated to ensure that the examination is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21. Vet. App. 303 (2007). 

First, the evidence suggests the AOJ may not have obtained some of the Veteran's relevant private medical treatment records for hypertension. Hypertension is a chronic disease, so the Veteran may establish a medical nexus through a showing of continuity of symptomatology since service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a); 3.307 (a); 3.303 (b); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The Veteran indicated that he received medical treatment from D.I.M. beginning in March 1998, but the records that the AOJ received from D.I.M. begin with December 2010. See August 2023 VA Form 21-4142; September 2023 Medical Treatment Records. Although the Veteran's claim was not filed until August 2023, medical records from March 1998 are relevant because they may tend to show a continuity of symptomatology since service. Since VA has only attempted to obtain the Veteran's private treatment records from D.I.M. once, remand is appropriate to afford the AOJ an opportunity to attempt to obtain the outstanding private treatment records from D.I.M. for dates between March 1998 to December 2010. 

The September 2023 VA examination and medical opinion is inadequate. Inadequate medical examinations include examinations that contain only data and conclusions, do not provide an etiological opinion, are not based upon a review of medical records, or provide unsupported conclusions. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). The examiner did not confirm a diagnosis for hypertension because the claims file contained "Insufficient Evidence of Record." See September 2023 VA Examination. The examiner indicated the Veteran's hypertension is less likely than not related to in-service toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) because the evidence did not show a hypertension diagnosis. Id. However, the examiner did not have the benefit of reviewing the Veteran's private medical treatment records. 

The Veteran reported receiving private medical treatment for hypertension at D.I.M. See August 2023 VA Form 21-4142. VA requested the Veteran's medical records from D.I.M. and requested a VA examination and medical opinion. See August 2023 Notification Letter; August 2023 Exam Request. VA received the Veteran's private medical treatment records from D.I.M. on September 7, 2023. See September 2023 Medical Treatment Record. The VA examination was conducted on September 8, 2023. See September 2023 VA Examination. The Veteran's treatment records from D.I.M. were apparently not available for the examiner to review at the time of the examination. Records from D.I.M. reveal the Veteran is diagnosed with hypertension and show medical treatment for hypertension from December 2010 to September 2023. See September 2023 Medical Treatment Record. Thus, the September 2023 VA examination is inadequate because the examiner did not review the Veteran's private medical treatment records showing diagnosis and treatment for hypertension. Nieves- Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304; Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 124. Further, the September 2023 VA medical opinion is not adequate because the examiner did not opine as to whether the Veteran's hypertension is directly related to his service and offered only a medical opinion regarding the relationship between hypertension and the Veteran's in-service TERAs. Id. 

The September 2023 VA medical opinion finding hypertension is less likely than not related to the Veteran's TERA is also inadequate. An adequate rationale must discuss the specifics of the Veteran's in-service TERAs to conduct a synergistic, combined effect analysis of the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a)(2)(B). VA memos verified the Veteran had qualifying deployments in Southwest Asia during 1991 to 2001 that satisfied the criteria for presumptive toxic exposure, or in other words, burn pit and other toxin (BPOT) exposure. See December 2022 VA Memo; January 2023 VA Memo; 38 U.S.C. § 1117; 1119. The examiner did not discuss whether there is a relationship between hypertension and the Veteran's in-service TERAs. Therefore, the examiner's medical opinion regarding the relationship between hypertension and the Veteran's in-service TERAs is also inadequate. See Nieves- Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304; Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 124.

For the above reasons, the matter is remanded to afford the AOJ an opportunity to obtain outstanding private treatment records from D.I.M. and to obtain an adequate VA examination and medical opinion. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain and associate with the claims file any outstanding private treatment records for the Veteran's hypertension, including records from D.I.M. from March 1998 to December 2010.

2. After completing the above, obtain an addendum medical opinion to determine the etiology of the Veteran's hypertension. After reviewing the claims file, the examiner must provide the following opinions:

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's hypertension was incurred in or is otherwise related to his active service? Why or why not? 

(b.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that there is a relationship between the Veteran's hypertension and his TERAs, specifically exposure to burn pits? Why or why not?

The examiner must consider the total potential exposure through the Veteran's applicable military deployments, and the synergistic, combined effect of all his TERA.

A complete rationale for any opinion expressed shall be provided. If the examiner determines that one aspect of the Veteran's history is more likely to be related to the Veteran's hypertension than another, the rationale must explain how the examiner made that determination.
