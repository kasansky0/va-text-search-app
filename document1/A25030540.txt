ORDER 

Entitlement to service connection for primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a variant of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is granted. 

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on aid and attendance/housebound is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT 

1. The Veteran has a diagnosis of PLS, a variant of ALS, which developed after separation from service. 

2. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction's (AOJ) favorable finding for entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance/housebound has not been rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for PLS have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.318. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance/housebound have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1975 to October 1979. 

This matter comes before the Board on an October 2023 rating decision. In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence which was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for PLS, a variant of ALS, is granted. 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

There is a presumption of service connection for Veterans who develop ALS at any time after separation from service, unless (1) there is affirmative evidence it was not incurred in, or aggravated by, service; (2) there is affirmative evidence that it is due to the Veteran's willful misconduct; or (3) the Veteran did not have continuous active service of 90 days or more. 38 C.F.R. § 3.318. 

The Veteran contends his PLS warrants service connection on a presumptive basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.318. The Board agrees. 

The Veteran's enlistment examination reports normal results. His service treatment record reports no treatment for or diagnosis of PLS or ALS. 

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of PLS. In the October 2023 rating decision, the RO favorably found the Veteran was diagnosed with PLS in October 2023. The Board is bound by this favorable finding of fact as the record does not contain clear and unmistakable evidence to rebut it. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.801. 

A private medical opinion provided by the Veteran noted, "PLS is considered a variant of ALS, and people with [PLS] are considered true ALS patients." Thus, the Veteran's diagnosed PLS (a variant of ALS), warrants presumptive service connection unless barred by his own misconduct. 

Based on the evidence of record, affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds PLS is a variant of ALS. The Board further finds there is no affirmative evidence disqualifying the Veteran from presumptive service connection per 38 C.F.R. § 3.318(b). 

Accordingly, as the Veteran meets all requirements for presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.318, entitlement to service connection for PLS is granted. 

2. Entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance/housebound is granted. 

SMC, in pertinent part, is payable if, as the result of service-connected disabilities, a veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance from another person. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b). 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a), the following factors will be accorded consideration in determining whether a veteran is in need of regular aid and attendance of another person: (1) the inability of the veteran to dress or undress himself, or to keep himself ordinarily clean and presentable; (2) frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without such aid; (3) inability of the veteran to feed himself because of the loss of coordination of upper extremities or because of extreme weakness; and (4) inability to attend to the wants of nature; or incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the veteran from the hazards or dangers incident to his or her daily environment. It is not required that all of the disabling conditions enumerated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a) be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. The particular personal functions which a veteran is unable to perform should be considered in connection with his or her condition as a whole. It is only necessary that the evidence establish that a veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there is a constant need. Id. 

In the October 2023 rating decision, the RO favorably found that the Veteran required aid and attendance as he needed assistance with activities of daily living due to his PLS. The Board is bound by this favorable finding of fact as the record does not contain clear and unmistakable evidence to rebut it. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.801. 

As such, entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance/housebound is granted.
