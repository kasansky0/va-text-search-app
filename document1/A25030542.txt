ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating of 20 percent, but no higher, for neoplasm of the kidney (claimed as renal cell carcinoma) associated with herbicide exposure is granted.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 60 percent for eczema (claimed as atopic dermatitis) associated with herbicide exposure is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for neoplasm of the kidney (claimed as renal cell carcinoma) associated with herbicide exposure is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for eczema (claimed as atopic dermatitis) associated with herbicide exposure is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the period from August 10, 2022, the Veteran's neoplasm of the kidney (claimed as renal cell carcinoma) associated with herbicide exposure is manifested by daytime voiding interval between one and two hours and awakening to void three to four times per night.

2. The Veteran's eczema is rated as 60 percent disabling, which is the maximum schedular rating permitted for Diagnostic Code 7806, for dermatitis or eczema.

3. The Veteran's initial claim for service connection neoplasm of the kidney (claimed as renal cell carcinoma) associated with herbicide exposure was denied in a July 2012 rating decision. The Veteran did not submit a timely notice of disagreement, and the July 2012 rating decision became final.

4. The Veteran's claim to readjudicate service connection for neoplasm of the kidney (claimed as renal cell carcinoma) associated with herbicide exposure was received on February 22, 2023.

5. Thereafter, service connection for neoplasm of the kidney was granted and assigned the effective date of August 10, 2022. This claim was granted pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), effective August 10, 2022.

6. The Veteran's initial claim for service connection for eczema (claimed as atopic dermatitis) associated with herbicide exposure was denied in a July 2012 rating decision. The Veteran did not submit a timely notice of disagreement, and the July 2012 rating decision became final.

7. The Veteran's claim to readjudicate service connection for eczema (claimed as atopic dermatitis) associated with herbicide exposure was received on February 22, 2023.

8. Thereafter, service connection for eczema was granted and assigned the effective date of August 10, 2022. This claim was granted pursuant to the PACT Act, effective August 10, 2022.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1967 to March 1970. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the issues of entitlement to service connection for renal cell carcinoma and entitlement to service connection for atopic dermitis, most recently addressed in a July 2012 rating decision.  In May 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.  

In the June 14, 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on November 12, 2024, before the undersigned Veteran's Law Judge; a transcript is of record. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

This case has been advanced on the docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c).

1. Entitlement to an initial rating of 20 percent, but no higher, for neoplasm of the kidney (claimed as renal cell carcinoma) associated with herbicide exposure.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an initial compensable rating for neoplasm of the kidney. For the reasons that follow, the Veteran is entitled to an initial 20 percent rating, but no higher. 

The Veteran was assigned an initial noncompensable rating effective August 10, 2022, by way of a May 2023 rating decision. Therefore, the review period begins August 10, 2022. During that period the Veteran was afforded a March 2023 kidney conditions VA examination. There were no other VA or private medical records relevant to rating the Veteran's neoplasm of the kidney from the beginning of the review period until the close of the evidence window, the date of the rating decision on appeal, May 2023. The Veteran did provide relevant testimony during his November 2024 Board hearing testimony. 

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the Schedule For Rating Disabilities, which assigns ratings based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C.A. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Under DC 7528, a malignant neoplasm of the genitourinary system (i.e., prostate cancer) is assigned a 100 percent evaluation. However, a Note following that DC, explains that following the cessation of surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy, or other therapeutic procedure, the rating of 100 percent shall continue with a mandatory VA examination at the expiration of six months. Any change in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of section 3.105(e) of this chapter. If there has been no local reoccurrence or metastasis, rate on residuals as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528, Note.

Here, the March 2023 VA examination report shows that the Veteran had a malignant neoplasm of the kidney which was treated with surgery in 2009. The report shows that the Veteran is now is remission. In addition, at his November 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran denied recurrence of the malignant neoplasm of the kidney. Thus, the Veteran is to be rated on residuals as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant. 

The March 2023 VA examination report shows that the Veteran did not exhibit symptoms of renal dysfunction. Also, the Veteran did not testify to having such symptoms at his Board hearing, therefore, a rating based on renal dysfunction is not for application in the instant appeal.

Voiding dysfunction is rated based on urine leakage, urinary frequency, or obstructed voiding.

For urine leakage, the minimum 20 percent rating requires the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed less than 2 times per day. A 40 percent evaluation contemplates requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed 2 to 4 times per day. The maximum 60 percent rating contemplates requiring the wearing of an appliance or absorbent materials which must be changed more than 4 times per day. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

For urinary frequency, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for daytime voiding interval between two and three hours or awakening to void two times per night. A 20 percent rating is warranted for daytime voiding interval between one and two hours or awakening to void three to four times per night. A 40 percent rating is warranted for daytime voiding interval less than one hour or; awakening to void five or more times per night. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

For obstructed voiding, a noncompensable rating is assigned for obstructive symptomatology with or without stricture disease requiring dilation one to two times per year. A 10 percent rating is warranted for marked obstructive voiding with: (1) post void residuals greater than 150cc, (2) uroflowmetry; and markedly diminished flow rate (less than 10 cc/sec), (3) recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to obstruction, or (4) stricture disease requiring periodic dilation every two to three months. A 30 percent rating is warranted for obstructed voiding with urinary retention requiring intermittent or continuous catheterization. 

At his November 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he has to get up three to four times per night to void and that he can only go about two hours at most during the day without voiding. He also testified that he does not use absorbent materials. The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report readily observable symptoms of voiding dysfunction, and his testimony is found to be credible. Based on the Veteran's testimony of his urinary frequency he is entitled to a 20 percent rating for daytime voiding interval between one and two hours or awakening to void three to four times per night. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a. Further, the Board will liberally assume that the symptoms the Veteran reported at his November 2024 Board hearing were present since the beginning of the review period, the assigned effective date of August 10, 2022.

As the Veteran testified that he does not use absorbent materials, a higher rating for urine leakage is not for application. Additionally, the Veteran did not testify to having obstructed voiding in his hearing testimony and the evidence of record (i.e., VA and private medical records) does not otherwise show evidence of urinary obstruction. Thus, a higher rating is not for application for obstructed voiding. 

Based on the evidence of record above, and resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that a rating of 20 percent, but no higher, is warranted for neoplasm of the kidney, based on urinary frequency.

2. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 60 percent for eczema (claimed as atopic dermatitis) associated with herbicide exposure.

The Veteran is seeking a higher initial rating for eczema. For the reasons that follow, entitlement to a higher initial rating for eczema is denied. 

The Veteran's eczema is rated under Diagnostic Code 7806, for dermatitis or eczema.  

VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018.  These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after August 13, 2018.  

Effective August 13, 2018, a new General Rating Formula for the Skin applies to Diagnostic Codes 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Under this formula, a maximum 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: (1) characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or (2) constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.  Or rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DC's 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating for the Skin for DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824. 

Here, the evidence of record demonstrates that the predominant disability is eczema.  The March 2023 VA skin diseases examination report shows that the Veteran's eczema required constant or near constant topical corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications in the prior 12 months, with his eczema affecting approximately less than 5 percent of his total body area and less than 5 percent exposed area. No other symptoms were listed. 

As the Veteran is in receipt of the highest schedular rating under Diagnostic Code 7806, there is no basis to award a higher rating.  The Board has considered whether any other Diagnostic Codes related to disabilities of the skin would provide for a higher disability evaluation.  However, the evidence does not reflect that the Veteran's eczema disability would warrant a higher rating under a different diagnostic code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence is against the Veteran's claim of a rating in excess of 60 percent for eczema.

Earlier Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an award of a claim is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If a claim for disability compensation is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date of entitlement is the day following separation or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary of VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by the VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a). A "claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-5 (1998).

The effective date of an award of disability compensation based on new and relevant evidence received after a final disallowance shall be the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2). The effective date of an award of disability compensation based on a reopened claim under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109, 3.156, 3.157, and 3.160(e) shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r).

Where compensation is awarded pursuant to a liberalizing law or a liberalizing VA issue, the effective date of the award shall be fixed in accordance with facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the act or administrative issue. This exception applies to original and reopened claims, as well as claims for increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a). See also McCay v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 183, 187 (1996) (confirming that the plain language of section 5110(g) "prohibits a retroactive award prior to the effective date of the legislation"), aff'd, 106 F.3d 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

As relevant to this case, on August 10, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins (PACT) Act of 2022 (PACT Act). Significantly, a notable element of the PACT Act is that it broadens the requirements for the presumption of exposure to herbicide agents for establishing service connection for herbicide agent presumptive conditions, including the Veteran's claimed conditions. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168, § 403(d)(2) (2022). For claims filed within a year of the PACT Act, the earliest effective date assignable is also August 10, 2022. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for neoplasm of the kidney (claimed as renal cell carcinoma) associated with herbicide exposure.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for eczema (claimed as atopic dermatitis) associated with herbicide exposure.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection for eczema and neoplasm of the kidney (awarded disabilities). He has provided no arguments to support these contentions. 

The Veteran's February 2011 claims for service connection for the awarded disabilities were initially denied in a July 2012 rating decision. The Veteran did not submit a timely notice of disagreement and, therefore, the July 2012 rating decision became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103.

The record shows he filed a formal application to readjudicate the previously denied claim for service connection for the awarded disabilities on February 22, 2023, by way of VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application. 

Subsequently, in a May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ readjudicated the Veteran's claims and service connection for the awarded disabilities was granted pursuant to the PACT Act. Both awards were assigned the effective date of August 10, 2022, the date of the change in law.

Applying the applicable law, as outlined above, to the facts of the present case, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the assignment of an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for service connection for the awarded disabilities.

The law provides that, where compensation is awarded pursuant to any Act or administrative issue, the effective date shall not be earlier than the effective date of such Act or administrative issue. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g). The effective date of August 10, 2022, currently assigned, is the same date the PACT Act, upon which the grant of service connection for the awarded disabilities is based, went into effect. As the July 2012 rating decision became final, and as the Veteran filed his supplemental claim form on February 22, 2023, within one year of the enactment of the PACT Act, the earliest effective date assignable is August 10, 2022. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

In sum, as the supplemental claim for service connection for the awarded disabilities was not received until February 22, 2023, an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, (the date the PACT Act was signed) for the grant of service connection for the awarded disabilities is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114, 3.400.

Based on the liberalizing law of the PACT Act, the Board observes that the AOJ assigned the earliest possible effective date under the law for the grant of service connection for the awarded disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114. As the weight of the evidence is against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).
