DOCKET NO. 240402-430522
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 24, 2023, for the award of service connection for tinea versicolor is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's initial claim of service connection for tinea versicolor was received on January 24, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to January 24, 2023, for the award of service connection for tinea versicolor have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1978 to May 1982 and from February 1983 to March 1999.  

The case is on appeal from a June 2023 higher-level review decision which reconsidered evidence from a March 2023 rating decision.

In an April 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran selected the Direct Review option.  Therefore, the Board has considered the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 rating decision.

An effective date prior to January 24, 2023, for the award of service connection for tinea versicolor.

Legal Criteria

The effective date of an award based on an original claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  Within the context of a claim of service connection, the term "date entitlement arose" means the date the disability manifested.  McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28 (2000).  

A claimant may indicate a desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  If VA receives a complete application form appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  Portions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 have been found invalid, and supplemental claims are therefore not excluded from the intent to file provision.  Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110, 1147 (2021).

Only one complete claim for a benefit may be associated with each intent to file a claim for that benefit.  In the event multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within one year of an intent to file a claim for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii).

Procedural Background

The Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim for benefits in May 2022.  In July 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim appealing a previously denied claim of service connection for a psychiatric disorder.  On January 24, 2023, VA received the Veteran's claim for compensation for tinea versicolor.  The Veteran's representative submitted a statement with the January 2023 claim requesting that the claim be associated with the May 2022 intent to file. 

In a March 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for tinea versicolor, effective January 24, 2023.  The Veteran appealed the assigned effective date via a March 2023 request for higher-level review and the present Board appeal. 

Analysis

After a careful review of procedural history and facts relevant to the Veteran's claim, the Board finds no legal basis for an effective date prior to January 24, 2023.  The proper effective date of the Veteran's award of service connection is the date the Veteran's initial claim for benefits was received.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Veteran's representative contends that the May 2022 intent to file should be associated with the January 2023 claim for tinea versicolor, rather than the July 2022 supplemental claim, because the supplemental claim was not a "new claim for benefits."  See April 2024 NOD.  Unfortunately, this argument is not supported by law.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in invalidating portions 38 C.F.R. § 3.155, explicitly found that the intent to file provision does apply to supplemental claims.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy, 7 F.4th at 1147.  

Accordingly, under VA regulations, the May 2022 intent to file must be associated with the July 2022 supplemental claim.  When multiple complete claims are filed within one year of an intent to file, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii).  Therefore, because the July 2022 supplemental claim was received prior to the July 2023 claim, the supplemental claim must be associated with the intent to file.  Because no additional intent to file was received following the July 2022 supplemental claim, the Veteran's January 2023 claim for compensation is the earliest possible effective date for the award of service connection for tinea versicolor.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

The Board considered whether an earlier effective date would be warranted under regulations governing awards granted pursuant to liberalizing laws.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.  However, although the Veteran's claim was received within one year of the effective date of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (Aug. 10, 2022), the award of service connection was granted on direct basis, not pursuant to any provision of the PACT Act.  Thus, 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 does not provide an avenue for an earlier effective date. 

Therefore, the evidence is persuasively against the claim, and the benefit of the doubt doctrine is thus not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Accordingly, an effective date prior to January 24, 2023, for the award of service connection for tinea versicolor is not warranted.
