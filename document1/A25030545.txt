FINDING OF FACT

Reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses incurred on January 18, February 2, March 8, and March 9, 2021, was approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal is moot and must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1990 to May 1993.  This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from March 2021 decisions of the VA Veterans Health Administration that denied reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses incurred on January 18, February 2, March 8, and March 9, 2021.  The Veteran appealed in March 2021.

However, as reflected in October 2021 VA payment records, the agency of original jurisdiction subsequently readjudicated the Veteran's claims, approved payment, and paid the claimed beneficiary travel expenses incurred on January 18, February 2, March 8, and March 9, 2021.  The Veteran was notified of this in a June 2022 letter. 

Given this, there no longer remains a question for appellate consideration by the Board, and the appeal must be dismissed.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104(a), 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.
