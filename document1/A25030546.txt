ORDER

An initial disability rating of 10 percent for service-connected hypertension is granted.  

REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected hypertension is remanded.  

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence demonstrates that the Veteran has blood pressure readings reflecting systolic blood pressure of predominantly 160 or more.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial 10 percent rating for service-connected hypertension are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty for training in the United States Air Force September 1984 to December 1984 and then on active duty from September 1996 to October 2008.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In November 2023, the Veteran filed a Request for a Higher Level Review of the May 2023 rating decision.  In a March 2024 Higher Level Review rating decision, the RO continued the denial of the claim.  In April 2024, the Veteran perfected appeal to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), selecting Direct Review of the evidence by a Veterans Law Judge.  Thus, the Board will review evidence as of the date of the May 2023 rating decision.  

Increased Ratings

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an initial compensable rating for his service-connected hypertension.  

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity caused by a given disability.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  However, if different disability ratings are warranted for different periods of time over the life of a claim, "staged" ratings may be assigned.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).  

VA shall consider all information lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  To deny a claim on its merits, there must be a showing that the evidence is not in approximate balance and is persuasively against the Veteran's claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

An initial disability rating of 10 percent for service-connected hypertension is granted.  

The Veteran's hypertension is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104 DC 7101, hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension).  

Under 38 C.F.R § 4.104 DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is assigned for evidence of diastolic pressure predominately 100 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more; or, minimum evaluation for a history of diastolic blood pressure predominately 100 or more requiring continuous medication.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104 DC 7101.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for evidence of diastolic readings of predominantly 110 or more, or systolic readings of 200 or more.  Id.  A 40 percent rating is assigned for evidence of diastolic readings of predominantly 120 or more.  Id.  A 60 percent rating, the highest schedular rating allowed, is assigned for evidence of diastolic readings of predominantly of 130 or more.  Id.  Otherwise, a noncompensable, 0 percent rating is assigned.  Id.  

Under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.31, in every instance where the schedule does not provide for a 0 percent rating, such an evaluation will be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation have not been met.  

Upon review of the relevant evidence, the Board determines that an initial 10 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected hypertension is warranted.  Paramount, as will be discussed below, the Board finds that eleven blood pressure readings from the period on appeal reveal that the Veteran has a systolic pressure of predominantly 160 or more.  

Illustratively, a review of the medical record of evidence, reflects that the Veteran underwent a VA hypertension examination on December 21, 2022, at which time a diagnosis of hypertension was confirmed.  The examiner noted that the Veteran reported that the condition began in 2010 with no symptoms, but he has taken propranolol for the past eight years and stopped secondary to lower diastolic blood pressure readings.  The examiner noted that the Veteran has not restarted on therapy and that there are no current symptoms or medication treatment.  The examiner reported that the Veteran's treatment plan does not include taking continuous medication for hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension.  The examiner was unable to determine whether the Veteran's initial diagnosis was confirmed by blood pressure readings taken two or more times on a least three different days.  The examiner found that the Veteran does not have a history of diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more.  The examiner reported three blood pressure measurements of 158/94, 148/88 and 155/90.  The examiner found no other physical findings, complications, conditions, signs or symptoms or scars of the condition.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's condition does not impact his ability to work.  

A December 27, 2022 blood pressure reading documents three blood pressure readings of 178/104, 170/96 and 170/98.  

A December 28, 2022 blood pressure reading documents three blood pressure readings of 140/80, 160/86 and 130/80.  

A March 2023 primary care VA medical center treatment record (VATR) notes that the Veteran's blood pressure was elevated.  The record explains that the Veteran's highest blood pressure was at a compensation and pension evaluation was 162/95.  The provider notes that the Veteran was interested in starting blood pressure medication.  The record further reflects that the provider reported measured a blood pressure reading of 148/74.  

Here, the Board notes that the average of the eleven readings is 156/ 90.  

However, the criteria for a 10 percent rating for hypertension does not require an average of a of diastolic pressure of 100 or more or systolic pressure of 160 or more but requires a diastolic pressure of predominately 100 or more or systolic pressure of predominantly 160 or more.  38 C.F.R § 4.104 DC 7101.  Here, the Board highlights that the term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria.  Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common."  See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.  

After a review of all the lay and medical evidence, the Board finds that the evidence is in relative equipoise on the question of whether the Veteran's hypertension manifested to a systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.  Hence, the ultimate question is whether the Veteran's symptoms manifest to meet the criteria for a compensable 10 percent disability evaluation rating under DC 7101 for hypertension for the period on appeal.  The evidence demonstrates that during the period on appeal, the Veteran's hypertension was manifested by diastolic pressure ranging from 74 to 104 mm Hg and systolic pressure ranging from 130 to 178 mm Hg.  These dates detail that five of the eleven days record a systolic pressure of 160 or more.  Two of the eleven days detail a systolic pressure of 155 and 158.  The remaining four days detail systolic readings at 130, 140 and two days at 148.  

Accordingly, applying the rating principles at 38 C.F.R § 4.21 (it is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified the criteria for an increased), and resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, on the basis of the Veteran's prior treatment with medication and blood pressure readings taken two or more times on a least three different days, the Veteran's more common systolic readings for seven of the eleven days range from 155 to 178.  Thus, the Board finds that a rating of 10 percent for hypertension is approximated for the initial period on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R §§ 4.3. 4.7.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service connected hypertension is remanded.  

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system, remand is required only to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  As part of its duty to assist, VA is required to make reasonable efforts to assist a Veteran in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).  As part of the assistance provided, VA shall make reasonable efforts to obtain relevant private records that the claimant adequately identifies and VA will make as many requests as are necessary to obtain relevant records from a Federal department or agency.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  

The Board finds that such is the case with the current appeal.  Specifically, here, the record reflects that the Veteran has received treatment at primally at the Baltimore VA medical center (VAMC).  However, while the Board acknowledges that a July 2014 correspondence indicates that no Washington VATRs for the period of July 1, 2008 to August 5, 2008 exist, the Board finds that later, March 2023 Baltimore VATRs notes treatment at the Washington VAMC.  The May 2023 rating decision reflects that only the Baltimore VATRs were noted as reviewed prior to adjudication of the May 2023 rating decision.  However, the Board observes in this regard that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that VA is on constructive notice of all documents generated by VA, even if the documents have not been made part of the record in a claim for benefits.  See Bell v. Derwinski, 2?Vet. App.?611, 613 (1992).  

Hence, failure to obtain any outstanding treatment records prior to the adjudication of the May 2023 rating decision constituted a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand for correction.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain any outstanding VA and private treatment records that are not already associated with the claims file, including from Washington, D.C. VA medical center, in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  If any record identified cannot be obtained, the Veteran and his representative should be notified of this in writing, to include all efforts taken by VA to attempt to obtain any such record.  The Veteran should also be offered the option to provide any such record himself.
