ORDER

Service connection for shin splits is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for bronchial asthma is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that shin splints began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for shin splints are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1979 to March 1990 with prior service in the Reserve.  See Military Personnel Record at 52 (January 2024); Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (March 1990).

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in December 2023 and January 2024. In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. As the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for asthma for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the agency of original jurisdiction in the adjudication of those claims.

Service connection for shin splits

The Veteran seeks service connection for shin splints. He contends that shin splints began during basic training due to long road marches and running long distances and have persisted since. See C&P Exam (January 2024).

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Board concludes that the evidence of record does not establish that shin splints had onset during the Veteran's active service or within one year of separation or is otherwise related to an in-service event, injury, or disease.

December 2023 VA examination reflects a current diagnosis of bilateral shin splints and establishes current disability. See C&P Exam (January 2024).

Service treatment records (STRs) reflect no complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for bilateral shin splints. October 1984 and November 1987 Reports of Medical Examination (ROME) reflected normal examination of the bilateral lower extremities. See STR (November 2014). A September 1989 ROME on separation reflects the Veteran had iliotibial band contracture on the left which was repaired in August 1989 and continued to cause low back, left hip, and left knee pain. Id at 30. On his report of medical history at separation, the Veteran reported pain from the left hip to the left knee. Id at 36. Though the Veteran reported various conditions, he did not report shin splints on separation from service. Id. 

Shin splints are first noted in the record at a January 2015 VA examination. See C&P Exam (January 2015). Post-service medical records prior to and during the pendency of the appeal reflect no complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for bilateral shin splints. Rather, the only reports from the Veteran regarding shin splints and consideration of same by medical professionals are the January 2015 and December 2023 VA examinations and medical opinions.

A June 2012 VA examination report reflects no reports of shin splints by the Veteran. The examination report notes that the Veteran "does not have and has never had shin splints, stress fractures, chronic exertional compartment syndrome, or any other tibial and/or fibular impairment." See VA Examination (July 2012). At a January 2015 VA examination, the Veteran reported that shin splints caused pain "only when it's cold on walking." C&P Exam (January 2015).

On examination in December 2023, the Veteran reported that shin splints began during basic training and attributed symptoms to "long road marches and running long distances" in service. See C&P Exam (January 2024). Physical examination reflected mild shin splints with localized tenderness or pain on palpation to the bilateral shins, and no limitation of motion to the knees or ankles due to bilateral shin splints. The concurrent VAMO reflects that the disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in -service injury, event, or illness. As rationale, it is noted that there was no evaluation or treatment of shin splints in the STRs and no objective evidence of shin splints or pain below the knees following discharge from the service which negated his reports of continuity. See C&P Exam (January 2024).

The Board accepts that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms, their onset, progression and treatment history. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994). However, the Board finds that, to the extent that the Veteran reports in-service onset of shin splints and symptoms since service, his statements are not credible. For instance, (1) STRs reflect no complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for shin splints; (2) shin splints are first noted in the record in January 2015, over 25 years after separation from service, despite five prior claims for compensation for service-connected disability; (3) post-service medical treatment records document no complaints of or treatment for shin splints. The Board takes notice of the absence of corroborating evidence. An absence of corroborating evidence may factor into the Board's credibility analysis, so long as it is not the sole base for finding the appellant not credible. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the Board may "weigh the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence against the lay evidence of record," but "cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence"); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 ("The credibility of a witness can be impeached by a showing of interest."); Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (explaining that, although the Board "cannot ignore appellant's testimony simply because appellant is an interested party," it may take pecuniary interest into account when assessing the appellant's credibility). Here, contemporaneous medical evidence, in-service and post-service, as discussed above, go against the Veteran's assertion that shin splints had onset during active-duty service and have been chronic since.

The Board acknowledges that the January 2024 rating decision noted that the evidence showed that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service as service treatment records contained complaints of leg pain. However, the Board assigns great probative value to the many years intervening service and the first post-service documented findings or complaints of shin splints. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (2006). Also, the Board assigns greater probative value to the December 2023 VA medical opinion which is more probative than the Veteran's lay assertions. This is because it was prepared by a skilled, neutral medical professional after consideration of the Veteran's contentions and review of the claims file, and it is probative because it is supported by a complete rationale. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).

On balance, the weight of the evidence is against the claim.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

In remanding these matters, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions.  Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.  Indeed, the Board expressly defers a credibility determination in this appeal until the development has been completed to the extent feasible.

Entitlement to service connection for bronchial asthma

The Veteran seeks compensation for asthma he contends is due to service. He is currently compensated for service-connected bronchitis.

The Board finds that remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. Specifically, at the time of the rating decision on appeal, the VA medical examination was inadequate to decide this matter.

The March 2015 VA examiner was asked to opine whether the Veteran's asthma was due to "his duties in service in September 1989. See C&P Exam (March 2015). The scope of a Veteran's claim includes any disability that reasonably may be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). As the Veteran had over ten years of service and separated in September 1989, the Board finds that this directive was improperly narrow in scope and based on an inaccurate factual premise. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993). (A medical opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise is not probative.)

Service treatment records reflect the Veteran reported various instances of chest pain and shortness of breath throughout his time in service. The proper question is whether any diagnosed disability was incurred in or caused by service. As no VA examiner has addressed this question, the Board finds that remand is necessary to obtain another medical opinion in this matter. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the etiology of any respiratory disability other than chronic bronchitis. The claims file and a copy of this remand should be made available to and should be reviewed by the examiner.

1.  For each additional respiratory disorder identified, including asthma, the examiner must opine whether it is approximately at least as likely as not that such disability had its onset during or is otherwise etiologically related to the Veteran's active-duty service.

?

2. The opinion should identify and explain the relevance or significance, as appropriate, of any history, clinical findings, medical knowledge, or literature, etc., relied upon in reaching the conclusion(s).

NOTE: A negative medical opinion may not be predicated solely on the absence of documented in-service diagnosis, complaints, or findings.
