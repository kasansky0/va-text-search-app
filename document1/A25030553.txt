DOCKET NO. 240823-466179
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, her tinnitus is related to her active duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Louisiana Air National Guard from 1977 to 2007, based on the record before the Board, with active duty for training from August 1977 to November 1977, and September 2005 to December 2005.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

The Veteran appealed this decision and elected the direct review docket. By selecting the direct review docket, the Board must base its decision on the evidence that was before the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of the September 2023 decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

As an initial matter, this claim was previously denied in June 2023. The Veteran refiled this claim in August 2023, which was denied in the September 2023 rating decision currently on appeal. The decision found that new and relevant evidence was received, and the claim was adjudicated on the merits. As this constitutes a favorable finding, the Board will also proceed as if the claim has been reopened.

Service connection

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus. 

Generally, to establish service connection, a claimant must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

The term "veteran" means a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable. 38 U.S.C. § 101(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(d). A person seeking VA benefits must first establish that he or she has attained the status of Veteran. Holmes v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 38, 40 (1997).

Service connection for injuries and diseases can be considered for period of active duty for training (ADT) and only injuries can be considered for service connection for period of inactive duty for training (IDT).

To have basic eligibility for veterans' benefits based on a period of duty as a member of a state National Guard, a National Guardsman must have been ordered into Federal service by the President of the United States as proscribed in 10 U.S.C. § 12401 or must have performed full-time duty under the provisions of 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505. 38 C.F.R. § 3.6, 38 U.S.C. §§ 101. Service department records establish if and when a person was serving on active duty or active duty for training purposes. Cahall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 232, 237 (1994). Stated another way, "active duty" is defined as "full-time duty in the Armed Forces, other than active duty for training." 38 U.S.C. § 101(21); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(b)(1). While "Armed Forces" includes "the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard, including the reserve components thereof," the National Guard is only a reserve component "while in service of the United States." 10 U.S.C. § 10106; 38 U.S.C. § 101(10). Members of the National Guard are not in active Federal service except when ordered thereto under law pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 12401. Whereas "active duty for training" (ADT) for members of the National Guard means "full-time duty under section 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 of title 32." 38 U.S.C. § 101(22)(C).

As shown above, the Veteran was a member of the Louisiana Air National Guard from 1977 to 2007, with active duty for training from August to November 1977, and September to December 2005.

A Veteran is presumed sound when no preexisting conditions are noted upon entry. For periods of ADT, the presumption of soundness does not apply unless noted on a pre-deployment examination. Here, there is no pre-deployment examination of record. The Veteran has not asserted, and the service treatment records do not demonstrate that the condition started in service. Rather, she asserted that it began sometime between 2013 and 2018. 

The Veteran's occupational specialty was Personnel specialist, which the RO determined that there was a low probability of hazardous noise exposure. See September 2023 decision. 

The Veteran described ringing in her ears and frequent exposure to noise trauma, to include heavy vehicles, generators and weaponry. See February 2023 Statement in support of claim. The Board recognizes that tinnitus is a disability that a layperson may be competent to self-diagnose, because "ringing in the ears is capable of lay observation." Charles v. Principi. 16 Vet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002). Thus, a current disability has been established and an in-service event has been credibly described. The remaining question is whether there is a causal relationship between the two.

In March 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA hearing loss and tinnitus examination. At that time, the Veteran described bilateral ringing that pinged back and forth, occurring once a month and lasting less than 30 seconds. The Veteran also reported that it bothered her more in the beginning and she felt she had "gotten used to it." She stated that the symptoms started between five and ten years prior, thus indicating that they started between 2013 and 2018. The examiner concluded that the Veteran did not meet the Dauman and Tyler diagnostic criteria for tinnitus which included that the noise must last at least five minutes and occur at least two times per week. 

In support of her claim, the Veteran submitted a statement from Ms. D.L., a certified nurse practitioner. The clinician reviewed the Veteran's treatment records and reported symptomology and determined that the Veteran did have a current tinnitus diagnosis. The nurse also concluded that the Veteran's tinnitus was at least as likely as not due to or related to acoustic trauma during active service.

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance regarding the question of whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to her service. Given the medical opinion, and the fact that a veteran's submitted lay statements may be sufficient evidence in any claim for service connection, the benefit of the doubt must be given to the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).
