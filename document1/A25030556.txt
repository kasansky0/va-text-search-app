REMANDED

Entitlement to an annual clothing allowance for calendar year 2020 is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from September 2012 to July 2016.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2020 decision by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) that denied entitlement to a clothing allowance for calendar year 2020. In August 2020, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket. 

The record is missing a significant amount of documentation concerning a clothing allowance for calendar year 2020. The claims file does not contain a copy of the initial claims application, any applicable notice letters, VHA prosthetics records, or any pre-decisional evidence submitted or developed in relation to the claim. The substantive decision by the VHA is also missing from the claims file. 

As these pertinent documents are missing from the file, the Board does not have a complete record on which basis it can fulfill its statutory and regulatory duty to render a decision on the Veteran's claim. Therefore, remand is warranted for the AOJ to reconstruct the record and associate with the claims file all relevant clothing allowance records. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the electronic claim file all evidence considered in connection with the claim on appeal.

The record should include (but is not limited to): the Veteran's application for a clothing allowance for 2020, the associated 2020 VHA decision, and any other relevant documents received or generated in connection with the claim, to include any VHA or prosthetics records.

2. If any such records are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability and provide the appellant with notice of the unavailability of records.
