ORDER

An initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent for left shoulder arthritis and impingement syndrome rotator cuff arthropathy is denied. 

REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 18, 2013 for an award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability as a result of service-connected disabilities (TDIU), to include referral for extraschedular consideration.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 18, 2013 for an award of basic eligibility to Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's left shoulder disability does not more nearly approximate ankylosis or the functional equivalent thereof, impairment of the humerus, impairment of the clavicle or scapula, or flexion and/or abduction limited to 25 degrees from the side.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent for left shoulder arthritis and impingement syndrome rotator cuff arthropathy are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2018); 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5201 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1976 to November 1979.

This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2023 higher-level review (HLR) decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In May 2022, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim requesting readjudication of the issues on appeal, most recently addressed in a June 2021 rating decision.  In October 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  In April 2023, the Veteran requested HLR review of the October 2022 decision.  In July 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2022 decision and granted an earlier effective date of June 18, 2013 for TDIU and DEA, and denied an earlier effective date for service connection for the left shoulder. 

In his June 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the October 2022 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  Because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to an earlier effective date for a TDIU and basic eligibility to DEA benefits, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent for left shoulder arthritis and impingement syndrome rotator cuff arthropathy

The Veteran claims an increased rating for his left shoulder disability.

Service connection for a left shoulder disability was granted by an August 2019 Board decision.  In implementing this decision, a March 2020 rating decision assigned an initial 20 percent rating effective February 24, 2016.  In a March 2021 HLR request, the Veteran disputed both the assigned rating and effective date.  A May 2021 HLR decision denied an earlier effective date but found an error in fulfilling VA's duty to assist and transferred the claim for an increased rating to the supplemental claim decision review option for additional development.  A June 2021 rating decision denied an increased rating.  The Veteran subsequently submitted the May 2022 supplemental claim giving rise to this appeal.  The Board notes that this supplemental claim and the April 2023 request for HLR also sought readjudication of the Veteran's effective date.  His June 2024 notice of disagreement, however, did not identify an earlier effective date for service connection for a left shoulder disability as an issue on appeal, and as such the Board will not address it further.

Disability evaluations are determined by application of the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  An evaluation of the level of disability present must also include consideration of the functional impairment of the Veteran's ability to engage in ordinary activities, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  Consideration must also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a [or 4.73] criteria.").  Moreover, joint testing is to be conducted on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint. Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158, 170 (2016).  VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the claimants themselves when a flare-up or repeated use over time is not observable at the time of examination.  Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45 permit consideration of ankylosis ratings if a claimant's functional loss is the functional equivalent of ankylosis.  See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021).

The Board is to take due consideration that the beneficial effects of medication are discounted in assessing musculoskeletal ratings as such effects are not contemplated therein and, therefore, taking medication may make a claimant appear less disabled than in reality.  Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798 (Mar. 12, 2025).

During the pendency of the appeal, the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended effective February 7, 2021.  85 Fed. Reg. 76,453 (Nov. 30, 2020).  If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the claimant will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change.  38 U.S.C. § 5110.  Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claim under the old criteria prior to February 7, 2021 and both the old and new rating criteria from February 7, 2021.  The criteria that is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied.

When a question arises as to which of two ratings apply under a particular diagnostic code, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).

The Veteran's VA examinations indicate that he is right-handed.  As such, the criteria below are those for the nondominant extremity.

The Veteran's left shoulder impingement is evaluated for limitation of motion under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5201.  Under this code, limitation of motion of the arm is rated at 20 percent when limited to shoulder level or to midway between the side and shoulder level.  When motion is limited to 25 degrees from the side, a 30 percent rating is warranted in the nondominant extremity. 

Alternative and additional Diagnostic Codes for the shoulder and arm are available as described below.  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5200, ankylosis of scapulohumeral articulation in the nondominant extremity is rated at 20 percent for favorable, with abduction to 60 degrees and the ability to reach the mouth and head; at 30 percent for intermediate between favorable and unfavorable; and at 40 percent for unfavorable, with abduction limited to 25 degrees from the side.  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5202, ratings are available for impairment of the humerus.  In the nondominant extremity, a 20 percent rating is warranted for malunion of the humerus with moderate or marked deformity or for infrequent or frequent episodes of dislocation of the humerus at the scapulohumeral joint with guarding at shoulder level.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for fibrous union of the humerus.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for nonunion of the humerus (false flail joint).  A 70 percent rating is warranted for loss of head of the humerus (flail shoulder).  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5203, ratings are available for impairment of the clavicle or scapula.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for malunion of the clavicle or scapula or for nonunion of the clavicle or scapula without loose movement.  A 20 percent evaluation is warranted for nonunion of the clavicle or scapula with loose movement or for dislocation of the clavicle or scapula.

Normal range of motion of the shoulder is flexion and abduction from zero to 180 degrees, and internal and external rotation each to 90 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate I.  Abduction is the motion of lifting the arm from the side, with zero degrees representing the arm at the side and 90 degrees representing the arm at the shoulder level.  Id.  

Amendments to Diagnostic Code 5201, effective February 7, 2021, clarify that limitation of motion of the arm to shoulder level is equivalent to flexion and/or abduction limited to 90 degrees and limitation of motion to midway between side and shoulder level is equivalent to flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5201 (effective February 7, 2021).

Any limitation of motion of a single arm at the shoulder joint constitutes a single disability, regardless of the number of planes in which the arm's motion is limited.  See Yonek v. Shinseki, 722 F.3d 1355, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  An evaluation under Diagnostic Code 5201 prior to the amendment is only available for limitation of motion in shoulder flexion or abduction and not for limitation of motion in shoulder rotation.  Estevez v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 157, 168 (2023).

VA treatment records reflect that at a February 2016 physical therapy consultation the Veteran reported that his shoulder was doing well if he did not overdo his activities.  He was able to move his shoulder in full range of motion.  He was diagnosed with left shoulder arthritis.  In April 2017 he reported shoulder pain and requested medication.

In a February 2018 affidavit, the Veteran reported daily shoulder pain rated 8-9/10 and radiating to his neck.  He stated that he could lift his arms above his head, but only for a few seconds due to pain.  He described restricting lifting to things that are less than 10 pounds.  He stated that he tried medications and exercises, but nothing was able to successfully relieve his pain.

The Veteran submitted a May 2018 evaluation by a private physician based on review of the record and interview with the Veteran.  He reported progressively worsening pain when he attempted to use his left upper extremity at chest level or higher.  He described extremely painful abduction and tried to avoid such movement at chest level or higher.  The physician opined that it was least as likely as not that the Veteran had only 25 degrees of active abduction without pain, with additional loss of function based on weakened movement.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in June 2021.  He reported that he was unable to move his shoulder at times due to pain.  He described moderate flare-ups occurring daily, lasting all day and all night.  He stated that he was unable to lift overhead or move shoulders.  Flexion and abduction were limited to 70 degrees, and internal and external rotation were limited to 45 degrees.  Pain was noted in all ranges of active and passive motion.  There was no objective evidence of crepitus or pain on palpation.  Repetitive testing did not lead to additional loss of function or range.  The examiner determined that procured evidence did not suggest additional functional limitation with repeated use over time.  The examiner found that flare-ups caused the functional equivalent of limitation of flexion and abduction to 60 degrees and internal and external rotation to 35 degrees.  There was no muscle atrophy, ankylosis, instability, dislocation, labral pathology, or impairment of the humerus.  Hawkins' impingement test and the empty can test were positive.  He was diagnosed with left shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff arthropathy.

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in May 2022.  He reported constant left shoulder pain that interfered with his sleep.  He treated his pain with Lortab and stated that it sometimes has no effect.  He stated that he was unable to lift more than 20 pounds.  Flare-ups were described as mild to severe, occurring three times per week and lasting one hour or so.  Flexion and abduction were limited to 70 degrees.  Internal rotation was full to 90 degrees.  External rotation was limited to 60 degrees.  Pain was noted in all ranges of active and passive motion except internal rotation.  There was no objective evidence of crepitus or pain on palpation.  Repetitive testing further reduced flexion and abduction to 65 degrees.  The examiner determined that procured evidence did not suggest additional functional limitation with repeated use over time.  The examiner found that flare-ups caused the functional equivalent of limitation of flexion and abduction to 65 degrees.  There was no muscle atrophy, ankylosis, instability, dislocation, labral pathology, or impairment of the humerus.  Hawkins' impingement test, the empty can test, and the external rotation strength test were positive.  He was diagnosed with left shoulder arthritis and impingement syndrome with rotator cuff arthropathy.

The Board finds that an initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's left shoulder disability.  Higher or additional ratings are available for ankylosis or the functional equivalent thereof, impairment of the humerus, impairment of the clavicle or scapula, or flexion or abduction limited to 25 degrees from the side, to include consideration of additional functional loss following repeated use over time and during flare-ups.  The evidence persuasively weighs against such findings.  There is no evidence of ankylosis, impairment of the humerus, or impairment of the clavicle or scapula. His flexion and abduction have not been measured as limited to less than 65 degrees.  The June 2021 and May 2022 VA examiners respectively determined that flare-ups would reduce flexion and abduction to 60 and 65 degrees, and the June 2021 examiner determined that flare-ups would reduce external rotation to 35 degree.  While the May 2018 private examiner estimated that he had painful motion beginning at 25 degrees, this finding is less probative as it was based on review of the records and interview without any physical examination of the Veteran.  Moreover, the finding appears inconsistent with the reports of the Veteran at the same interview, where he reported pain with movement at chest level or higher. 

While neither examiner made specific findings as to the effect of medication, the examiners both used procured evidence to determine limitation of motion during flare-ups, which the Board understands to be a description of the Veteran's symptoms at their worst, satisfying the concerns of Ingram.  In addition, the Veteran stated in February 2018 that medication did not relieve his pain, and at his May 2022 examination he stated that half the time it had no effect at all.  For these reasons, the Board finds that an initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's left shoulder disability.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 18, 2013 for an award of a TDIU

The Veteran claims an earlier effective date for his TDIU. Specifically, he maintains that an effective date of "at least August 1, 2011."

The issue of entitlement to a TDIU was remanded by an August 2019 Board decision as an intertwined issue and with instruction that, if, after completion of the other ordered development and implementation of the granted issues, the Veteran did not meet the eligibility threshold for a schedular TDIU, the issue should be referred for extraschedular consideration.  On remand, a March 2020 rating decision granted a TDIU and assigned an effective date of March 21, 2018.  The Veteran requested HLR of this effective date in March 2021.  A May 2021 HLR decision found an error in fulfilling VA's duty to assist and transferred the claim for an increased rating to the supplemental claim decision review option for additional development.  A June 2021 rating decision denied an earlier effective date.  The Veteran subsequently submitted the May 2022 supplemental claim giving rise to this appeal.  The October 2022 rating decision denied an earlier effective date, but the July 2023 HLR decision on appeal granted an effective date of June 18, 2013, partially granting the Veteran's claim.

Generally, the effective date of an award of an increased rating is the date of receipt of a claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  A claim date may be maintained by?continuously pursuing?a claim or issue via supplemental claim, request for HLR, appeal to the Board, or appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC), provided such options are timely exercised within one year of the issuance of the decision.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  For supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision, the effective date will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.? 38 C.F.R. §?3.2500(h)(2).

On August 1, 2011, the Veteran submitted a claim of service connection for multiple disabilities, including a back disability and a right ankle disability.  A May 2013 legacy rating decision granted service connection for a back disability and a right ankle disability, assigning 10 percent ratings to each effective August 1, 2011.  He submitted a supplemental claim in June 2013, less than one month later, claiming increased ratings, and underwent VA examinations in April 2014.  He also submitted a claim for a TDIU in September 2013.  A May 2014 rating decision denied increased ratings, and the Veteran submitted a timely legacy notice of disagreement in July 2014.  In pursuing this appeal, the Veteran's representative made a May 2018 submission raising the issue of a TDIU as intertwined under Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453 (2009).  The August 2019 Board decision remanded the issue of entitlement to a TDIU.

The Board finds that the Veteran's claim date for his TDIU claim is August 1, 2011, the date VA received his earliest compensation claim.  The claim was initially denied by the May 2013 rating decision, the finality of which was abrogated by the receipt of new and material evidence during the one year appeal period, including the June 2013 supplemental claim and the April 2014 VA examinations.  The subsequent May 2014 rating decision was appealed, and the Veteran's TDIU was granted in a March 2020 rating decision after his claim was remanded by the August 2019 Board decision.  The question before the Board is thus whether entitlement to a TDIU arose between August 1, 2011 and June 18, 2013.

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a). The service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue will be addressed in both instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a), (b).

If there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, with sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a). 

The Board finds that remand is necessary to ensure that the instructions of the August 2019 Board decision have been fully complied with.  From August 1, 2009 to June 18, 2013, the Veteran was in receipt of a 20 percent rating for a back injury and a 10 percent rating for a right ankle sprain.  His combined schedular rating is therefore 30 percent, and he does not meet the eligibility threshold for a schedular TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  The next question before the Board would normally be whether there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran is unemployable based on his service-connected disabilities to warrant referral to the Director, Compensation Service for consideration of entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis in the first instance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (b); Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019); Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1 (2021).

The Board, however, already instructed that the Veteran's TDIU claim be referred for extraschedular consideration in its August 2019 decision.  While at the time of the Board decision, the Veteran's combined rating never exceeded 30 percent, the Board considered his argument that he was rendered unemployable by his back and right ankle disabilities alone.  As such, the Board finds that the grant of a TDIU effective June 18, 2013 did not remove the AOJ's obligation to refer the remainder of the period on appeal for extraschedular consideration under the instructions of the August 2019 remand.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).  Remand is therefore necessary to cure this pre-decisional duty to assist error.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 18, 2013 for an award of basic eligibility to DEA benefits

The Veteran claims an earlier effective date for his award of basic eligibility to DEA benefits.  Educational assistance under Chapter 35 is generally payable to a dependent of a veteran who has a total disability permanent in nature resulting from a service-connected disability.? 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021.  The Veteran is currently eligible for DEA benefits effective June 18, 2013.  His eligibility was granted in conjunction with his TDIU.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative have contended that DEA benefits are warranted absent a grant of a TDIU or other rating raising his combined schedular rating to 100 percent.  The Board therefore finds that as this issue is inextricably intertwined with the Veteran's TDIU claim, it too must be remanded.  See Ephraim v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 549, 550 (1993) (inextricably intertwined claims should be remanded together).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Refer the Veteran's claim for a TDIU from August 1, 2011 to June 18, 2013 to the Director of the Compensation Service for consideration of whether an extraschedular TDIU is warranted for that period.
