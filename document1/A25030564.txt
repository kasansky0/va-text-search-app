ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability was manifested by no worse than level II hearing loss in the right ear and level I hearing loss in the left ear.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1992 to July 1993.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO).  On the Decision Review Request Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) VA Form 10182, received in July 2024, the Veteran requested a Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  In this regard, the Board notes that under the direct review option, no additional evidence received after the appealed rating decision is to be considered; rather, review is limited to the evidence on record at the time of the decision.

The Board notes that in December 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996 and requested, in pertinent part, higher-level review of the February 2024 rating decision as it pertained to the assigned rating for his service-connected bilateral hearing loss.  However, he did not submit a request to withdraw his July 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), and therefore, the appeal remains before the Board.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  The basis of disability ratings is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body, to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Id. 

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that particular rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, that reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

For the entire appeal period, such disability has been evaluated as noncompensably disabling pursuant to Diagnostic Code 6100. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

In this regard, ratings of hearing loss range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of speech discrimination tests combined with the average hearing threshold levels as measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second.  To rate the degree of disability for service-connected hearing loss, the Rating Schedule has established eleven auditory acuity levels, designated from Level I, for essentially normal acuity, through Level XI, for profound deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85(h), Table VI.  In order to establish entitlement to a compensable rating for hearing loss, it must be shown that certain minimum levels of the combination of the percentage of speech discrimination loss and average pure tone decibel loss are met.  The assignment of disability ratings for hearing impairment is derived by a mechanical application of the Rating Schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are rendered.  Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992). 

The criteria for rating hearing impairment use controlled speech discrimination tests (Maryland CNC) together with the results of pure tone audiometry tests.  These results are then charted on Table VI, or Table VIA in exceptional cases as described in 38 C.F.R. § 4.86, and Table VII, as set out in the Rating Schedule.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85.  An exceptional pattern of hearing loss occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 frequencies is 55 decibels or more, or when the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran filed a service connection claim for bilateral hearing loss on September 27, 2023.  That claim was granted in the February 2024 rating decision and assigned a noncompensable evaluation effective September 7, 2024.  The Veteran has appealed the initial rating assigned.

The evidence of record includes a February 2024 VA examination report.  The Veteran reported being told by his spouse that he could not always hear.  Speech recognition scores were 88 percent for the right ear and 92 percent for the left ear.  The examiner noted the following audiometric testing results:

	HERTZ

	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	30	35	40	55

LEFT	35	35	40	50

These findings correlate to a designation of level II for the right ear, and level I for the left ear pursuant to Table VI.  Applying the percentage ratings for hearing impairment in Table VII, these results correspond to a noncompensable rating.  No exceptional pattern of hearing loss was shown.

In his July 2024 NOD, the Veteran stated that his doctor told him he had substantial hearing loss.

After a review of the evidence of record, based on the valid audiometric examination conducted during the appeal period, the Board finds that a compensable rating is not warranted.

The Board emphasizes that disability ratings for hearing impairment are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are rendered.  Lendenmann, 3 Vet. App. 345.  Therefore, during the appeal period, the currently assigned non-compensable evaluation accurately reflects the Veteran's disability picture as contemplated under the rating criteria.  To the extent the Veteran may argue or suggest that clinical data supports an increased disability rating, such as impaired speech discrimination while communicating, or that the rating criteria should not be employed, he is not competent to make that assertion.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay persons not competent to diagnose cancer).  As indicated, the rating of hearing loss disabilities requires the administration of audiometric testing that is administered and interpreted by a professional.

Additionally, the Board has considered the Veteran's report that his spouse told him that he could not always hear and that his doctor told him he had substantial hearing loss.  In Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that the rating criteria for hearing loss contemplate the functional effects of decreased hearing and difficulty understanding speech in an everyday work environment as these are the effects that VA's audiometric tests are designed to measure.  The Veteran has not otherwise described functional effects that are considered exceptional, or that are not otherwise contemplated by the assigned evaluation.  Id.  Thus, his complete disability picture is considered under the rating schedule.

The Board has also considered whether staged ratings are appropriate for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss; however, the Board finds his symptomatology has been stable throughout the appeal period. Therefore, assigning staged ratings for such disability is not warranted.  

In sum, the competent evidence of record shows the Veteran had no worse than level II hearing acuity in the right ear and level I hearing acuity in the left ear during the appeal period.  Applying the percentage ratings for hearing impairment in Table VII, such results in a noncompensable rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.  Consequently, the evidence of record is persuasively against any increased rating during the appeal period, and the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).
