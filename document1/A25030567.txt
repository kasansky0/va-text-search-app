ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder pain is dismissed as moot.

FINDING OF FACT

An October 2024 rating decision granted service connection for right shoulder strain, claimed as right shoulder pain, and there is no remaining case or controversy pertaining to the Veteran's claim for service connection for right shoulder pain.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for right shoulder pain have been met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from May 2015 to May 2019.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2023 under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), and denied entitlement to service connection for right shoulder pain.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder pain is dismissed as moot.

The Veteran appealed a June 2024 rating decision that denied service connection for right shoulder pain.

While the appeal was pending before the Board, the AOJ issued an October 2024 rating decision that granted service connection for right shoulder strain, claimed as right shoulder pain.

As the grant of service connection represents a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal, the Board finds there is no case or controversy pertaining to the Veteran's claim of service connection for right shoulder pain. Accordingly, the appeal as to the issue presently before the Board is dismissed as moot. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997).
