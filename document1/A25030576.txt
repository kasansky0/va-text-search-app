ORDER

The issue of entitlement to an apportionment of the Veteran's VA compensation benefits to the Appellant on her own behalf is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A November 18, 2021 decision denied an apportionment of the Veteran's VA compensation benefits to the Appellant on her own behalf.

2. On January 28, 2022, the Board received the Appellant's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (hereinafter NOD), which was post-marked January 21, 2022, requesting review of the November 18, 2021 apportionment decision on the Board's Direct Review Docket.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Appellant's January 28, 2022 NOD was not timely, and, therefore, an appeal of the November 18, 2021 apportionment decision has not been properly initiated.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 7105A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104(c), 20.402.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1974 to March 1976 and December 1976 to December 1977.  The Appellant is the Veteran's wife.  See June 2012 Marriage Certificate received July 9, 2012. 

The apportionment decision on appeal was issued on November 18, 2021 and constitutes an initial decision of the issue of the Appellant's apportionment claim.  On her January 28, 2022 NOD, the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Nevertheless, the Appellant's NOD was not timely as it was received more than 60 days after the issuance of the November 18, 2021 apportionment decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.402 ("[i]n simultaneously contested claims, the Notice of Disagreement from the person adversely affected must be filed within 60 days from the date of mailing of the notification of the determination").  The Board notes that the 60-day appeal period in this case expired on January 17, 2022, which was a Monday.

Although the Board may not dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction due to an untimely NOD, it may dismiss the appeal due to non-jurisdictional reasons, such as a procedural defect, where the claimant did not substantially comply with proper claims processing rules.  See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (stating VA can require a claimant to fill out a particular form and can dismiss nonconforming or untimely filings but a failure to follow claims processing rules does not affect the Board's jurisdiction).

The Board acknowledges the NOD was signed on January 14, 2022, which is prior to the expiration of the 60-day appeal period.  Nevertheless, it is clearly post-marked January 21, 2022.  See January 18, 2022 VA Form (containing a post-mark date of January 21, 2022).  As it was mailed and received after the expiration of the appeal period, it cannot be construed as timely. 

In the present case, the Appellant did not comply with the claims processing rules despite being properly notified of her appellate rights.  See  November 18, 2021 decision (notifying the Appellant she had "60 days from the date of this letter to seek further review).  The Appellant has not presented any reason for the untimely submission of her NOD that would serve as good cause to extend the filing deadline.  Moreover, the present matter involves a simultaneously contested claim and such a waiver of applicable claims processing rules could be prejudicial to the other claimant.  As good cause has not been shown, and the Appellant's NOD was untimely, a dismissal of the appeal based on the failure to substantially comply with the mandatory claim processing rules is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 20.402.

The Board is cognizant the parties were not sent letters in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c).  Nevertheless, 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c) pertains to "potential jurisdictional defects."  Given the Court's holding in Ferko, that an untimely NOD "is not a jurisdictional bar" but a "nonjurisdictional claim-processing rule," the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c) are not applicable.  See Ferko, supra. 

In sum, the NOD was untimely because it was received more than 60 days after the issuance of the apportionment decision the Appellant sought to appeal.  Therefore, the appeal is dismissed due to the Appellant's failure to substantially comply with mandatory claim processing rules.
