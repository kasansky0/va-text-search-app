ORDER

The appeal seeking entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided on November 11, 2020 is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

A VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) was received from a billing company that did not furnish the underlying non-VA medical services in question.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

A properly completed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), requesting Board review of the issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on November 11, 2020, has not been received; the appeal is dismissed.  38?U.S.C. §?7105; 38?C.F.R. §§?20.202, 20.204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1975 to March 1981.  He died in 2023.  The Appellant in this matter is Benefit Recovery (and not the Veteran or the non-VA medical facility that provided treatment to the Veteran).

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 13, 2021 VA Veterans Health Administration (VHA) decision letter.  On September 28, 2021, VA received a VA Form 10182 in which the Appellant selected the Direct Review lane.  Therefore, the Board's review is limited to evidence on record at the time of the July 13, 2021 decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The appeal seeking entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-VA medical services provided on November 11, 2020 is dismissed.

The November 11, 2020 episode of care was denied because no authorization number was submitted with the claim.  See July 13, 2021 VHA decision letter.  On September 28, 2021, VA received a VA Form 10182 that was signed by an employee of Benefit Recovery.  Notably, the individual listed the Benefit Recovery mailing address, email address, and telephone number.

The Board finds Benefit Recovery is not a proper claimant that may file a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement.  38?C.F.R. §?20.204 (a Notice of Disagreement may be filed by a claimant or by his or her representative if a proper Power of Attorney is on record or accompanies such Notice of Disagreement).  Moreover, Benefit Recovery is not an accredited representative of the Veteran or the health care provider.  See 38?C.F.R. §§?14.627, 14.629.  "Claimant" is generally defined under VA regulations as a person who filed a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA.  38?C.F.R. §?20.3(f), (g).  Under Part 17 of the regulations, claimants for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical services for unauthorized emergency treatment may include the veteran who received the services; the hospital, clinic, or community resource which provided the services; or a person other than the veteran who paid for the services.  38?C.F.R. §?17.123.

When viewed in context of authorized non-VA medical services, health care providers include entities authorized to furnish medical services to covered veterans that enter into bid contracts to establish networks of health care providers. See generally 38?U.S.C. §?1703(c), (h); 38?C.F.R. §§?17.4005, 17.4030.  There is no indication under the applicable law and regulations that a non-veteran entity that did not furnish the underlying medical services may be considered a claimant.

The record does not reflect that Benefit Recovery is a health care provider as described in the regulations or that Benefit Recovery provided the underlying treatment on November 11, 2020, associated with a claim for payment for the authorized non-VA medical services.  

The Board finds the September 28, 2021 VA Form 10182 filed by Benefit Recovery did not properly initiate appellate review under the Appeals Modernization Act.  38?U.S.C. §?7105(a), (b)(2)(A) (notices of disagreement shall be in writing, shall identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees, and may be filed by the claimant, the claimant's legal guardian, or such accredited representative, attorney, or authorized agent as may be selected by the claimant or legal guardian); 38?C.F.R. §§?20.202(a), 20.204.  

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
