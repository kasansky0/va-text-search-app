ORDER

Service connection for migraine headaches is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

The probative evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's migraine headaches are causally related to service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for the establishment of service connection for migraine headaches have been met.?38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b);?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.310.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1986 to December 2006. This matter comes before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).? 

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), seeking?direct?review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). Under?Direct?Review, all evidence available at the time of the decision on appeal is considered.? 

Service connection for migraine headaches is granted.

Legal Criteria

Service?connection may be granted for disability arising from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active?service.?38 U.S.C. § 1131;?38 C.F.R. § 3.303?(a).?Service?connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to?service, establishes that the disease was incurred in?service.?38 C.F.R. § 3.303?(d). As a general matter,?service?connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in?service, and (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during?service. 

Service?connection?can also be established on the basis of?continuation?of symptomatology.?Continuity?of symptomatology may be shown by demonstrating "(1) that a condition was 'noted' during?service?or any applicable presumption period; (2) evidence of post-service?continuity?of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service?symptomatology." Barr v. Nicholson,?21?Vet. App.?303, 307?(2007). 

Factual Background

The Veteran reported headaches during service. See May 1994 in-service entry. The Veteran's service treatment records also indicate that he later took over-the-counter medication to treat his headaches over a five-day period. See November 1997 entry

The Veteran was afforded an August 2007 VA examination within one year after exiting from service during which he reported having headaches.

The Veteran was diagnosed with severe headaches at a January 2009 medical treatment. The Veteran was prescribed medication to treat his headaches. See March 2009 medical treatment. 

The Veteran was afforded a September 2022 VA examination during which he reported a several-year history of headaches that occur every morning upon first awakening. The conducting examiner indicated that the Veteran's headaches are associated with photophobia, dizziness, visual changes, and paresthesias. 

The Veteran was then afforded a November 2022 VA examination during which the conducting physician opined that it was less likely than not that his headaches were causally related to service. As a rationale, the physician stated that there were only two mentions of headache complaints during service. The physician opined that the Veteran's headaches were acute, transient conditions that resolved without sequelae or residual disability. 

Analysis

The record indicates that the Veteran has a diagnosis of headaches. Accordingly, the first element of service connection has been met. 

The record also indicates that the Veteran reported headaches several times during service. As such, the second element of service connection has been met. 

What remains for consideration is whether the Veteran's headaches are causally related to his military service. 

Here, the Board finds the Veteran to be competent and credible to report that his headaches have persisted since service. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board acknowledges that the November 2022 VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's headaches were causally related to service. However, the Board finds the opinion to be inadequate because the examiner relied on the absence of evidence in service treatment records for the opinion. See Dalton v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (finding that an examination is inadequate where the examiner relied on lack of evidence in service treatment records to provide a negative opinion).

Accordingly, the Board finds that the probative evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's migraine headaches are causally related to service. 

As such, service connection is granted.
