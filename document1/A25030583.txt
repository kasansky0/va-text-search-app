ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a mood disorder as secondary to the service-connected tinnitus is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's mood disorder is not secondary to the service-connected tinnitus, and is not otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a mood disorder due to service or the service-connected tinnitus are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service from November 1988 to July 1997.

In April 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2021 decision.  In July 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2021 decision.  In the January 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2021 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran contends that his mood disorder is secondary to his service-connected tinnitus.  August 2020 claim.  

Because the Veteran has not raised, and the record does not reasonably raise, entitlement to direct service connection, the Board's adjudication will consider only entitlement to secondary service connection.

Service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that is proximately due to or the result of, or is aggravated beyond its natural progress by the service-connected tinnitus.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a mood disorder, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's mood disorder is proximately due to or the result of, or aggravated by service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). 

The Veteran submitted a private February 2020 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) showing a diagnosis of mood disorder due to known physiological condition with depressive features.  The Veteran reported that tinnitus caused chronic sleep impairment, which worsened his moods.  The private psychologist opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran developed a chronic mood disorder due to his service-connected tinnitus.  However, no rationale for this opinion was provided.  Consequently, the Board accords this opinion minimal probative value.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  

The Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination to determine if his mood disorder was secondary to his service-connected tinnitus.  However, the examination was canceled at the Veteran's request.  In an October 2020 statement, the Veteran requested that all upcoming appointments be canceled, and to utilize the medical evidence submitted.  While VA has a duty to assist the Veteran in substantiating his claim, that duty is not a one-way street.  Woods v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 214, 224 (2000).  As such, no examination has been provided to the Veteran. 

The Board has considered the Veteran's claim based upon all the evidence of record, including the medical evidence submitted by the Veteran.  As noted above, the private medical opinion does not provide any rationale, and a grant of service connection based on such opinion is not warranted because such a minimally probative opinion does not serve to place the positive and negative evidence in equipoise.  Since the Veteran requested to cancel his VA examination, no additional medical evidence was obtained.  Based on the evidence of record, service connection for a mood disorder as secondary to the service-connected tinnitus is not warranted.  

The Veteran believes the claimed mood disorder is proximately due to or the result of/aggravated by his service-connected tinnitus disability.  While he is competent to observe lay symptoms, he does not have the training or credentials to provide a competent opinion as to a nexus.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011). 

Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the evidence failing to show a relationship to his service-connected tinnitus in denying this claim.
