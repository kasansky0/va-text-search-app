ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of June 22, 2021, for a 70 percent disability rating for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of June 22, 2021, for a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of June 22, 2021, for eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the period from June 22, 2021, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms for his PTSD more closely approximate occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

2. For the period from June 22, 2021, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities caused him to be unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment.

3. As entitlement to a TDIU is granted herein as of June 22, 2021, basic eligibility for DEA benefits have been met as of that date.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. For the period from June 22, 2021, the criteria for a disability rating of 70 percent for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU on and after June 22, 2021, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

3. The criteria for the award of basic eligibility for DEA benefits on and after June 22, 2021, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1963 to January 1967.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in April 2024 and December 2024 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 and December 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date of June 22, 2021, for a 70 percent disability rating for PTSD.

The Veteran's PTSD is currently rated at 50 percent for the period from June 22, 2021, and 70 percent for the period from December 14, 2021. The Veteran contends that his service-connected PTSD should be rated at 70 percent disabling for the entire period of appeal. For the reasons that follow, the Board agrees and grants the appeal.

As an initial matter, the Board finds that the Veteran has continuously pursued this matter since his June 22, 2021, claim. Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an original claim will be, for claims not received within one year from separation, the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. An earlier effective date for a claim filed more than a year after separation may nonetheless be preserved if the claim has been continuously pursued. For a claim to be continuously pursued, a supplemental claim must be filed within one year after a final decision or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h). If such a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date on which the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h).

The Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim for service connection for PTSD on June 22, 2021, which was granted in an October 2021 rating decision. The Board finds that the Veteran has continually pursued the appeal of the rating for his PTSD.

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The issue in this appeal is whether the Veteran's associated symptoms caused the level of impairment required for a disability rating of greater than 50 percent for the period of appeal prior to December 14, 2021.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's symptoms most closely approximated the symptoms associated with a 70 percent rating and resulted in a level of impairment that most closely approximated the level of impairment associated with a 70 percent rating.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2021. At the October 2021 VA examination, the examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms caused occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, which correspond to a 50 percent disability rating. 

In December 2021, the Veteran attended another VA examination, and the examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms caused occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. 

Although the October 2021 and December 2021 VA examinations found that the Veteran's symptoms caused occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, which corresponds to a 50 percent disability rating, in a June 2022 rating decision, the AOJ found that the Veteran's symptoms most closely approximated the criteria required for a 70 percent disability rating. The Board is generally bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

Given the relatively short period of time between the October 2021 VA examination and December 2021 VA examination, along with the Veteran's representative's arguments that the Veteran's symptoms were similar from the time of filing to the present, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms caused occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas for the period of appeal from June 22, 2021. Therefore, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a 70 percent disability rating for his PTSD for the period from June 22, 2021, is granted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of June 22, 2021, for a TDIU is granted.

3. Entitlement to an effective date of June 22, 2021, for eligibility for DEA benefits is granted.

The Veteran is in receipt of a TDIU and DEA benefits, effective July 17, 2023. 

In a December 2024 rating decision, the AOJ found that the Veteran's PTSD caused him to be unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, and assigned an effective date of July 17, 2023, the day that he filed a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim For Compensation and/or Benefits.

As discussed above, the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim for an increased rating since his June 22, 2021, claim. As TDIU is considered part of an increased rating claim, the Board also finds that the Veteran's TDIU claim has been continuously pursued since June 22, 2021. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h).

The evidence of record establishes that the Veteran has not worked during the entire period of appeal. See December 2004 Social Security Administration Disability Determination and Transmittal.

A TDIU is warranted when the evidence shows that the veteran is precluded from obtaining or maintaining any gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience by reason of his service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. For the period from June 22, 2021, after the AOJ effectuates the above grant of an earlier effective date, the Veteran will be in receipt of a 70 percent disability rating for PTSD from June 22, 2021. Thus, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for assignment of a TDIU as of June 22, 2021. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 4.16(a).

The Board turns to the second aspect of TDIU: whether the veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. The term "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 has two components.

First, there is an economic component which essentially contemplates an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Second, there is a non-economic component dealing with the individual veteran's ability to follow and secure employment. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019). The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims defined "employment in a protected environment" within 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) to unambiguously mean "a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024)

Here, the Veteran formerly worked as a welder. The AOJ has previously found that the Veteran's PTSD alone supports a grant of TDIU. See December 2024 rating decision. 

The Board finds that, although there are some differences in the medical evidence, including VA examinations conducted during the period of appeal prior to July 17, 2023, the evidence establishes that the severity of the Veteran's symptoms has been relatively consistent during the period of appeal. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD caused him to be unable to unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation for the period from June 22, 2021, and the Veteran is entitled to a TDIU for that period.

Additionally, for purposes of entitlement to DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, basic eligibility exists if, among other things, a veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and is rated permanently and totally disabled due to service-connected disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021.

As the Board is granting an earlier effective date for the Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU from June 22, 2021, the Veteran's basic eligibility for DEA is also established as of June 22, 2021.
