REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for right hip degenerative arthritis with iliopsoas tendonitis, limitation of extension, prior to January 13, 2022, is remanded.

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for right hip degenerative arthritis with iliopsoas tendonitis, thigh impairment, prior to January 13, 2022, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps from May 1972 to May 1973. 

These issues come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from April 2024 and September 2023 Rating Decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the May 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal for the issue of entitlement to an increased initial disability rating in excess of 0 percent for right hip degenerative arthritis with iliopsoas tendonitis, limitation of extension. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

For the claim of entitlement to an increased initial disability rating in excess of 0 percent for right hip degenerative arthritis with iliopsoas tendonitis, thigh impairment, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to initial compensable disability ratings prior to January 13, 2022, for right hip degenerative arthritis with iliopsoas tendonitis, limitation of extension, and for right hip degenerative arthritis with iliopsoas tendonitis, thigh impairment.

The Veteran contends he is entitled an earlier effective date than January 13, 2022, for his 10 percent disability rating of right hip degenerative arthritis with iliopsoas tendonitis, limitation of extension, and for his 20 percent disability rating of right hip degenerative arthritis with iliopsoas tendonitis, thigh impairment, hereafter both "right hip degenerative arthritis". See May 2024 Notice of Disagreement. The Board has recharacterized the issues because the Veteran disputes that there are distinct periods where his service-connected disabilities exhibit symptoms warranting different ratings, i.e., stage ratings. A dispute over staged ratings is not an effective issue, but rather a disagreement over the degree of disability. See generally Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

By way of background, the Veteran filed for service connection for his right hip degenerative arthritis in April 2021. See April 2021 Fully Developed Claim. The Veteran's claim was granted in an April 2021 Rating Decision. The Veteran was awarded service connection for his right hip degenerative arthritis, with an initial disability rating of 0 percent both limitation of extension and thigh impairment. See April 2021 Rating Decision. However, the Veteran disagreed with the initial disability rating and filed a January 2022 Supplemental Claim, arguing the inadequacy of the VA exam with respect to the severity of his conditions. See January 2022 Supplemental Claim. A lengthy procedural process ensued. 

In summary, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination in September 2022. No range of motion testing was performed. The VA examiner documented that this was because the Veteran refused due to perceived pain that would occur. Additionally, the VA examiner remarked that the Veteran's inability to exhibit range of motion testing was inconsistent with observations made of the Veteran at the office. The Veteran argued the VA examiner did not attempt range of motion testing and only asked him questions concerning his conditions. Nonetheless, the examiner did not opine on the condition of the Veteran's right hip degenerative arthritis conditions prior to his exam nor when the symptomatology began. See September 2022 C&P Exam. The AOJ thereafter continued the 0 percent disability rating for the Veterans right hip degenerative arthritis. See September 2022 Rating Decision. 

The Veteran filed another Supplemental Claim and was afforded another VA examination in December 2022. Based on the results of this examination, the AOJ awarded the Veteran a 10 percent disability rating for his limitation of extension and 20 percent for his thigh impairment for his right hip degenerative arthritis. Although the examiner documented the Veteran's reports that the condition first started in 1972, the examiner did not comment on the prior period. The effective date for both ratings was January 13, 2022, the date of his first Supplemental Claim. See December 2022 Rating Decision. The Veteran has sought review of the rating prior to January 13, 2022, persistently. See, e.g., April 2023 Supplemental Claim; May 2023 Request for Higher-Level Review; September 2023 Supplemental Claim. 

The AOJ assigned an effective date of January 2022. See December 2022 Rating Decision. However, after multiple filings by the Veteran claiming an earlier effective date, the AOJ proposed a reduction in its September 2023 Rating Decision, determining that there was no evidence of record that showed an increased disability of the Veteran's right hip degenerative arthritis until his VA exam in December 2022. See September 2023 Rating Decision. Regardless, the Veteran still contends he is awarded to an earlier effective date than either the December 2022 or January 2022 dates. Furthermore, he argues that the December 2022 VA examination showing a higher severity of his conditions is self-evident proof of the severity of his disability during the prior period. See May 2023 Request for Higher Level Review; March 2024 Third Party Correspondence. 

The AOJ has repeated in its Rating Decisions that the April 2021 VA examination is adequate and is based on completed range of motion testing, that the September 2022 VA examination is adequate despite the inability of the examiner to obtain range of motion testing due to the Veteran's perceived pain, and that the only factual evidence warranting an effective date for the Veteran's conditions occur in the December 2022 VA examination. See December 2022 Rating Decision; March 2023 Rating Decision; May 2023 Rating Decision; September 2023 Rating Decision; April 2024 Rating Decision. 

Despite this, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) recently issued a decision finding that VA is required to discount the beneficial effects of medication when the relevant rating criteria do not explicitly contemplate medication use. Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327*. This includes musculoskeletal disabilities as the applicable diagnostic codes and special regulations do not explicitly contemplate medication use. Id. As such, the Board must discount the beneficial effects of medication when assigning an evaluation of a musculoskeletal disability, which includes the Veteran's right hip degenerative arthritis. 

The Veteran was prescribed a daily dose of 50mg and gel of diclofenac as well as a lidocaine patch for his hip pain. See CAPRI Records (VA physician reviewing list of active medications at a February 2021 VA appointment). 

The Board sincerely regrets the additional delay, but remand is required for the Board to comply with the recent holding in Ingram. Not only was the Veteran afforded three VA examinations in association with his various claims for right hip degenerative arthritis which do not discount the beneficial effects of medication, the period pertinent to this appeal does not contain one. Thus, currently, there is no adequate VA exam that provides medical evidence for the period prior to December 2022 for adjudication purposes. Id.; 38 U.S.C. § 5103A. 

To cure this inadequacy, remand is required both to provide an adequate medical examination that complies with the recent holding from the CAVC and to provide a retrospective opinion on the Veteran's condition prior to December 2022. When there is an absence of medical evidence during a certain period of time, a retroactive medical evaluation may be warranted. Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80 (2008).

Thus, a remand is required for the AOJ to obtain a retrospective opinion related to the severity of the Veteran's right hip degenerative arthritis for the period prior to January 13, 2022. The Board by this remand makes no determination, expressed or implied, concerning the credibility of any statements on file.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a retrospective opinion and comment as to whether the Veteran's active motion, passive motion, and pain with weight-bearing and without weight-bearing and the severity, frequency, and duration of any flare-ups, and the degree of functional loss during flare-ups can be estimated for the period prior to January 13, 2022, for the Veteran's right hip degenerative arthritis. 

The examiner must establish what medications the Veteran is taking and establish a baseline severity level for each of the Veteran's right hip degenerative arthritis conditions that discounts their alleviating effects. 

The claims file should be made available for review, and the examination report should reflect that such review occurred.

The examiner is reminded that a medical opinion based solely on the absence of documentation in the record or that does not address the Veteran's reports of symptoms and history is inadequate. If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation.

A complete rationale for all opinions should be set forth and a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved would be of considerable assistance to the Board.
