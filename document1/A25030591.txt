REMANDED

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for cervical spine strain is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from January 1984 to January 2004. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the February 2024 higher level review rating decision. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to an increased rating for cervical spine strain.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for his service-connected cervical spine strain. See April 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement. 

The Board cannot make a fully informed decision on the issue of increased rating and finds that a remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist and conduct further development before the claim can be decided. 

The Veteran's cervical spine strain is currently assigned a 20 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 5237. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. 

The Board notes that a review of the record reveals the Veteran takes medication to alleviate the symptoms of his cervical spine strain during flare-ups. See July 2023 Neck (Cervical Spine) Conditions DBQ. As the applicable diagnostic codes and special musculoskeletal regulations do not reference medication, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects when assigning an evaluation. See Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025).  Here, the medical evidence of record is inadequate to the extent it is unclear whether the ameliorative effects of such medication, if any, were discounted in determining the severity of the Veteran's cervical spine strain. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012). As such, a remand is necessary to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the severity of the Veteran's cervical spine strain. An examination should only be scheduled if the clinician deems one is necessary to provide the requested opinions. 

(a)	The examiner should indicate whether any medications used by the Veteran are productive of ameliorative effects on the service-connected cervical spine strain. 

(b)	If so, the examiner must identify each medication and clearly explain what the Veteran's symptoms and ranges of motions would be without the medication in all relevant measurements, to include during flare-ups or with repeated use over time.

(c)	In so opining the examiner should consider the lay and medical evidence of record. 

A rationale for all opinions must be provided. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she must explain why an opinion cannot be provided (e.g., lack of sufficient information or evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.).
