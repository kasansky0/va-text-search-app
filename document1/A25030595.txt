DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 4, 2017, for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 9, 2019, for service connection for migraine tension headaches is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim for VA benefits that was received in February 2018, within one year of his separation from active service; his formal claim for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea was received in November 2018, within one year of his intent to file.

2. The evidence does not support a formal or informal claim for service connection for migraine tension headaches prior to September 9, 2019.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an earlier effective date of August 4, 2017, for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to September 9, 2019, for service connection for migraine tension headaches have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 2012 to April 2013 and from September 2016 to August 2017.

The Veteran's earlier effective date claims were denied in a November 2023 rating decision issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the November 2023 decision.  In May 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior November 2023 decision.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 28, 2018, for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an original claim will be the day following separation from active service or the date of entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

In cases where the claim is shown to have been preceded by an intent to file a claim within one year prior to the receipt date of the application therefor, the claim is considered to have been constructively filed as of the receipt date of the intent to file. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

Here, the Veteran was discharged from active service on August 3, 2017. He submitted an "intent to file" on February 28, 2018, followed by a VA 21-526 formal claim on November 19, 2018. His service connection award for sleep apnea is currently effective from the date of the "intent to file." He contends that an earlier effective date coinciding with the day following separation from service is warranted.

Here, the Veteran's February 2018 intent to file was received within one year of his separation from active service, and the November 2018 formal claim for service connection was received within one year of the February 2018 intent to file. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim is considered to have been received within a year of his separation from service. Thus, an earlier effective date of August 4, 2017, the day after the Veteran's separation from active service, is warranted for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 9, 2019, for service connection for migraine tension headaches

The Veteran also contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for service connection for migraine tension headaches. As an initial matter, the Veteran was awarded an increased rating for his headache condition, evaluated as 50 percent disabling, effective November 22, 2023. However, on the higher-level review and NOD filed in this appeal, he has not expressed disagreement with the 50 percent rating assigned or the effective date of said rating. Instead, the Veteran's claim has been consistently framed as "Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for tension headaches" or "effective date of migraine tension headaches". See January 2024 Request for HLR; June 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. Additionally, as discussed below, the arguments offered in this appeal relate only to the claim for an earlier effective date for service connection. Moreover, generally, earlier effective date issues are distinct issues separately appealable to the Board apart from increased rating issues. See, e.g., Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997). Accordingly, the Board finds that the issue on appeal is limited to whether an effective date prior to September 9, 2019, is warranted for service connection for tension headaches.  

The Veteran, through counsel, argues that the effective date for service connection of his headache condition should coincide with the day after his separation from active service. See June 2024 NOD. He also seems to argue that the effective date for service connection for headaches should be September 9, 2019. See HLR - Informal Conference, dated May 17, 2024.

By way of history, the Veteran filed a formal claim for service connection for headaches on September 9, 2019. In a November 2019 rating decision, he was granted service connection for tension headaches, evaluated as noncompensable, effective September 9, 2019. The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review in October 2020. A February 2021 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date.

The Veteran then filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application in July 2023. In November 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision which granted an increased 50 percent rating for the Veteran's tension headaches, effective November 22, 2023. The same decision denied an earlier effective date for service connection for migraine tension headaches.

The Veteran then filed another request for HLR in January 2024. The Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for service connection for tension headaches was then denied in a May 2024 rating decision. The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement in June 2024, expressing his disagreement with the effective date assigned for service connection for tension headaches.

In this case, continuous pursuit of the Veteran's claim has been conceded since the filing of the initial claim for service connection for headaches, received on September 9, 2019. See May 2024 Rating Decision. Accordingly, the Veteran's argument for an effective date of September 9, 2019, as advanced in the May 2024 HLR Informal Conference is moot, as this is the effective date already assigned for service connection for tension headaches.

As to the Veteran's argument for an effective date coinciding with day after his separation from active service, there is simply no evidence to support his claim. In contrast to the Veteran's sleep apnea effective date claim discussed above, the Veteran did not file an Intent to File within one year of discharge from active service. Instead, the earliest communication expressing the Veteran's desire to seek compensation for his headache condition is the formal claim received on September 9, 2019. As the Veteran was discharged from service in August 2017, his formal claim was not received within one year of discharge from service.

As there is no evidence of a claim for service connection for headaches within one year of discharge, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). Accordingly, even if the Veteran experienced headaches prior to September 9, 2019, the date of claim is still the later of the two dates, and therefore, the correct effective date. Based on the foregoing, the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date must be denied.
