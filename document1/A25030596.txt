REMANDED

Entitlement to waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits in the amount of $11,220.00 to include the question of whether the overpayment was properly created, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from August 1977 to August 1991.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In October 2023 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). However, the Veteran identified multiple review options. In October 2023 the Veteran was asked to clarify his review option. 

Thereafter, in a December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to waiver of recovery of an overpayment VA benefits in the amount of $11,220.00 to include the question of whether the overpayment was properly created.

By way of history, in October 2023 the AOJ removed the Veteran's spouse, S., from the Veteran's award, effective April 1, 2016, the first of the month following their divorce in March 2016. The AOJ noted that the adjustment will result in an overpayment and the Veteran would receive a separate letter from VA's Debt Management Center (DMC) the provides the exact amount of overpayment and notice of the rights to request a repayment plan and/or waiver of the debt. The DMC notified the Veteran of the amount of the overpayment and of his rights in October 2023. Thereafter, the Veteran submitted his VA Form 10182s.

The Veteran is challenging the whether the overpayment was properly created and seeking a waiver of the recovery of the overpayment. Specifically, he stated that he should not have to repay at least part of this debt as he was remarried during part of the period of the overpayment.  

Notably, a review of the record reflects that this overpayment request has not been adjudicated in the first instance by the Committee on Waivers or Compromises, as is required. See VAOPGCPREC 6-98 (July 24, 1998) (holding that when a veteran challenges the validity of the debt and seeks waiver of the debt, the [Regional Office] must first fully review the debt's validity and, if the office believes the debt to be valid, prepare a written decision fully justifying the validity of the debt before referring the waiver request to the Committee on Waivers and Compromises). Remand is warranted to correct this error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Refer the request for a waiver of recovery of the overpayment to the Committee on Waivers and Compromises for adjudication.
