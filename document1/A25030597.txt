ORDER

A 30 percent rating, but no higher, for service-connected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is granted, subject to the law and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

Entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with trochanteric bursitis is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for right hip right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with limitation of extension is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for right hip right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with impairment is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's GERD symptoms more nearly approximated pyrosis and reflux, accompanied by substernal pain, productive of considerable impairment of health, but did not more nearly approximate pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

2. The Veteran's right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with trochanteric bursitis has been manifested by painful limitation of flexion to 90 degrees, including estimated range after repeated use over time, but has not more nearly approximated flexion limited to 30 degrees.

3. The Veteran's right hip right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with limitation of extension has been manifested by limitation of extension to at most 20 degrees including estimated range after repeated use over time. 

4. The Veteran's right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with impairment has been manifested by painful abduction, adduction external rotation and internal rotation; the evidence does not show that the Veteran cannot toe out more than 15 degrees, cannot cross legs, or that there is motion lost beyond 10 degrees. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an increased disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for GERD are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.20, 4.27, 4.114, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7346.

2. The criteria for an initial disability rating greater than 10 percent for right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with trochanteric bursitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5252.

3. The criteria for a compensable rating for right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with limitation of extension are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a,  DC 5251.

4. The criteria for a compensable rating for right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with impairment have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5253.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the New York Army National Guard, the Florida Army National Guard, and the Pennsylvania Army National Guard.  His service included periods of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) from February1997 to August 1997 and from March 2007 to June 2007 and periods of active duty from August 2004 to November 2005, from February 2009 to February 2010, and from August 2012 to October 2013.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision, which continued the ratings for GERD rated as 10 percent disabling; right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with bursitis rated as 10 percent disabling; and right hip impairment and limitation of extension, both separately rated as noncompensable.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) indicating disagreement with the evaluation assigned for GERD and right hip and requested review of a June 2023 decision.  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2023 decision.  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. He specifically indicated disagreement with the ratings assigned for GERD and right hip. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertion that June 2023 decision denied benefits due to CUE. However, the AOJ has not yet considered the Veteran's assertion of CUE, and the Board cannot consider an assertion of AOJ CUE in the first instance. See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 334 (2006) (en banc) (assertion of CUE in an RO decision must first be presented to and decided by  the RO before the Board has jurisdiction to decide the matter).  Moreover, allegations of CUE must be pled with specificity. Thus, the Board cannot address the Veteran's CUE assertion in this decision. The Veteran may wish to work with his representative to assist him in filing a CUE claim.

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the whole recorded history to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition. The medical as well as industrial history is to be considered, and a full description of the effects of the disability upon ordinary activity is also required. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

GERD

The Veteran's GERD is currently evaluated as 10 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7399-7346.

When an unlisted condition is encountered it will be permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous. 38 C.F.R. § 4.20. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.27, unlisted disabilities requiring rating by analogy will be coded with the numbers of the most closely related body part followed by '99' and then hyphenated to include the diagnostic code being used.

During the pendency of the appeal, VA published amendments to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, the Schedule of Ratings for the Digestive System, effective May 19, 2024. Prior to this date, GERD was rated analogous to hiatal hernia under Diagnostic 7346. Under the amended criteria, a new diagnostic code (Diagnostic Code 7206) was added for GERD.

Prior to May 19, 2024, pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7346, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity. A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. The maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

The Rating Schedule does not define "considerable" or "severe" impairment of health." However, for reference, "considerable" is defined as "large in extent or degree." Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/considerable (last visited February 18, 2025). "Severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful." Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/severe (last visited February 18, 2025).

Under the new Diagnostic Code 7206 for GERD, a noncompensable evaluation is assigned for documented history without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications. A 10 percent rating is assigned for documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic. A 30 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement: 50 documented histories of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year. A maximum 80 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube).

When the rating criteria are amended during the pendency of an appeal, if an old criterion is more favorable, it will be considered for the period after the change was made. See Ervin v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 34 Vet. App. 318, 322 (2011). In Ervin, the Court explained that when a regulation changes while a claim is pending, the version most favorable to the Veteran applies unless doing so would have an impermissible retroactive effect. Id.

The amendment of the rating criteria is not itself evidence and therefore consideration of the amendments is not precluded due to the evidence window. Cf. Green v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 127, 136 (2024) ("the Board's service connection decision was not evidence"). However, because the amendments do not apply retroactively, the period of time during which they could apply is after the record closed on the date of the June 2023 rating decision and after the evidence window closed, the new criteria do not appear to be for application. 

During a March 2023 VA esophageal conditions examination, the Veteran reported current symptoms of substernal pain and difficulty with sleep. He stated that he treats his GERD with Pepcid and TUMS, but they do not really help. He also stated it does not matter what foods or drink he consumes. The examiner noted that that the Veteran had pyrosis; reflux; substernal pain; sleep disturbance that occurs four or more times per year that lasts less than one day. There were neither lay reports or physician findings of material weight loss; hematemesis; melena with moderate anemia; nor an esophageal stricture, spasm of esophagus (cardiospasm or achalasia), or an acquired diverticulum of the esophagus. The examiner opined that GERD does not functionally impact the Veteran's ability to work.

Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's GERD symptoms have more nearly approximated the criteria for a 30 percent increased disability rating. The evidence of record shows that the Veteran experienced pyrosis (heartburn), reflux, and sleep disturbance, accompanied by substernal pain, productive of a considerable impairment of health. 

The Board notes that the Veteran's GERD is treated with over-the-counter medication, which the Veteran reported is not effective. Regardless, "the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria." Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). DC 7346 does not contemplate the effects of relief provided by medication. The Veteran has taken medication to treat his GERD with a minimum degree of effectiveness. Given that the Veteran stated that the medications "do not really help," there is no basis in this case for discounting the ameliorative effects of the medication and there are no such ameliorative effects.  Cf. Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025) (the Board is required "to discount beneficial medication effects when relevant rating criteria do not specifically contemplate medication use").

The evidence does not reflect that the Veteran's GERD symptoms included vomiting, material weight loss, hematemesis, or melena with moderate anemia.  Moreover, the above evidence reflects that symptoms that the Veteran were not very painful or harmful and did not cause impairment above the level of considerable impairment of health.  Thus, the record does not indicate that the symptoms of the Veteran's GERD more nearly approximate the criteria for a 60 percent disability rating under DC 7346 and a higher rating of 60 percent is therefore not warranted.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether a rating higher than 30 percent for GERD is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against such a rating.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim. Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

Right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with bursitis, right hip limitation of extension, right hip impairment

The Veteran's right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with bursitis is currently rated separately as noncompensable under DC 5019-5251, 10 percent under DC 5019-5252, and noncompensable under DC 5019-5253. 

Under Diagnostic Code 5251, a maximum 10 percent rating is warranted for extension of the thigh limited to 5 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5251.

Under Diagnostic Code 5252, a 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 20 degrees. A maximum 40 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 10 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5252.

Under Diagnostic Code 5253, a 10 percent rating is warranted for limitation of rotation of affected leg, cannot toe out more than 15 degrees. A 10 percent rating is also warranted for limitation of adduction, cannot cross legs. A maximum 20 percent rating is warranted for limitation of abduction, motion lost beyond 10 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5253. 

In addition to considering range of motion findings, Board must also evaluate evidence of a Veteran's inability to perform "normal working movements" with "strength, speed, coordination, or endurance."  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 38 (2011) (citing 38 C.F.R. § 4.40); see also DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 205-06 (1995).  For rating purposes, all "possible manifestations" of functional loss must be evaluated, and one such manifestation cannot be evaluated to the exclusion of others.  See Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 36-37; 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 ("Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part which becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled").  In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court found an orthopedic examination inadequate where the examiner declined to provide an estimate of the degree of additional loss of motion due to flare-ups because such would require resort to speculation. Id. at 29, 36.  However, as shown below, the Veteran did not experience flare-ups with regard to his hips, and Sharp is therefore not for application in this regard.

Turning to the evidence, during a March 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he has right hip pain that limits his activities and can affect his sleep. He stated that he is unable to sit or stand for prolonged periods of time and he uses Aleve roll-on gel and other over-the-counter medications for relief. He did not report flareups. 

Initial range of motion testing revealed flexion limited to 90 degrees and extension limited to 20 degrees, both with painful motion. Abduction was limited to 25 degrees; adduction was limited to 20 degrees; external rotation was limited to 50 degrees; and internal rotation limited to 30 degrees, all with painful motion. Passive range of motion testing revealed the same results as the active motion, with pain exhibited on all passive ranges of motion. Limitation in passive adduction did not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs. 

There was evidence of pain on nonweight-bearing, and active and passive motion that did not result in/cause functional loss. These findings complied with Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), in which the Court held that 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 creates range of motion testing requirements with which VA must comply, specifically, "The joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint."  There was no evidence of crepitus, but there was objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue which the examiner described as mild due to bursitis. There was no evidence of ankylosis of the hip, flail joint hip, or impairment of femur. The examiner determined that the Veteran's right hip did not impact his ability to work.

The above evidence is persuasively against awarding a compensable rating for right hip limitation of extension under DC 5251. At worst, limitation of extension was limited to 15 degrees, even when considering repeated use over time. For a higher rating to be awarded for limitation of extension, right hip extension would have to be limited to or more nearly approximate extension to 5 degrees and the above evidence shows that it does not. 

Though the Veteran has exhibited pain on extension, he is already compensated for the painful movement of his right hip with a 10 percent rating under DC 5252 which pertains to limited flexion of the thigh (discussed below).  See Frazier v. McDonough, 66 F.4th 1353, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is intended to be read in conjunction with, and not separately from, the applicable diagnostic codes).  See also Swanbeck v. McDonough, No. 22-0350, 2022 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1895 (Nov. 22, 2022) (mem dec) (Allen, J.) ("We agree with the Secretary that only one 10 percent rating is warranted for each of appellant's knees and that the Board did not err in finding that to be the case. Section 4.59 allows for a 10 percent disability rating when there is no compensable limitation of motion in the hip joint. To award multiple 10 percent ratings for painful motion of the same hip joint would be pyramiding, which is impermissible.... This is precisely what appellant seeks in this matter. He has been awarded a 10 percent rating for painful motion of the right hip but seeks an additional rating for his right hip based on the same manifestation"); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).  Assigning another 10 percent rating for limitation of extension due painful motion  would also constitute pyramiding; therefore, the Board cannot assign a compensable rating of the Veteran's right hip extension based on painful motion. Consequently, a compensable disability rating for right hip limitation of extension under DC 5251 is not warranted.

The above evidence is also persuasively against awarding a rating higher than 10 percent for right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with bursitis rated as limitation of flexion under DC 5252. Limitation of flexion was limited to 90 degrees with painful motion, even when considering repeated use over time. For a higher 20 rating to be awarded for limitation of flexion, right hip flexion would have to be limited to or more nearly approximate flexion limited to 30 degrees and the above evidence shows that it does not. Consequently, a disability rating greater than 10 percent for a right hip trochanteric pain syndrome with bursitis under DC 5252 is not warranted.  The Board has considered that the Veteran indicated he was unable to sit or stand for prolonged periods of time.  Although interference with sitting and standing are related considerations under 38 C.F.R. § 4.45(f), there was no indication that this interference resulted in symptoms more nearly approximating flexion limited to 30 degrees, particularly in the absence of flare-ups.

The above evidence is also persuasively against awarding a compensable rating for right hip impairment under DC 5253. The Veteran's right hip did not prevent crossing his right leg; abduction was limited to 25 degrees; and adduction was limited to 20 degrees. For a higher rating to be awarded, rotation of the right leg cannot toe out more than 15 degrees or the right leg would have to be prevented from crossing or motion must be lost beyond 10 degrees. The evidence does not indicate such. Consequently, a compensable disability rating for right hip impairment under DC 5253 is not warranted.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether an initial compensable rating for right hip strain with limitation of extension is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against an initial compensable rating.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Conclusion

The Board has considered the Veteran's claims for higher ratings and decided entitlement based on the evidence. Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with respect to these claims. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
