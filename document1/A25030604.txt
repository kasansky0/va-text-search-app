REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from November 1988 to April 1989 and from January to April 1992.

These matters are on appeal from an April 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be the day following separation from service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation, otherwise the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  

Furthermore, 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) provides, in part, as follows: (3) An award made based all or in part on the records identified by [38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(1)] is effective on the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later, or such other date as may be authorized by the provisions of this part applicable to the previously decided claim. (4) A retroactive evaluation of disability resulting from disease or injury subsequently service connected on the basis of the new evidence from the service department must be supported adequately by medical evidence.  Where such records clearly support the assignment of a specific rating over a part or the entire period of time involved, a retroactive evaluation will be assigned accordingly, except as it may be affected by the filing date of the original claim.

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  

As to claims filed before March 24, 2015, the term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). 

Before March 24, 2015, the term "claim" or "application" meant a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  Any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, from a clamant or her representative, may be considered an informal claim.  Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  

In this regard, it is well settled that intent to apply for benefits is an essential element of any claim, whether formal or informal, and, further, the intent must be communicated in writing.  See MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the plain language of the regulations requires a claimant to have an intent to file a claim for VA benefits); Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (noting that even an informal claim for benefits must be in writing).  

Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If received within one year from the date it was sent to the clamant, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

As to claims filed after March 24, 2015, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The term "claim" means a formal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  

As to claims filed after March 24, 2015, the Veterans' Administration (VA) administrative claims process only recognizes formal claims.  A formal claim was one that had been filed on the form prescribed by VA.  Id.

However, for an increase in disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2). Meaning if the increase occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." For earlier effective date increased rating claims, if the increase occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2) (2017); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (Sept. 23, 1998).

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an effective date prior to November 21, 2020 for the grant of service connection for the disabilities listed above.

The Veteran was denied service connection for his back disability in February 2011.  The Veteran did not perfect an appeal within one year of the rating decision and the rating decision became final.  

In September 2014, the Veteran was denied service connection for his back again and was also denied service connection for his left ankle and right knee disabilities. Again, the Veteran did not perfect an appeal within one year of the rating decision and the rating decision became final.  

The Veteran filed a new claim in October 2015 and was denied service connection for his back, left ankle, and right knee again in a February 2016 rating decision.   Again, the Veteran did not perfect an appeal within one year of the rating decision and the rating decision became final.  

The Veteran submitted an intent to file form in November 2017.  Though other evidence was added ot the file, including lay statements and private examinations, no claim was filed within a year of this intent to file. Therefore, this date cannot be the basis for a finding of an earlier effective date based on a previously unadjudicated filed claim.

The Veteran's next claim was filed in November 2020.  In response to that claim, after denying the claims for service connection for the Veteran's back, right knee, and left ankle in an April 2021 rating decision, service connection for those disabilities as well as his other claimed disabilities was granted in the April 2023 rating decision on appeal.

As discussed above, there were no unadjudicated claims that were pending prior to the claim the Veteran filed in November 2020.  

The Board notes the Veteran's November 2017 intent to file and the subsequently added lay statements and medical evidence. However, as discussed above, after March 24, 2015, claims must be filed on one of the formal claims' forms prescribed by VA.  No such claim was filed until November 2020.  

The Board understand the Veteran has been pursuing many of these claims for a long time, prior to November 2020, in particular, his claim to service connection for his back, right knee, and left ankle. However, those previous denials became final as the Veteran did not perfect an appeal and therefore, those previously filed claims dates cannot be used as a basis for a finding of an earlier effective date.  

Context in this case is important:  There is significant evidence in this case against the Veteran's claims.  For example, in July 1991, the Veteran himself (in his report of medical history for the ROTC position) denied the existence of these problems.  Overall, there is significant evidence of record that does not support the granting of these claims.  The granting of these claims was clearly based on evidence that did not exist when the Veteran filed these claims initially.  

Additionally, while entitlement to the Veteran's disabilities may have arisen prior to his current effective date, the earliest possible effective date is the date of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  In this case, the Board does not find any basis upon which to grant an earlier effective date.  If the Veteran is alleging there was clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the previous denials, that is a different type of claim and will not be addressed in this decision as the Veteran has not asserted such. If he would like to file such a claim, he is free to do so.

Because the Veteran's entitlement to DEA benefits arose from his award of totally disabling service connected disabilities, the Board finds DEA benefits also do not warrant a higher rating decision as prior to November 21, 2020, the Veteran's combined disability rating was not total and he did not meet any of the other criteria that would entitle him to DEA benefits, such as his permanent and total disabilities existing at the time of death, he died as a result of service connected disabilities, or that he died in service or was MIA, or capture in the line of duty.
