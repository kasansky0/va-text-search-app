ORDER

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran served on active duty from July 2018 to July 2023. 

2. Bilateral hearing loss has not been shown.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Bilateral hearing ear hearing loss was not incurred in service and is not presumed to have been incurred in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2025).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This decision has been written under the guidelines of the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claim. In March 2024, the Veteran appealed to the Board via a VA Form 10182 and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Turning to the relevant laws and regulations, service connection may be granted on a direct basis as a result of disease or injury incurred in service based on nexus using a three-element test: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a), (d); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 under the following circumstances: (1) where a chronic disease or injury is shown in service and subsequent manifestations of the same disease or injury are shown at a later date unless clearly attributable to an intercurrent cause; or (2) where there is continuity of symptomatology since service; or (3) by showing that the disorder manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307.

Hearing loss is recognized by VA as a "chronic disease" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); therefore, the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, and 3.309 apply. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015). 

Hearing loss is considered a disability for VA purposes when the threshold level in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; when the thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores, using the Maryland CNC test, are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran contends that he should be service connection for bilateral hearing loss. The Board notes that the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran's military occupation specialty of aviation ordnanceman had a high probability of noise exposure. Therefore, noise exposure is conceded; however, this is not the end of the inquiry; the first element of a current disability must be shown.

Turning to the medical evidence, the April 2023 VA examiner diagnosed left ear hearing sensorineural hearing loss; however, only in the frequency range of 6000 Hz or higher frequencies, beyond the frequencies considered by VA for purposes of determining service connection and ratings. They also reported normal right ear hearing. Significantly, hearing loss disability for VA purposes is not shown.

The April 2023 pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were reported as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	10	10	5	15	15

LEFT	5	5	15	20	25

The average pure tone threshold was 11 in the right ear and 16 in the left ear. Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 98 percent in the right ear and 100 percent in the left ear. 

Here, no evidence indicates that the Veteran had hearing loss of 40 decibels or greater for any frequency from 500 to 4000 Hertz nor that the Veteran's had hearing loss of 26 decibels or greater for at least three of the frequencies in the 500 to 4000 Hertz range. 

In addition, the speech recognition scores of 98 percent in the right ear and 100 percent in the left ear are better than the score of 94 percent necessary to show hearing loss pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Accordingly, the medical evidence does not support a finding of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes, during the appeal period.

Thus, the April 2023 VA examiner's reference to hearing loss in the left ear based on 6000 Hertz, the finding of preexisting hearing loss in the left ear without a permanent shift, and the finding that right ear hearing loss was less likely than not incurred in service are all given little to no probative weight because, as noted above, hearing loss for VA compensation purposes has not been shown.

In order to warrant service connection there must be evidence of a current diagnosis. Here, the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss for VA compensation purposes. 

 "Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability. In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim." Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Therefore, the appeal is denied.

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, for the Board's consideration. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
