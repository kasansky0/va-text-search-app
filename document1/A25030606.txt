FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed her intent to file (ITF) followed by claim for ovarian cysts on November 30, 2020, and continuously pursued the claim since that date, until the rating was increased in a January 2023 rating decision.  

2. The date of claim is November 30, 2020; however, there was no evidence of a factually ascertainable increase in the severity of the Veteran's ovarian cysts until March 8, 2022.  

3. The issues of secondary service connection for anterior abdominal scars, and painful anterior abdominal scars was reasonably raised during the processing of the November 30, 2020 claim, filed for service connection for the primary disability of ovarian cysts. 

4. The date of claim is November 30, 2020; however, there was no evidence of entitlement to SMC until June 17, 2022.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of March 8, 2022, but not earlier, for the grant of a 30 percent rating for ovarian cysts have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.159, 3.400, 3.816, 3.2500, 4.116, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7615.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of November 30, 2020, but not earlier, for the grant of service connection for a painful, anterior abdominal scar have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.106, 3.155, 3.158, 3.400, 3.655.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of November 30, 2020, but not earlier, for the grant of service connection for an anterior abdominal scar have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.106, 3.155, 3.158, 3.400, 3.655.

4. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to April 8, 2022, for the grant of special monthly compensation (SMC) have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.106, 3.155, 3.158, 3.400, 3.655.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from March 1995 until January 1999, and from December 2001 until December 2002. 

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and requested review of a January 2023 rating decision.  In June 2023, the RO issued the higher-level review decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 rating decision.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the RO issued the decision which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its Decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision.

The Board has reviewed all evidence of record regardless of whether it is discussed in detail in the Decision.  See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

I.

Legal Criteria - Effective Date 

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  In addition, the effective date for the grant of service connection is not based on the earliest evidence, medical or otherwise, demonstrating a causal connection.  It is based on the date of the claim.

A claim is a written or electronic communication, on an application form prescribed by VA, requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit.  Id. §3.1(p).  An initial claim is any complete claim, other than a supplemental claim.  Id. §3.1(p)(1).  An intent to file form need not identify the specific benefit claimed or any medical condition(s) on which the claim is based.  Id. §3.155(2).

After a veteran submits an intent to file form, they have one year to submit a complete claim, or VA will not take further action on the submission. Id. §3.155(4).  If a veteran does submit a complete claim within one year, the date of receipt of the intent to file form will be considered the date of claim.  Id. §3.155(d)(ii).

Under the procedural rules of the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA), a claimant who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  VA will readjudicate a claim if "new and relevant" evidenced is presented or secured.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d).  In the AMA system, an initial claim is a new claim requesting service connection for a disability or grant of a new benefit on a form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p)(1), 3.160(b).  A supplemental claim is any complete claim for a VA benefit on an application form prescribed by the Secretary where an initial or supplemental claim for the same or similar benefit on the same or similar basis was previously decided.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p)(2); 3.2501.

Additionally, under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, within one year from when the decision was issued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c).  If an AMA claim is continuously pursued in accordance with the guidelines, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h).

Following notice of a decision on an initial claim, the claimant may file a supplemental claim, request higher-level review, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c)(1).  In order to constitute continuous pursuit, such an action must be taken within a year of issuance of the decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h).

With regard to "the date entitlement arose" inquiry, for appeals stemming from an increased rating, such as the case here regarding the Veteran's claim for ovarian cysts, the effective date of an award may date back to the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the claim application is received within one year from such date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).  This one-year "look back" provision allows for a one-year grace period if the Veteran suffers a worsening of his disability, she can be awarded an increased rating effective the date of the worsening if she files her increased rating within that one-year grace period.  If she files her increased rating claim beyond one year, however, than the effective date can be no earlier than the date of receipt of claim.  Id.; Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511, 519 (1992).

Further, as noted above, the effective date for an increased rating depends on when the change in disability level can be "ascertained" and should not be "assigned mechanically" as the date of an examination.  See Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015).

II.

Analysis - Earlier Effective Date for Increased Rating for Ovarian Cysts

The Veteran asserts that she is entitled to an effective date prior to June 17, 2022 for the grant of a 30 percent rating for her service-connected ovarian cysts.  

The Veteran filed an ITF on November 30, 2020.  She followed it by a timely application for compensation on January 28, 2021 seeking service connection for, in relevant part, ovarian cysts.  In September 2021, a rating decision was issued granting service connection for ovarian cysts, rated as noncompensable, effective November 30, 2020, the date of receipt of her ITF.  

On April 8, 2022, she filed another ITF, and followed it by a supplemental claim on April 29, 2022, continuously pursuing a higher rating for her ovarian cysts.  

In January 2023, the RO issued a rating decision granting a 30 percent rating for her ovarian cysts, effective June 17, 2022, the date which the RO found that her disability had worsened based on her VA examination.  However, the Veteran asserts that her symptoms have been the same for the pendency of the appeal.  

The Veteran's ovarian cyst disorder has been rated under DC 7615 for the entire period on appeal.  Under Diagnostic Code 7615, ovary, disease, injury, or adhesions of, provides for rating under the General Formula for Disease, Injury, or Adhesions of Female Reproductive Organs (Diagnostic Codes 7610-7615), which provides a noncompensable rating for symptoms that do not require continuous treatment.  A 10 percent rating is provided for symptoms that require continuous treatment.  A 30 percent rating is provided for symptoms not controlled by continuous treatment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.116.  

As the appeal has been continuously pursued, the Board concludes that period on appeal begins on November 30, 2020, the date of receipt of the Veteran's initial ITF.  In March 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination and reported that she continued to have frequent cramping, pelvic pain, and an irregular menstrual cycle.  She stated that her condition had remained the same since onset in 1996, when she experienced a ruptured ovarian cyst without progressive worsening, and that her last rupture happened in 2004.  She stated that she was previously prescribed oral contraceptives to help her symptoms, but that her doctor told her to stop taking the medication when she turned thirty years of age.  The Veteran stated that she only treated her symptoms with over-the-counter pain medication.  

The Veteran reported symptoms of moderate, intermittent pain, pelvic pressure, irregular menstruation, and dysmenorrhea associated with ovarian dysfunction.  She denied any incontinence, fistulae, endometriosis, pelvic prolapse, or tumors.  No other pertinent symptoms or findings were reported. 

In September 2021 VA treatment notes, the Veteran underwent pelvic imaging after complaining of left lower quadrant pain.  An impression was rendered that her pain was likely menstruation related and possibly due to unseen, small cyst ruptures.  Her left ovary was unremarkable, and there was no free fluid in the sac.  Her right ovary was not visualized.  

On March 8, 2022, VA treatment notes showed that the Veteran was seen for having a history of irregular, heavy, and painful menstrual cycles, as well as a history of ruptured ovarian cysts.  The examiner noted that her cysts were managed in the past with contraceptives, but she was advised to stop four years prior for elevated lipids.  The examiner noted that she had now been on contraceptives for two months and was doing well.

In June 2022, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination and reported worsening of her disorder.  She reported experiencing pain in the left lower quadrant of her abdomen, and that she had vaginal dryness.  She stated that she took oral contraceptives and that this helped with the severity of the pain.  She reported symptoms of severe, intermittent pain, pelvic pressure, female vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse.  The examiner noted that she treated her condition with oral contraceptives and diagnosed her with female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD).  The Veteran denied any cyst rupture since 2004, incontinence, fistulae, endometriosis, pelvic organ prolapse, or tumors.  

The questions before the Board are as follows: First, when did the Veteran file her continuously pursued initial claim? Second, when did the entitlement for the 30 percent rating arise?  The effective date for the Veteran's 30 percent rating will be the later of these two dates.

To the first question, the date of claim has been established as November 30, 2020, as the Veteran has continuously pursued her claim since her initial filing.  As such, the remaining question before the Board is when there was a factually ascertainable increase in disability during the relevant appeal period prior to June 17, 2022, when a 30 percent, maximum rating was granted.  With her May 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran asserted that she has required continuous treatment for her ovarian cysts since 2009, and experienced painful cramping.  The Veteran asserted that the March 2021 VA examination was not accurate as it showed that she was not taking continuous medication to treat her symptoms, reporting instead that she had taken birth control continuously to treat her symptoms.  Thus, she asserted that the proper effective date was in fact November 30, 2020, for the assignment of a 30 percent rating.  

The medical evidence of record, however, shows that the Veteran did not begin taking oral contraceptives again to treat her ovarian cysts until approximately March 2022.  Specifically, March 8, 2022 VA treatment notes show the first notation that the Veteran had restarted oral contraceptives to treat her symptoms after having discontinued them for approximately four years.  Thus, the evidence does not support her statement that she continuously took oral contraceptives for the entire period on appeal.  Additionally, the March 2021 VA examination reflected her own reports that there had been no progression or worsening of her disorder, a statement that she used no medication continuously other than over-the-counter pain medications, and no additional symptoms.  These findings are also supported by subsequent VA treatment records which seemingly echo similar symptoms.  Thus, significant probative weight is assigned to these findings.  

However, as of approximately March 8, 2022, it appears that the record shows, for the first time, that the Veteran had restarted oral contraceptives a short while before.  Thus, it is factually ascertainable based on all the evidence of record, that an increase in the disability occurred as of that date.  Therefore, an effective date of March 8, 2022, but no earlier, is granted for the grant of a 30 percent rating for ovarian cysts.  The appeal is granted. 

III.

Analysis - Earlier Effective Date for Abdominal Scars

The Veteran asserts that she is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for her abdominal scars, as they are associated with her continuously pursued ovarian cyst claim.  

The Veteran filed an ITF on November 30, 2020.  She followed it by an application for compensation on January 28, 2021 seeking service connection for, in relevant part, ovarian cysts.  In September 2021, a rating decision was issued granting service connection for ovarian cysts, rated as noncompensable, effective November 30, 2020, the date of receipt of her ITF.  

On April 8, 2022, she filed another ITF, and followed it by a supplemental claim on April 29, 2022, continuously pursuing a higher rating for her ovarian cysts.  

In June 2022, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination which showed that she had abdominal scars associated with her ruptured ovarian cysts which had been present since 2004.  In January 2023, the RO issued a rating decision granting service connection for anterior abdominal scar and painful anterior abdominal scar, as related to her ovarian cysts.  

The RO assigned an effective date of April 8, 2022, aligning with the date of the Veteran's second ITF.  In the Veteran's original claim for service connection for her ovarian cyst, there was no explicit claim for abdominal scars.  

However, the claim of entitlement for an increased rating for her ovarian cysts, specifically including the rupturing of those cysts, includes the logically related complications of the disability that are reasonably raised by the record.  Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188 (2021); Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 103 (2022) (VA is obligated to identify, develop, and adjudicate claims for secondary service connection that are reasonably raised during the processing of a properly initiated claim as to the primary service-connected disability's evaluation level).

In the January 2023 rating decision, the claim for scars was inferred by the RO after they were identified at her June 2022 VA examination, as part and parcel of her claim for an increased rating for ovarian cysts.  Thus, the rating for the scars should maintain the same claims periods as the underlying disability.  Id. 

The Board acknowledges the March 2021 VA examination did not identify such scarring; however, the June 2022 VA examiner assigned a date of diagnosis for the scars dating back to 2004.  This finding is supported by the remaining evidence of record which showed the Veteran's last ovarian rupture occurred in 2004.  Thus, it logically follows that the scars have existed since that time.  The Veteran is also competent to report the date that she acquired her scars and has continuously stated that they occurred in connection with her last ovarian rupture in 2004.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994) (noting that a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).

Thus, an effective date of November 30, 2020, is warranted for the service connection of abdominal scars associated with ovarian cysts, aligning with the date of the receipt of the Veteran's ITF, followed by a completed claim for service connection for ovarian cysts, which has been continuously pursued since that time.  The appeals are granted.  

IV.

Analysis - Earlier Effective Date for SMC 

The Veteran asserts that she is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of SMC for loss of use of a creative organ, as it is associated with her continuously pursued ovarian cyst claim.  

The Veteran filed an ITF on November 30, 2020.  She followed it by an application for compensation on January 28, 2021, seeking service connection for, in relevant part, ovarian cysts.  In September 2021, a rating decision was issued granting service connection for ovarian cysts, rated as noncompensable, effective November 30, 2020, the date of receipt of her ITF.  On April 8, 2022, she filed another ITF, and followed it by a supplemental claim on April 29, 2022, continuously pursuing a higher rating for her ovarian cysts.  In June 2022, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination wherein the examiner diagnosed her FSAD for the first time in the record.   

VA provides SMC if a veteran, as a result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of one or more creative organs.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k).  In January 2023, the RO issued a rating decision granting service connection for FSAD, and SMC for loss of use of a creative organ under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) in connection with her FSAD. 

With the Veteran's VA Form 10182, she argued, similarly to above, that her SMC was related to her continuously pursued ovarian cyst disorder, and thus, the November 30, 2020 effective date should likewise be preserved.  The questions before the Board remain the same: First, when did the Veteran file her continuously pursued claim?  And, second, when did entitlement to SMC arise?  The proper effective date will be the later of these two dates.  

Turning to the first question, the Board has concluded herein that the Veteran's continuously pursued claim was initially filed on November 30, 2020.  

Turning to the second question, the Board must decide when entitlement arose for SMC.  Here, the Veteran is currently in receipt of SMC(k), for loss of use of a creative organ, but the record does not contain lay or medical evidence indicating that she is housebound, requires aid and attendance, or that her disabilities result in anatomical loss of use of a limb, blindness or deafness.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s), (l), (k).  Instead, she is entitled to SMC(k) due to the diagnosis of FSAD, which was first rendered at the June 17, 2022 VA examination.  

At the June 17, 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported, for the first time, that she was experiencing vaginal dryness which interfered with her ability to engage in intercourse.  After that, the examiner diagnosed her with FSAD.  Prior to this date, all available records, to include the March 2021 VA examination, were silent as to any reports of issues during intercourse or vaginal dryness.  Thus, the Board concludes that the date entitlement arose is June 17, 2022.

In this case, the correct effective date must align with the later of the two dates, November 30, 2020 and June 17, 2022, because the Veteran continuously pursued the claim.  Therefore, the proper effective date is June 17, 2022.  However, as the RO has afforded the Veteran the benefit of an earlier effective date, April 8, 2022, the date that her second ITF was filed, the Board will leave this favorable finding undisturbed but cannot find a legal basis to grant an earlier effective date.  The appeal is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
