REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent prior to April 25, 2023, and 40 percent thereafter, for lumbar sprain is remanded.

Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy, femoral nerve is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Although the Board regrets the additional delay, a remand is necessary to ensure that due process is followed and that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claim so that he is afforded every possible consideration.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159. 

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 2005 to March 2009.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. The February 2024 decision is a higher-level review of a June 2023 rating decision.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent prior to April 25, 2023, and 40 percent thereafter, for lumbar sprain is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his lumbar sprain disability warrants higher ratings for the entire period on appeal.

The period on appeal for AMA claims begins with the date of claim or the one year look back period, if applicable. In this case, the date of claim is the Veteran's April 25, 2023 claim on VA Form 21-526EZ. Therefore, the period on appeal is from April 25, 2022 (one year prior to the Veteran's claim date) until February 6, 2024 (rating decision regarding increased rating for the Veteran's lumbar sprain).

At the Veteran's November 2023 VA spine examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran is currently receiving steroid injections and physical therapy for his lumbar sprain as well as taking over the counter medication. Additionally, at the Veteran's May 2023 VA spine examination, it was noted that the Veteran takes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and prescribed medication. 

On March 12, 2025, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) issued a precedential decision in Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798. The Court found that the Board must discuss the beneficial effects of medication used to treat the Veteran's disabilities and whether any medications provide an ameliorative effect. Therefore, a remand is warranted for an addendum opinion for a VA examiner to discuss beneficial medication effects and evaluate the baseline severity of the Veteran's lumbar sprain. 

2. Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy, femoral nerve is remanded.

The Board finds that the claim of entitlement to an increased rating for left lower extremity radiculopathy is inextricably intertwined with the issue of an increased rating for lumbar sprain. As a result, the issue regarding the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy may not be adjudicated until the adjudication of the issue of an increased rating for the Veteran's lumbar spine is undertaken. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991). Therefore, this issue must also be remanded.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion by an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of the Veteran's service-connected lumbar sprain as well as the baseline severity of the Veteran's lumbar sprain discounting the ameliorative effects of any medication taken for this disability. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.

?

A complete rationale must be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed. If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
