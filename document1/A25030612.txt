INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from June 2009 to February 2010.

In March 2024, the Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision which addressed the above-noted issues.  Later that month, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), wherein he sought to appeal the claims in the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) System.  He selected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the RO issued the March 2024 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

However, because the Board is remanding the above-referenced claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the readjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c)(2)(ii).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802, unless an issue on appeal can be granted in full, the Board shall remand the appeal to the agency of original jurisdiction for correction of an error on the part of the agency of original jurisdiction to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction decision on appeal.  The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 the Department of Veterans Affairs must provide assistance in developing a veteran's claim.  This regulation requires VA to obtain records in the custody of a Federal department or agency.  Such evidence includes VA treatment records constructively received during the relevant appeal period.  Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348, 1354-55 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  The failure to provide the above-noted assistance constitutes a due process violation.

As noted above, the RO issued the rating decision under appeal in March 2024.  In that decision, the RO indicated records from the Shreveport VAMC were obtained and reviewed for the period from July 2023 to September 2023; however, the Board notes additional records were obtained from that facility in May 2024.  These records show additional records existed from September 2023 to March 2024, which were highly relevant to the matters on appeal.  In particular, these records show the Veteran obtained additional mental therapy, as well as a September 27, 2023, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of his thoracolumbar spine.  This study squarely calls into question the January 2024 VA examiner's conclusion that there was "no pathology to warrant a diagnosis."  Given these pertinent records existed and were indeed in the constructive possession of the RO at the time the March 2024 rating decision was rendered, they should have been considered.  Based on the foregoing pre-decisional duty to assist errors, the Board finds a remand is necessary.

Accordingly, these matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1.  Undertake appropriate development to obtain any outstanding records pertinent to the Veteran's claims, to specifically include any missing records from the Shreveport VAMC.  If any requested records are not available, the record should be annotated to reflect such and the Veteran notified in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (e).

2.  Thereafter, the RO should initiate any additionally indicated development, and then readjudicate the Veteran's claims.
