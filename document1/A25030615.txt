DOCKET NO. 240805-462368
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issues of entitlement to earlier effective dates for service connection for depressive disorder and right and left knee disabilities is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In August 2024 the Veteran died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1972 to July 1974. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued in October 2023 and July 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. 

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claims at this time and must dismiss this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claims. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

In this case, no one has requested to substitute for the Veteran. Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant." The form and filing instructions are available online at https://www.va.gov/find-forms/. If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the Veteran's death and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).
