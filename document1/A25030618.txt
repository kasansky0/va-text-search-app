ORDER

An initial rating higher than 10 percent for right ankle instability with tendonitis is denied.

An initial compensable rating for a right ankle scar is denied.

An initial compensable rating for right lower extremity neuropathy is denied.

Service connection for a left Achilles tendon tear is granted.

Service connection for a right popliteal nerve block is denied.

Service connection for a left leg neurological disability, claimed as numbness and tingling, is denied.

Service connection for right lower extremity chronic swelling is denied.

Service connection for left lower extremity chronic swelling is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Right ankle instability with tendonitis is not manifested by plantar flexion less than 10 degrees or dorsiflexion less than 5 degrees.

2. The right ankle scar measures 5 cm. by 1 cm., and is not painful, unstable, or associated with underlying soft tissue damage.

3. Right lower extremity neuropathy is manifested by mild incomplete paralysis of the anterior tibial (deep peroneal) nerve and intermittent pain.

4. A left Achilles tendon tear is due to a service-connected right Achilles tendon rupture.

5. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a disability associated with a right popliteal nerve block at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

6. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a disability associated with left lower extremity numbness and tingling at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

7. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a disability associated with right lower extremity swelling at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

8. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a disability associated with left lower extremity swelling at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had service in the Army National Guard, with active service from May 2018 to May 2019.

Initial rating decisions were issued in September 2022; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the prior decisions.  However, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) determined that additional development of the claims was warranted.  In March 2024, it issued a supplemental rating decision.

In her July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for a left lower extremity neurological disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The recent case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), held that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  In this case, more than 60 days have passed since the Veteran filed his Notice of Disagreement, and more than one year has passed since the rating decision on appeal was issued.  Therefore, the Board may proceed with a decision.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity and individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Right ankle instability with tendonitis

The Veteran's right ankle disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5271, for limitation of motion of the ankle.  Under Diagnostic Code 5271, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle (less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion).  A 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion).

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating higher than 10 percent because dorsiflexion measured 10 degrees and plantar flexion measured 30 degrees on an August 2022 VA examination.  These measurements include limitations associated with repetitive use over time and flare-ups.  Thus, the Veteran's disability does not meet the plain criteria corresponding to a higher 20 percent rating.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due precipitated by movement and use.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and functional loss, the degree of additional limitation contemplated by her statements are encompassed in the assigned 10 percent rating.

The Board has considered whether any other Diagnostic Codes related to disabilities of the ankle would provide for a higher disability rating.  However, the evidence does not reflect that the Veteran has been diagnosed with os calcis or astragalus of the ankle.  She has not been diagnosed with ankylosis and has not described limitations consistent with the functional equivalent of ankylosis.  Therefore, a rating higher than the current 10 percent is not warranted.

Right ankle scar

The Veteran's right ankle scar is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802.

DC 7802 is for burn scars or scars due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  A single 10 percent rating is assigned if the scar affects an area of 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or more.

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31. 

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7802 because the Veteran's right ankle scar is not manifest by an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  She underwent a VA examination in August 2022 which measured the scar at 5 cm. by 1 cm, or 5 sq. cm. in total.  The examiner further noted that the scar was not painful, not unstable, and not associated with any underlying soft tissue damage.  Therefore, none of the other DCs relevant to scars are applicable.  Notably, any limitation of motion associated with the scar is already contemplated by the rating for limitation of motion discussed above.

From the evidence of record, there is no basis upon which a compensable rating can be assigned for the right ankle scar.

Right lower extremity neuropathy

The Veteran's right lower extremity is currently assigned a 0 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8523, which addresses paralysis of the anterior tibial (deep peroneal nerve).  Neuritis and neuralgia of that group are evaluated under DCs 8623 and 8723.

Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 0 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

Neuritis, cranial or peripheral, characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain, at times excruciating, is to be rated on the scale provided for injury of the nerve involved, with a maximum equal to severe, incomplete, paralysis. The maximum rating which may be assigned for neuritis not characterized by organic changes referred to in this section will be that for moderate, or with sciatic nerve involvement, for moderately severe, incomplete paralysis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.123.  Neuralgia, cranial or peripheral, characterized usually by a dull and intermittent pain, of typical distribution to identify the nerve, is to be rated on the same scale, with a maximum equal to moderate incomplete paralysis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124.

Although the Board is not bound by administrative manuals, it is relevant for guidance as to determining the severity of the Veteran's radiculopathy during the appeal period.  See Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257 (2018).  VA's administrative manual provides guidance on the terms of mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe incomplete paralysis.  See VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (the "M21-1"), Part V.iii.12.A.2.c.

Mild incomplete paralysis is the default assigned based on symptoms, however slight, if they are sufficient to support the diagnosis for service connection purposes.  The disability is generally limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area.  A very minimal reflex or motor abnormality could potentially also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.

Moderate incomplete paralysis is when symptoms will likely be described and medically graded as significantly disabling in sensory-only cases.  Combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or weakness or diminished reflexes graded as medically moderate also fall into this category.

In this case, a compensable rating is not warranted.  The Veteran underwent a VA examination in August 2022.  The examiner noted normal objective findings for strength, sensation, and reflexes.  Subjective symptoms included mild intermittent pain, mild paresthesias, and mild numbness.  The examiner diagnosed an overall mild level of incomplete paralysis of the anterior tibial (deep peroneal) nerve.  The absence of any objective findings, coupled with the lower-graded subjective symptoms, falls squarely within the characterization of "mild" incomplete paralysis, consistent with the assigned 0 percent rating.

Nerve pain is a symptom specifically listed in the regulations as characterizing neuritis and neuralgia, whereas incomplete paralysis contemplates impaired function.  Banschbach v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 422 (2024).  In this case, the VA examination documented intermittent pain, which could be consistent with neuralgia as defined above.  As also noted above, the maximum rating to be assigned to neuralgia is the equivalent of moderate incomplete paralysis.  Here, however, that pain was identified as mild.  Therefore, it equates to no more than mild under DC 8523, which is still a 0 percent rating.  Therefore, a separate rating under DC 8723 for neuralgia is not appropriate.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted on a secondary basis for a disability that is due to or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury.  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show that (1) a current disability exists and (2) the current disability was either (a) caused by or (2) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc); see also Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (invalidating the requirement of "proximate cause" and instead holding "but for" causation or aggravation is enough to show entitlement to secondary service connection).

Left Achilles tendon tear

The Veteran was diagnosed with a left Achilles tendon tear in April 2022.  She contends this is secondary to her service-connected right Achilles tendon rupture.  

During service, the Veteran was seen for insidious left ankle pain in June 2018.  This was noted to be the contralateral side compared to the right Achilles tear she experienced one month earlier.  More recently, she reported injuring her left ankle while working out in January 2022 and was later diagnosed with a left Achilles tear.

A September 2022 VA examiner stated that the injury to the opposing joint, the right Achilles tendon in this case, would cause the left side to compensate with respect to ambulation and stability, which would worsen the left side.  In contrast, a January 2024 VA examiner stated that the left Achilles tendon tear was the result of an independent injury in January 2022.  This examiner did not address the aggravation prong of secondary service connection.

Upon review of the record, including the June 2018 service treatment record and the September 2022 VA opinion, the Board finds the evidence to at least be approximately balanced as to whether the Veteran's current left Achilles tendon tear is due to the service-connected right Achilles tendon tear.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for the left Achilles tendon tear is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Right popliteal nerve block

The Veteran underwent surgery in May 2018 for her right ankle injury.  As part of that surgery, she was administered a right popliteal nerve block, which is a form of regional anesthesia achieved by making extraneural or paraneural injections of anesthetics near the nerve whose conductivity is to be cut off.  See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 231 (31st ed. 2007).  In other words, a right popliteal nerve block is a medical procedure, not a disability.  Therefore, service connection is not appropriate.

The Board has considered whether the Veteran may be claiming a residual of this procedure.  However, she is already service-connected for right lower extremity neuropathy.  The August 2022 VA examination which addressed the peripheral nerves did not diagnose a disability specific to the popliteal nerve.  Therefore, there is no current disability upon which a claim can be based.

Left leg neurological disability, claimed as numbness and tingling

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis related to a left leg neurological disability and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The August 2022 VA examiner determined that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of a left leg neurological disability, nor is there any such diagnosis elsewhere in the evidence of record.  The Board has considered Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), which held that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."  Id. at 1367-69.

In this case, the August 2022 VA examination was silent for any left leg symptoms.  Moreover, beyond the bare assertion of service connection, the Veteran has not put forth any statements regarding the nature of her claimed disability.  Her claim itself, styled as numbness and tingling, does not establish impairment of earning capacity.  In the absence of a current disability, service connection is not warranted.

Right lower extremity chronic swelling

Left lower extremity chronic swelling

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis related to right or left leg swelling and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.

The August 2022 VA examiner determined that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of a right or left leg vascular disability, including varicose veins, post-phlebitic syndrome, peripheral artery disease, Raynaud's disease, or aneurysm.  There is also no such diagnosis elsewhere in the evidence of record.  The Board has again considered Saunders v. Wilkie.  In this case, the August 2022 VA examination was silent for any left leg symptoms.  During the examination, the Veteran reported random swelling in the bilateral lower extremities, which does not establish any impairment of earning capacity.  In the absence of a current disability, service connection is not warranted.
