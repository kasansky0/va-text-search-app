ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for an eye injury disorder is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran failed to report to scheduled VA examinations and has not shown good cause for his failure to appear and has not requested that the examinations be rescheduled.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has a bilateral hearing loss disability for VA purposes at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had an eye disorder at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385, 3.655.

2. The criteria for service connection for an eye injury disorder have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.655.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty for training from February 2008 to July 2008, and on active duty from April 2009 to November 2009 and from April 2010 to February 2011.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in July 2023 and May 2024 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

The Board notes that on April 21, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the July 2023 decision for the issues of service connection for hearing loss sensorineural and bipolar disorder with schizophrenia. 

On April 29, 2024, the AOJ issued an HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2023 decision, and again denied the claim. 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket and identified the July 2023 AOJ decision for the issues of service connection for hearing loss sensorineural and bipolar disorder with schizophrenia. 

Although the April 2022 HLR decision was issued closer in time to the Veteran's June 2024 VA Form 10182, because the Form 10182 was filed within a year of the July 2023 AOJ decision, the Board finds that the Veteran timely appealed the July 2023 AOJ decision. This finding does not prejudice the Veteran as the April 2024 HLR decision considered evidence at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.

The Board also notes that in August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of service connection for hearing loss sensorineural, bipolar disorder with schizophrenia, and eye injury. 

Concurrent jurisdiction is prohibited under the AMA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). An appellant may change appeal options by submitting a written withdrawal of the initial appeal option and filing the appropriate application for the new review option within one year from the date on which VA issued notice of the decision on an issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(e). In this case, as the Veteran did not submit a withdrawal of his June 2024 VA Form 10182 prior to or at the time of filing his August 2024 request for Supplemental Claim review, the Board will proceed to adjudicate his appeal.

The Board further notes that in the June 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran listed 16 additional issues that were decided in 2012, 2015, and 2016. Those issues stem from unappealed rating actions issued beyond the one-year period for appeal. The Veteran noted on the Form 10182 that "I'm trying to get the extension because I know I need help." The Veteran did not provide a good cause explanation as to why he could not file an appeal within the appropriate appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b). As such, those issues are not properly before the Board.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision for the issues of service connection for hearing loss sensorineural and bipolar disorder with schizophrenia, and at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision for the issue of service connection for eye injury. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for bipolar disorder with schizophrenia, now recharacterized as service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). "To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"- the so-called "nexus" requirement." Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Additional disabilities resulting from the aggravation of a nonservice connected condition by a service-connected condition is also compensable under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).

Certain chronic diseases (including sensorineural hearing loss) will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The veteran can provide competent reports of factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, such as experiencing pain in service, reporting to sick call, being placed on limited duty, and undergoing physical therapy. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a lay person is competent to identify the medical condition (noting that sometimes the lay person will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer), (2) the lay person is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Similarly, laypersons are competent to diagnose and provide nexus opinions to some extent, notably where the diagnosis or opinion is not of a complex nature. Id., see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a), when entitlement to a benefit cannot be established without a current VA examination or reexamination, and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination or reexamination, action shall be taken in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.655 (b) or (c) as appropriate. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b), when a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with an original compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record, but when a claimant fails to report without good cause for an examination scheduled in conjunction with a reopened claim or a claim for increase, the claim shall be denied. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant, and death of an immediate family member, etc. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. Bilateral Hearing Loss 

The Veteran contends that he has sensorineural hearing loss due to exposure to explosives in service. See April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

The AOJ has favorably found that the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of security forces has high probability for hazardous noise exposure. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current hearing loss disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of hearing loss and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

Impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385

Impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran's service treatment records do not reveal a diagnosis of hearing loss for VA purposes. After service, the Veteran's VA and private treatments records generally show normal hearing bilaterally.

The Veteran's VA and private records during or approximate to the pendency of the claim do not reveal a diagnosis of hearing loss disability for VA purposes, and they are also devoid of an audiological evaluation. The record shows he last underwent a VA examination for hearing loss in June 2015. The pure tone thresholds and the speech audiometry results did not indicate a diagnosis of hearing loss:

Jun. 2015	HERTZ

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	CNC

RIGHT	20	20	15	30	25	96

LEFT	20	15	20	20	15	100

The record shows the Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination for hearing loss in May 2023, but he failed to report to the exam. The Veteran did not provide a good cause for failing to attend the exam. He was scheduled for another VA examination in June 2023, but he did not report to the exam. He did not provide a good cause for failing to attend the exam. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 406 (1991). In such case, the Board decides the claim based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655. Unfortunately, the evidence of record does not reveal a diagnosis of hearing loss for VA purposes.

The Veteran did not report to that scheduled examination. There is no indication that he was not notified of it. When a veteran fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with an original compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

While the Veteran believes he has a current diagnosis of hearing loss, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The medical evidence does not reflect a current hearing loss disability as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Service connection is not warranted at this time. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The service and post-service treatment records are otherwise negative for complaints, treatments or diagnoses related to bilateral hearing loss. Further, the evidence does not indicate that his claimed bilateral hearing loss may be related to his military service. See McLendon v. Nicholson, supra. In this regard, while the Veteran himself has advanced such a theory, a mere conclusory generalized lay statement that service event or illness caused the claimant's current condition is insufficient to require the Secretary to provide an examination. See Waters v. Shinseki, supra. The Court has held that VA is not required to provide a medical examination when there is not credible evidence of an event, injury, or disease in service. See Bardwell v. Shinseki, supra. Therefore, the Board finds that a VA examination and/or opinion is not necessary to decide this claim.

The Board acknowledges the statements of the Veteran as to the existence and etiology of bilateral hearing loss and acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to give evidence about what he experienced. However, while the Veteran is competent to report his current symptoms, as a lay person he does not have the education, training, experience to diagnose or opine as to the etiology of the conditions. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, supra.

After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted for bilateral hearing loss as there is no adequate medical evidence indicating such disorder is etiologically related to his active service. 

Upon review of the above evidence, the Board finds that service connection for an bilateral hearing loss is not warranted on a direct or presumptive basis. First, there is no evidence of any such disorder in service or its onset within one year of service discharge. As noted above, the Veteran's service treatment records are negative for any complaints of, treatment for, or diagnosis related to bilateral hearing loss. As there is no medical evidence in the record that links the Veteran's claimed bilateral hearing loss to an incident of the Veteran's active military service. While an additional medical examination and opinion would have been helpful with regard to this claim, VA has been unable to obtain such an examination and/or opinion. As above, given the Veteran's failure to report for the scheduled examination, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

While the Veteran may believe his bilateral hearing loss symptoms had its onset in service or is the result of service, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis or nexus opinion regarding this issue. The issues are medically complex, as it requires knowledge of anatomical and psychiatric functions and limits. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that he has the skills or medical training to make such a determination. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, supra; see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011). Therefore, the Veteran is not competent to provide an etiology opinion in this case.

Accordingly, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted. The appeal is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

2. Eye Injury Disorder

The Veteran contends that he has an eye injury due to a bullet ricocheting to his eye in service. See April 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ.

The AOJ has not made any favorable findings. The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current eye disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of an eye disability and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky, 26 Vet. App. at 294; McClain, 21 Vet. App. at 321.

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for any injury to his eyes. They generally noted that his eyes were normal. After service, his treatment records are silent for an eye condition until 2016.

A February 2016 VA record noted that the Veteran was assaulted by his girlfriend's cousin's boyfriend, and had a right orbital eye surgery; he stated his vision appears good and not compromised. In an addendum note, the he reported he underwent surgery for orbital fractures and received a "titanium plate under right eye, sutures to right eyebrow, and sutures inside mouth." Thereafter, his VA records generally show that his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERRLA), and that he has mild myopic astigmatism.

The Veteran's VA and private treatment records during or approximate to the pendency of the claim do not reveal a diagnosis of an eye disability.

Of note, although a March 2024 record shows the Veteran reported eye pain and that he has "parasite" in his brain due to a previous gunshot in his eye in 2011, the primary diagnosis was hallucinations. Similarly, a December 2024 VA treatment noted the Veteran felt something in his eye and went to remove it with a knife, but it further noted that he was having delusions and was not compliant with his medication. Physical examinations of his eyes during VA visits throughout the appeal period did not reveal an eye disability.

While the Veteran believes he had a current diagnosis of an eye disability, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board notes that the VA did not provide the Veteran with an examination for the purposes of determining the etiology of his claimed eye disability; however, one was not required at the time of the AOJ decision. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). McLendon provides that in disability compensation (service connection) claims, VA must provide a medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the VA to make a decision on the claim. The standards of McLendon are not met in this case as there is no competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and no evidence to of an in-service eye injury.

In the absence of proof of a present eye disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection. Brammer, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). There is no doubt to be resolved in this case. Service connection for eye injury is not warranted at this time. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Acquired Psychiatric Disorder

The Veteran contends that he started to notice very mild schizophrenia and bipolar symptoms in service, which have become very severe now. See April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. He stated that he saw dead people and animals during active service, and that he could not sleep the same ever since. Id. He also stated that he has PTSD is related to feared hostile military or terrorist activity. Id.

The AOJ has favorably found that the Veteran has been diagnosed with depression in service, and that his private records from El Paso Behavioral noted current diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety disorder. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Consistent with the medical evidence, the claim for service connection for bipolar disorder with schizophrenia has been recharacterized as a claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

A review of the claims file suggests that the Veteran has a psychiatric disability that may be related to his active service.

A March 2023 VA record noted that the Veteran was involuntarily admitted to El Paso Behavioral Health due to verbal and physical aggression toward family, and that he "reports hx [history] of PTSD of putting bodies on planes"; the primary diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. An addendum VA record noted that the Veteran reported he has PTSD due to putting bodies on planes while in the Air Force and also in part because his younger brother suffered 3rd degree burn and had to endure and witness all the wound care and pain that his brother suffered. A March 2023 private record from El Paso Behavioral Health System noted the Veteran has a history of PTSD due to time served in the air force, and that he had experienced symptoms of flashbacks, nightmares, and hypervigilance.

Given the current diagnoses of psychiatric disorders, in-service diagnosis of depression, the Veteran's assertion that his psychiatric disability is related to service, to include carrying dead bodies on planes, and insufficient competent medical evidence to make a decision, a VA examination was warranted prior to the July 2023 AOJ decision. See McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 79.

The record shows Veteran was scheduled a VA examination for mental disorders on May 4, 2023, but he failed to attend. In a May 2023 VA Form 27-0820, the Veteran stated he missed the examination on May 4, 2023 because "he was unable to access the link. The Veteran will make the rescheduled exam." Resolving any doubt, a plausible basis for good cause was shown. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a). A review of the claims file does not show that another VA examination was scheduled for the Veteran prior to the denial of the claim in July 2023. The AOJ's failure to provide another opportunity to appear at a VA examination constituted a pre-decisional duty to assist error that warrants a remand.

The Board also notes that there is no indication that the AOJ has attempted to verify the Veteran's reported stressors. The AOJ's failure to verify the reported stressors is a pre-decisional duty to assist error. On remand, attempts should be made to verify his reported stressors, to include carrying dead bodies and having feared hostile military or terrorist activity during active service, and whether he engaged in combat during his active service.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Take all steps deemed appropriate to verify the Veteran's claimed stressors during active service, to include carrying dead bodies and having feared hostile military or terrorist activity. Verify whether the Veteran engaged in combat during his active service.

2. Then, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his acquired psychiatric disorders, to include MDD, PTSD, anxiety disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. After a thorough review of the claims file, including this Remand, the examiner should respond to the following:

(a)	The examiner must identify all psychiatric disorders diagnosed during or approximate to the pendency of the appeal (since around April 2023). For any psychiatric disorder that is noted in VA or private treatment records but not found on current examination, the examiner should attempt to reconcile these findings.

(b)	If the Veteran is diagnosed with PTSD, the examiner must explain how the diagnostic criteria are met and whether PTSD is at least as likely as not related to a verified stressor reported by the Veteran.

(c)	For any other currently diagnosed psychiatric disorders, the examiner must opine whether the disorder at least as likely as not had its onset in active service or is otherwise related to his active service.

In rendering any opinion, the examiner should consider the Veteran's lay statements, reports of onset and continuity of symptoms, and past history of treatment.

A rationale should be provided for all opinions offered.

?

The medical opinion must support the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate to consider and weigh against other evidence of record; medical opinions must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. If an opinion cannot be expressed without resort to speculation, ensure that the clinician so indicates and discusses why an opinion is not possible, to include whether there is additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.
