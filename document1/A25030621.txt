DOCKET NO. 240711-454302
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is denied.

Service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a TBI at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. PTSD is etiologically related to a fall in service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a TBI have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Navy from March 1997 to July 1998.

An initial rating decision was issued in June 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the prior decision.  That same month, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 decision.

In his July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

In his May 2023 claim, the Veteran identified PTSD as the disability being claimed.  However, he also referenced a July 2013 rating decision, which denied service connection for a TBI.  The AOJ styled the claim as service connection for a TBI with symptoms of depression, memory loss, and trouble sleeping in its June 2023 and July 2023 rating decisions.  However, the Veteran continued to seek service connection for PTSD in his HLR request and Notice of Disagreement.  Therefore, the Board will adjudicate service connection for both disabilities.

Service connection for a TBI

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a TBI and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

A March 2013 VA examiner evaluated the Veteran but concluded that he did not have a TBI or any residuals of a TBI.  Further, despite VA outpatient treatment from 2014 through 2023, his records do not contain a diagnosis of a TBI, and neither the Veteran nor his representative have identified any competent medical diagnosis of a TBI.  To the extent that he has asserted the presence of such a diagnosis himself, the Veteran has not shown the necessary medical knowledge or training to provide a competent diagnosis in this case.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized knowledge of pathology and the ability to interpret diagnostic medical testing.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In the absence of a current disability, service connection is not warranted.

Service connection for PTSD

Service connection for PTSD requires (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); (2) credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor occurred; and (3) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and the in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f); Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

VA treatment records from January 2019, December 2022, and June 2023 document a current diagnosis of PTSD.  The Veteran claims an in-service stressor of falling down a "shaft alley" during service.  During his service separation examination in January 1998, he reported being more "shaken up and nervous" due to this fall, noting that his injuries healed by the fall made him more "panicky."  Although the details related to this fall have not been consistent, he has continuously reported a history of a fall in service since his discharge.  Therefore, the Board finds there is credible evidence of the occurrence of this in-service stressor.

Finally, the Veteran's treating provider noted in December 2022 that the Veteran had symptoms consistent with PTSD with the in-service fall as the relevant trauma.  Resolving any doubts in his favor, the Board finds that a link between the current disability and the in-service stressor has been established, and service connection for PTSD is warranted.
