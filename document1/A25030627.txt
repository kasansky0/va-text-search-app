REMANDED

Service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran, who is the Appellant, served on active duty from February 1969 to May 1971. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2020 rating decision from the Regional Office (RO).  In the November 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Service connection for sleep apnea was previously before the Board in February 2024, during which the Board denied service connection for sleep apnea.  The Veteran appealed the matter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In a November 2024 Joint Motion for Remand (JMR), the parties agreed that a remand was warranted for the Board to remand the matter to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the October 2020 rating decision on appeal.  Specifically, it does not appear that the VA Form 21-526EZ the Veteran used to submit his claim included notice of a right to a pre-decisional hearing before the RO prior to October 2020 AOJ rating decision.  The AOJ did not provide notice of a right to a pre-decisional hearing before the RO until after the October 2020 AOJ rating decision was issued.  See October 2020 Notification Letter. 

As such the parties agreed that VA did not meet its regulatory duties in the development and adjudication of the claim, including notice of the right to a pre-decisional hearing before VA issued notice of a decision.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(e)(1); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103(d)(1), 20.802(a); see also Bryant v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 43, 46 (2020) (holding appellants have a right to fair process in the development and adjudication of their claims and appeals before VA, including notice and an opportunity to respond). 

Therefore, service connection for sleep apnea is remanded for the AOJ to provide the Veteran notice of the right to a pre-decisional hearing and then readjudicate the claim. 

Service connection for sleep apnea is REMANDED for the following action:

1. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) should send the Veteran VCAA notice of the right to a hearing prior to issuance of an AOJ decision on the matter. 

2. Then readjudicate the claim for service connection for sleep apnea based on the evidence of record, including determining whether the duty to assist requires any additional evidentiary development prior to readjudication of the issue on appeal.
