DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal seeking a rating in excess of 40 percent for thoracic outlet syndrome status post-surgery is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In correspondence dated and associated with the claims file in March 2025, and prior to the requested hearing and the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran withdrew his appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal and dismissal of the appeal seeking a rating in excess of 40 percent for thoracic outlet syndrome status post-surgery have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1998 to November 2003.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2021; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  The July 2021 rating decision, in pertinent part, increased the evaluation of the Veteran's thoracic outlet syndrome status post-surgery from 20 percent to 40 percent, effective June 26, 2017.  

In his July 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket and requested review of only the evaluation of his thoracic outlet syndrome status post-surgery.  The requested hearing was originally scheduled for December 13, 2024, and subsequently rescheduled to April 7, 2025, at the Veteran's request.  See September 2024 Hearing notification letter; December 2024 Motion to Reschedule Hearing; and January 2025 Hearing notification letter.  However, in March 2025, and prior to the date of the rescheduled hearing, the Veteran informed VA that he was satisfied with his current benefits and therefore requested to withdraw his pending appeal and hearing.  See March 2025 VA Form 21-0820 Report of General Information.  A few days later, also in March 2025, the Veteran submitted written correspondence stating that he wished to withdraw his appeal and listed the docket number.  Thus, the Veteran's hearing request is also deemed withdrawn. 

Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  The Federal Circuit has not addressed the criteria as to a written request to withdraw a claim.  See Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009, 1013, n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  

As discussed above, in a signed statement dated March 25, 2025, the Veteran clearly indicated his intent to withdraw this appeal by submitting written correspondence. In that written correspondence, the Veteran included his name, VA file number, and this docket number.  The Board has no basis to question the validity of the withdrawal or the Veteran's understanding of the consequences of withdrawing the appeal.  Cf. Delisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011).

Thus, there remains no allegations of error of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
