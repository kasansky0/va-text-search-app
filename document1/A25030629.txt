REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1988 to August 1992. 

This case is being reviewed according to the appellate process set forth under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 169 (Jan. 18, 2019); 38 C.F.R. § 19.2.

This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from April 2024 and October 2024 rating decisions from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  The Veteran submitted a December 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement and selected the Direct Review Option.  

Here, the Board notes that the service connection claim for tinnitus was originally on appeal.  However, in a February 2025 rating decision, the Regional Office (RO) granted service connection for this claim, representing a full grant of benefits. Accordingly, this issue is no longer before the Board.  The only remaining issues on appeal are listed on the title page.

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is dismissed.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a white lesion on the brain is dismissed.

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).

In the present case, the Veteran's attorney submitted written correspondence on February 24, 2025, requesting to withdraw the present appeal to the Board.  The withdrawal is in writing and contains the Veteran's name, VA claims file number, a statement indicating that the Veteran wished to withdraw "all pending claims" before the Board, and specifically referenced the December 24, 2024, VA Form 10182.  Based on the foregoing, the Board finds the Veteran, via his attorney, expressed a clear and unambiguous intent to withdraw this appeal; therefore, all requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 have been met.  Accordingly, appeal is dismissed.
