ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for regular aid and attendance (A&A)/housebound status is dismissed.

Entitlement to specially adapted housing is denied.

Entitlement to a special home adaptation grant is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's July 2024 VA Form 10182 was not timely filed as to the June 2017 decision denying entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular A&A/housebound status.

2. The evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has a service-connected disability rated as permanent and total, which includes, or is due to: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; blindness in both eyes; the anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands or upper extremities; the loss or loss of use of both lower extremities; the loss of use of one lower extremity with residuals of organic disease or injury or loss or loss of use of one upper extremity which so affect balance and propulsion as to preclude unaided locomotion; burns of any depth or thickness; or residuals of an inhalation injury.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular A&A/housebound status have been met.  8 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. 

§ 20.203.

2. The criteria for entitlement to specially adapted housing have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 2101, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.809, 3.809a.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a special home adaptation grant have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 2101, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.809, 3.809a.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2005 to September 2005.  

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. The appeal for entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular A&A/housebound status

In June 2017, the Veteran was issued a decision that denied entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular A&A/housebound status.  The Veteran was notified of this decision in a letter dated June 29, 2017.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 for this issue in July 2024, seven years after the issuance of the June 2017 rating decision.  The Board acknowledged receipt of the Veteran's VA Form 10182 appeal in a July 2024 letter. The letter included the following information:

Although your appeal has been docketed, it is possible that upon more detailed review the Board will determine your appeal request did not meet the necessary procedural requirements.  Those procedural requirements may include, but are not limited to, timely submitting your appeal request and adequately completing the VA Form 10182.  If the Board identifies such a defect, it may issue a decision dismissing your appeal based on that defect.

As the Veteran was informed in the June 2017 notice, governing law and regulation provides claimants with one year in which to contest a denial decision.  38 U.S.C. 

§ 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

Because the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was filed more than one year after the June 2017 rating decision, the appeal regarding the claim for SMC is untimely.  The Veteran was informed of the potential and the consequences of untimely filing in the July 2024 letter.

In so holding, the Board observes that, in Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims referenced a notice of disagreement (NOD) under the legacy system as a "nonjurisdictional claims processing rule" and specifically stated that "[t]o the extent that any of our prior cases have held that the deadline for filing an NOD is jurisdictional, they are overruled."  This reasoning should also apply to an NOD under the Appeals Modernization Act.  As such, the Board clarifies that this appeal is not being dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, but rather for failure to comply with the claims processing rules.  Therefore, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 20.104 (c) do not apply.

The Veteran's appeal has been docketed at the Board.  However, as with any appellate system, the Board's mere administrative docketing of a claim does not demonstrate acceptance or waiver of a claims processing rule as it is a ministerial act.  See Martin v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1338, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

In this case, the Board has found that the Veteran did not submit a timely VA Form 10182 as to this particular issue of entitlement to SMC.  As such, the claim is dismissed for failure to comply with the appropriate claims processing rules regarding perfection of a Board appeal per 38 C.F.R. § 20.402.  38 U.S.C. § 7108.

In making this determination, the Board acknowledges that in August 2018, the Veteran attempted to file an NOD with the June 2017 rating decision under the legacy system.  However, an appeal as to this claim in the Legacy system was never perfected.

The Board notes that if the Veteran wishes to continue pursuing this claim, she is invited to file a supplemental claim along with a submission of new and relevant evidence to support the claim.

2. Entitlement to specially adapted housing

3. Entitlement to a special home adaptation grant

Issues 2-3:

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to specially adapted housing/special home adaption.  The Veteran claims that while she was at 100 percent disabled, she also had several appeals that were ongoing, and she had to spend all of her money to pay for taxes and to survive.  She required emergency funding to fix essential things such as the toilet, shower, kitchen, plumbing, and other things.  See September 2023 Buddy/Lay Statement (2x); September 2023 VA 26-4555 Veterans Application in Acquiring Specially Adapted Housing or Special Home Adaptation Grant Under Title 38 U.S.C. 2101(a) or (b).

Specially adapted housing is available to a Veteran who is entitled to compensation for permanent and total service-connected disability due to: (1) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis rated as 100 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8017; (2) blindness in both eyes, having only light perception, plus the anatomical loss or loss of use of one lower extremity; (3) full thickness or subdermal burns that have resulted in contractures with limitation of motion of two or more extremities or of at least one extremity and the trunk; or (4) the loss or loss of use of both upper extremities such as to preclude use of the arms at or above the elbows.  Specially adapted housing is also available to a Veteran with a permanent and total service-connected disability that precludes locomotion without the aids of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair due to: (5) the loss, or loss of use, of both lower extremities; (6) the loss or loss of use of one lower extremity, together with residuals of organic disease or injury which affect the functions of balance and propulsion; or, (7) the loss or loss of use of one lower extremity together with the loss or loss of use of one upper extremity which affect the functions of balance or propulsion.  38 U.S.C. § 2101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.809(a), (b), (d).

Specially adapted housing may also be available to a Veteran who served on or after September 11, 2001, who has a permanent disability that was incurred during such service, and which results in loss or loss of use of one or more extremities which so affects the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude ambulating without the aids of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair.  See 38 U.S.C. 

§ 2101(a)(2)(C).

If entitlement to specially adapted housing is not established, a Veteran can qualify for a grant for necessary special home adaptations if she has a service-connected disability that results in blindness in both eyes with 20/200 visual acuity or less in the better eye with the use of a standard correcting lens or a limitation in fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees; such a disability need not be permanent and total in nature.  Additionally, a special home adaptation grant is available for a Veteran that has a permanent and total disability which: (1) includes the anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands; (2) is due to deep partial thickness burns that have resulted in contracture(s) with limitation of motion of two or more extremities or of at least one extremity and the trunk; (3) is due to full thickness or subdermal burns that have resulted in contracture(s) of one or more extremities or the truck; or, (4) is due to residuals of an inhalation injury (including, but not limited to, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).  38 C.F.R. 

§ 3.809a(b).

The phrase "preclude locomotion" is defined as the necessity for regular and constant use of a wheelchair, braces, crutches, or canes as a normal mode of locomotion, although occasional locomotion by other methods may be possible.  38 C.F.R. § 3.809 (c).  Regarding "loss of use" in the context of specially adapted housing claims, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the term generally means "a deprivation of the ability to avail oneself of the anatomical region in question."  Jensen v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 66 (2017).  The Court also identified four elements that must be satisfied to establish entitlement to specially adapted housing based on loss of use of the lower extremities.  Specifically, the claimant must (1) have a permanent and total service-connected disability (2) due to a disorder that (3) involves both lower extremities and (4) causes a loss of use so severe that it precludes locomotion without the regular and constant use of assistive devices.  Id.

Generally, an eligible Veteran will be provided one-time only assistance with a special home adaptation grant or specially adapted housing.  However, issuance of a special home adaptation grant before a Veteran becomes eligible for specially adapted housing under 38 C.F.R. § 3.809 does not preclude a later grant for specially adapted housing.  38 C.F.R. § 3.809a(a).

The Veteran's sole service-connected disability is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at 100 percent disabling.  See February 2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet.

In a June 2017 VA examination for her PTSD, the VA examiner addressed the Veteran's activities of daily living (ADL).  It was noted that the Veteran's PTSD did not affect mobility; required no ambulation devices; and she did not suffer from imbalance.  See June 2017 C&P Exam.

In the August 2018 VA examination for her PTSD, it was noted she ambulated without the use of an assistive device.  See August 2018 C&P Exam.

VA treatment records from August 2023 show the Veteran required the use of a wheelchair with limited walking less than three blocks based on worsening of meralgia paresthetic over the past eight years.  See December 2023 CAPRI.

In January 2024, the Veteran reported she was almost completely bedridden due to nerve pain and PTSD.  She ambulated with a walker and wheelchair but on a very limited basis.  She stated she was worried about falling due to neuropathy in her feet.  See February 2024 CAPRI.

Upon review, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim for specially adapted housing and special home adaptation benefits are not warranted.  Notably, the Veteran's service-connected disability of PTSD does not involve amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, blindness or other any visual disability or disability from burns.  Thus, she cannot be awarded specially adapted housing based on the presence of any of these disabilities.

Also, the Veteran does not have any service-connected upper extremity disability, any service-connected residuals of organic disease affecting the functions of balance and propulsion or any service-connected disability of the right lower extremity.  Consequently, she cannot be awarded specially adapted housing for the loss or loss of use of both upper extremities, the loss or loss of use of one lower extremity, together with residuals of organic disease or injury which affect the functions of balance and propulsion; the loss or loss of use of one lower extremity together with the loss or loss of use of one upper extremity which affect the functions of balance or propulsion or the loss or loss of use of both lower extremities.

Next, the Veteran served on or after September 11, 2001, and is therefore entitled to consideration under 38 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(2)(C).  However, the evidence of record does not show she has a permanent service-connected disability which results in loss or loss of use of one or more extremities which so affects the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude ambulating without the aids of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair.

Accordingly, as a matter of law, the Veteran does not qualify for specially adapted housing.  38 U.S.C. §§ 2101(a), 2101(a)(2)(C); 38 C.F.R. § 3.809(a), (b), (d).

Given that the Veteran does not qualify for a specially adapted housing, the Board has also considered whether the Veteran could qualify for a special home adaptation grant.  However, once again, she does not have a service-connected disability that results in impaired vision, that involves the anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands, or that is due to any burns or inhalation injury.  Therefore, there is no basis for awarding the Veteran a special home adaptation grant.  38 U.S.C. 

§ 2101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.809a.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's use of a walker and wheelchair during the period on review.  However, VA examinations from June 2017 and August 2018 indicated the Veteran did not require the use of devices for ambulation, and VA treatment records show the Veteran reported requiring devices due to worsening meralgia paresthetic and neuropathy in her feet.  As the Veteran is only service connected for her PTSD and not meralgia paresthetic and neuropathy, the Board finds that the use of assistive devices is not applicable in this claim.

Accordingly, although the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt where the evidence is in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable where, as here, the weight of the evidence is against the claims for entitlement to specially adapted housing and for a special home adaptation grant.
