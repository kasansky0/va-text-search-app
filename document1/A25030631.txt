ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for hypertension is denied. 

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded. 

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded. 

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is remanded. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence weighs persuasively against a compensable rating for service-connected hypertension.

2. The Veteran's hypertension has not manifested in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.

3. The Veteran does not have a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103A, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1979 to October 1999. 

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January 2023 and February 2023 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 and February 2023 AOJ decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and an increased rating for COPD, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Disability Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of any disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Although the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings, the Board is to consider the Veteran's medical history in determining the applicability of a higher rating for the entire period in which the appeal has been pending. Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31, 34 (1999).

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous." Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time. Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings).

When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Hypertension 

The Veteran asserts entitlement to a compensable rating for the service-connected hypertension because he is prescribed two medications to control his blood pressure and even on medications, the "bottom number" (diastolic pressure) is "sometimes over 100." See September 2023 Correspondence. 

The Veteran's hypertension is currently rated as noncompensable (0 percent disabling) pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

Under Diagnostic Code 7101, a 10 percent rating for hypertension is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. A 20 percent disability evaluation for hypertension requires diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. A rating of 40 percent is assigned when diastolic pressure is predominantly 120 or more, and a rating of 60 percent is assigned when diastolic pressure is predominantly 130 or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

Neither the Rating Schedule nor the regulations provide a definition of the term "predominantly." In the absence of guidance, the Board will consider the term as it is commonly understood. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines predominantly to mean "for the most part: mainly." See Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominantly (last updated Dec. 7, 2024).

The "minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control," is intended to compensate veterans who do not have current readings establishing entitlement to a 10 percent rating if those veterans are using medication to control their blood pressure. Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75, 78 (2021). Diagnostic Code 7101 contemplates the ameliorative effects of medication and thus, a veteran can be entitled to a compensable rating even if he does not have current blood pressure readings above the statutory thresholds when there is a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more. McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 273 (2016).

Where, as here, the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31. 

In the instant case, the Veteran filed the claim seeking an increased rating for hypertension on September 9, 2023. Thus, the review period on appeal begins September 9, 2022, the date the increased rating claim was received plus consideration of the one-year look back period prior to the date of the filing of that claim. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010). However, because the Veteran is currently taking medication to control his hypertension, the Board must consider evidence prior to the period on appeal to evaluate the history of the Veteran's blood pressure.

Historically, the Veteran service treatment records (STRs) included multiple blood pressure readings of diastolic blood pressure of 90mm or greater and of systolic blood pressure of 160mm or greater.  A sampling of the Veteran's historical blood pressure readings are as follows: January 9, 1982 - 172/76 and 180/90; September 29, 1987 - 158/90 and 170/90; May 25, 1992 - 158/90 and 160/90; July 12, 1999- 160/106 and 156/94; July 14, 1999 - 160/100; July 20, 1999 - 140/90 and 138/92; July 21, 1999 - 132/96 and 138/96. 

The Veteran submitted private treatment records that included multiple blood pressure readings of diastolic blood pressure of 90mm or greater and of systolic blood pressure of 140mm or greater. A sampling of the Veteran's historical blood pressure readings are as follows: June 12, 2018 - 126/87; December 13, 2018 - 134/87, April 27, 2023 - 127/93; June 21, 2023 - 130/93; and August 22, 2023 - 121/90. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA hypertension examination in April 2019. The examiner noted that in 1999, the Veteran's hypertension was diagnosed during regular physical examination in the military, and the Veteran began medication at that time.  The Veteran reported taking continuous medication (Losartan) for hypertension.  Blood pressure readings on examination were 140/78, 138/80, and 138/82. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more.  

The Veteran was afforded another VA hypertension examination in December 2023. The Veteran reported using medications to include Losartan and Amlodipine. He reported occasional issues with headaches, breathing issues, and dizziness. Blood pressure readings on examination were 139/95, 139/93, and 136/91. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more.  

For the following reasons, the Board finds the most probative evidence of record weighs against a compensable rating for hypertension. The probative evidence does not reflect readings of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more during the appeal period.

Beginning September 9, 2022, the Veteran's medical records do not contain blood pressure readings with a diastolic pressure 100 or more. Accordingly, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's hypertension predominantly, or for the most part, manifested in diastolic pressure of 100 or more, or systolic pressure of 160 or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

The aforementioned blood pressure measurements constitute highly probative evidence weighing substantially against the claim. The Board also finds the April 2019 and December 2023 VA examinations are adequate. These examinations indicate that that while on continuous hypertension medications, the Veteran's diastolic pressure was predominantly below 100, and his systolic pressure was predominantly below 160. Consequently, the April 2019 and December 2023 VA examinations and findings are highly probative evidence that weighs persuasively against the claim.

In addition, the probative evidence demonstrates the Veteran has taken continuous medication for the management of his hypertension since 1999. See April 2019 VA Examination. However, the VA examiners opined the Veteran does not have a history of diastolic pressure to predominantly 100 or more. The Board finds that the medical evidence supports this conclusion.

As the Veteran was prescribed medication for hypertension while still on active duty, his STRs are relevant to the history of his disability. The Board acknowledges that the STRs show that the Veteran had two diastolic measurements over 100 on July 12, 1999 (160/106) and July 14, 1999 (160/100). However, the Board finds that two instances of diastolic readings above 100 does not constitute a finding that the Veteran has a history of diastolic pressure predominantly, or for the most part, 100 or more. Indeed, the STRs show that the Veteran's diastolic readings were "mainly" less than 100. 

The Board also considered the Veteran's lay contentions regarding the symptoms and impact of his hypertension, to include occasional headaches and dizziness. While the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, whether a disability meets the schedular criteria for the assignment of a higher rating is a factual determination by the Board based on the Veteran's complaints coupled with the medical evidence. The Board assigns substantially greater probative weight to the contemporaneous medical evidence, to include the April 2019 and December 2023 VA examinations, which revealed blood pressure readings recorded by medical professionals. Less probative weight is assigned to the Veteran's subjective assertions that service-connected hypertension was worse than contemplated by the noncompensable percent rating assigned.

The Veteran contends that he satisfies the criteria for a compensable rating because he is prescribed two medications to control his blood pressure and even on medications, the "bottom number" (diastolic pressure) is "sometimes over 100." As stated above, the rating criteria contemplate assigning a rating based on the ameliorative effects of medication. McCarroll, 28 Vet. App. at 267, 272. Furthermore, as demonstrated above, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's diastolic pressure was predominantly 100 or more; or that his systolic pressure was predominantly 160 or more during the appeal period. 

In this instance, the Board finds the evidence persuasively shows that the Veteran's blood pressure readings did not meet the rating criteria for a 10 percent evaluation or higher at any point during the appeal period, based on either current or historical blood pressure readings. Indeed, the evidence does not indicate that the Veteran had a diastolic pressure that was predominantly 100 or more; or that his systolic pressure was predominantly 160 or more at any time during the appeal period.

A higher disability evaluation is also not warranted as the evidence does not show diastolic pressure to predominantly 110 or higher or systolic pressure to predominantly 200 or higher to support a 20 percent rating, diastolic pressure to predominantly 120 or more to support a 40 percent rating, or diastolic pressure to predominantly 130 or more to support a 60 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. Rather, the evidence shows the Veteran has a history of elevated blood pressure that does not rise to the level of a compensable rating, despite the use of continuous medication.

Finally, neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with respect to his claim. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021). The Board, therefore, finds that an increased rating for the Veteran's hypertension is not warranted at this time and the appeal must be denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the Appeal Modernization Act, the Board shall remand to the AOJ to correct pre-decisional duty to assist error (including when the AOJ failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain VA treatment records or relevant federal or private treatment records, failed to obtain a VA examination, or provided an inadequate VA examination or opinion). 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Bilateral Hearing Loss and Tinnitus

The Veteran asserts entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. He reported that he suffered from ringing in the ears for years. See September 2023 Correspondence. Unfortunately, the Board finds that remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.

The January 2024 rating decision favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnoses of bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, and that he was exposed to hazardous noise exposure based on his MOS as Aircraft Structural Maintenance.

A November 2023 VA examiner opined negatively, stating that although the Veteran had an MOS with a high probability of hazardous noise exposure, review of the claims file revealed normal hearing bilaterally upon entrance and separation from military service. Additionally, the examiner found based on a 2005 Institute of Medicine (IOM) Report that there was no scientific basis to support delayed onset of military noise-related hearing loss. 

For tinnitus, the November 2023 examiner opined negatively, stating that the onset of tinnitus is reported by the Veteran to be post-separation. There is no report of tinnitus in service treatment records, at separation or in the medical records until the time of the claim. Additionally, the current literature does not support late onset noise-induced tinnitus. 

A January 2024 VA medical opinion was obtained in which, the examiner provided a negative opinion. The examiner stated that a nexus could not be established due to the fact the Veteran did not experience a permanent positive threshold shift during military service. Additionally, the examiner found that there is a lack of conclusive evidence or scientific research to support the theory that noise exposure can cause delayed onset hearing loss or accelerated hearing loss later in life. 

The November 2023 and January 2024 medical opinions are inadequate for adjudicating the claims of bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. In both instances, the examiners justified providing negative nexus opinions on a believed lack of evidence to find delayed onset hearing loss and lack of hearing loss at the time of separation. Service connection for a current hearing loss disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 is not precluded where the Veteran's hearing was found to be within normal limits on audiometric testing at separation from active military service. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). Even if disabling loss is not demonstrated at the time of separation, evidence of a current hearing loss disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 and a medically sound basis sufficient to attribute that disability to service (as opposed to after-service causes) may serve as a basis to grant entitlement to service connection for hearing loss. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993). The Board further notes that the Director of the VA Compensation and Pension Service observed in Training Letter 10-02, issued March 2010, that delayed-onset hearing loss be considered in the service-connection analysis. Additionally, the United States Court of Veterans Appeals (Court) has previously found that the IOM study has seemingly qualifying or contradictory statements. See McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243 (2019). 

The November 2023 VA examiner failed to address the qualifying or contradictory statements of the IOM report making the opinion inadequate. The November 2023 and January 2024 examiners further relied on the Veteran's normal hearing in service for their negative service connection opinion, which renders it inadequate for VA purposes. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993). For tinnitus, the November 2023 examiner relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, to provide a negative opinion. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (an examination was inadequate where the examiner did not comment on a Veteran's reports of in-service injury and instead relied on the absence of evidence in a Veteran's service treatment records to provide a negative opinion). As such, the opinions are inadequate. 

Failing to provide an adequate VA medical opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error. As such, the Board finds that a new VA medical opinion is necessary to adequate determine the etiology of the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. 

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

The Veteran generally asserts entitlement to a higher rating for the service-connected COPD. He reported that he now receives oxygen therapy at night with an oxygen concentrator for this condition. See September 2023 Correspondence.  Unfortunately, the Board finds that remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.

The Veteran was afforded two VA examination for respiratory conditions during the relevant appeal period. 

During the September 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported treatment including intermittent inhalational bronchodilator therapy and daily inhalational anti-inflammatory medication. The examiner reported the results of a December 2021 PFT which only included pre-bronchodilator results. The pre-bronchodilator results showed FVC to be 66 percent predicted, FEV-1 to be 56 percent predicted, and FEV-1/FVC to 63 percent. The examiner indicated that FEV-1/FVC testing result most accurately reflected the Veteran's level of disability. Post-bronchodilator testing was not completed because testing was 'not indicated in Veteran's particular case" as testing was completed while using medication. 

At the December 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported treatment including daily inhalational bronchodilator therapy and daily inhalational anti-inflammatory medication. He also required outpatient oxygen therapy. The examiner reported the results of a January 2023 PFT which only included pre-bronchodilator results. The pre-bronchodilator results showed FVC to be 66 percent predicted, FEV-1 to be 56 percent predicted, and FEV-1/FVC to 63 percent. The examiner indicated that FEV-1/FVC testing result most accurately reflected the Veteran's level of disability. Post-bronchodilator testing was not completed because the results were "not included in PFT results." Additionally, exercise capacity testing was not performed.  

The September 2022 and December 2023 VA examinations, and included PFTs, are inadequate for adjudication. 

Post-bronchodilator results are required when PFTs are done for disability evaluation purposes except when the results of pre-bronchodilator pulmonary function tests are normal or when the examiner determines that post-bronchodilator studies should not be done and states why. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(4). In applying the rating criteria, post-bronchodilator results are to be used unless the post-bronchodilator results were poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results, in which case the pre-bronchodilator values should be used for rating purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(5).

Here, the September 2022 and December 2023 VA examiners did not indicate that pre-bronchodilator pulmonary functions tests are normal, and did not determine that post-bronchodilator studies should not be done. As such, the examinations are inadequate. 

Additionally, the Board finds that the December 2023 is inadequate as it did not perform exercise capacity testing, despite the Veteran's use of outpatient oxygen therapy, and the examiner did not provide an explanation as to why. 

Failing to provide an adequate VA examination constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error. As such, the Board finds that a new VA examination is necessary to adequate determine the severity of the Veteran's COPD. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. The entire claims file must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner, including a copy of this REMAND order.

Following a complete review of the claims file, the examiner must respond to the following: 

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (i.e., the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, to include acoustic trauma sustained during active service? Why or why not?

(b.) Is it at least as likely as not (i.e., the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's tinnitus is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, to include acoustic trauma sustained during active service? Why or why not?

In rendering these opinions, the examiner must discuss the Veteran's lay statements as to the onset of each disability. 

The examiner is reminded that service connection for a current hearing loss disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 is not precluded where the Veteran's hearing was found to be within normal limits on audiometric testing at separation from active military service. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). 

Even if disabling loss is not demonstrated at the time of separation, evidence of a current hearing loss disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 and a medically sound basis sufficient to attribute that disability to service (as opposed to after-service causes) may serve as a basis to grant entitlement to service connection for hearing loss. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993).

Additionally, the examiner must consider delayed-onset hearing loss per the Director of the VA Compensation and Pension Service observed in Training Letter 10-02, issued March 2010, while considering the Court's finding that the 2005 IOM study has seemingly qualifying or contradictory statements. See McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243 (2019). 

A rationale should be provided for all opinions offered.

The medical opinion must support the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate to consider and weigh against other evidence of record; medical opinions must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. 

If an opinion cannot be expressed without resort to speculation, ensure that the clinician so indicates and discusses why an opinion is not possible, to include whether there is additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.

2. Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the current severity of his service-connected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The entire claims file must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner, including a copy of this REMAND order.

(a.) The examiner shall provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria. This should include performing pulmonary function testing, if necessary.

(b.) The Board notes that post-bronchodilator results are required when PFTs are done for disability evaluation purposes except when the results of pre-bronchodilator pulmonary function tests are normal or when the examiner determines that post-bronchodilator studies should not be done and states why. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(4). 

If post-bronchodilator results cannot be obtained, the examiner must explain why. 

(c.) Additionally, in consideration of the Veteran's required outpatient oxygen therapy, the examiner should perform exercise capacity testing, if necessary.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
