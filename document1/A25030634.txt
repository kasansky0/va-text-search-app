DOCKET NO. 210526-162329
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for total left knee replacement is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 13, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran, through his authorized representative, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty with the United States Army from January 1982 to August 1986; from February 2008 to April 2009; from August 2010 to September 2011; and from June 2014 to May 2015.  He had service in Afghanistan and Iraq and is a recipient of the Army Commendation Medal and the Combat Action Badge, among other decorations and awards.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals on appeal from a November 2020 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in this matter.

In November 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the November 2020 rating decision.  In March 2021, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior November 2020 decision. 

In the May 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  However, in March 2025, the Veteran, through his representative, submitted a written statement requesting to withdraw his request for a Board hearing, as well as his appeal.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  Here, the Veteran's withdrawal, submitted by his authorized representative, was in writing and included his name, applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
