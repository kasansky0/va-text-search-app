DOCKET NO. 241108-489879
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of September 20, 2022, for the grant of service connection for rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis secondary to diabetes mellitus type 2 is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for service-connected rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

On September 20, 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application seeking service connection for rheumatoid arthritis.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of September 20, 2022, for service connection for rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 1966 to September 1970. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to an increased evaluation for service-connected rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of such claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 13, 2023, for service connection for rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis.

The Veteran asserts entitlement to an effective date of September 20, 2022, for entitlement to service connection for rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis. See November 2024 VA Form 10182. Upon a review of the record, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of September 20, 2022, is warranted.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If a claim is received within one year following separation, the effective date of an award of compensation shall be the day following separation from service or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

An effective date of an award of service connection is not based on the earliest medical evidence showing a causal connection, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA. Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999). 

In the instant case, the Veteran filed a July 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ seeking service connection for rheumatoid arthritis. A February 2020 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection. In September 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application. A January 2023 rating decision denied service connection. The Veteran subsequently filed a January 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review. An April 2023 rating decision identified a duty to assist error and a November 2024 rating decision granted service connection for rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis with a 40 percent evaluation effective April 13, 2023. The Veteran subsequently submitted the November 2024 VA Form 10182 appealing the claim to the Board. 

Upon a review of the procedural history, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of September 20, 2022, for service connection for rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis is warranted.

As noted above, an effective date for the award of service connection is based upon the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA. Lalonde, 12 Vet. App. at 382. In the instant case, the February 2020 rating decision became final as the Veteran did not seek administrative review of the decision within one year of its issuance. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.203, 20.1103. Service connection was granted by the November 2024 rating decision pursuant to the September 2022 Supplemental Claim Application, which readjudicated the claim for entitlement to service connection for rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis. As the Board finds that September 20, 2022, is the receipt date of the claim for readjudication of entitlement to service connection for rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis, the Board finds that September 20, 2022, is the proper effective date for the grant of service connection for rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis.

Based upon the foregoing, the Board finds that an effective date of September 20, 2022, for service connection for rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis is warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for service-connected rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis.

The Veteran asserts entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for service-connected rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis. Upon a review of the record, the Board finds that a remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error and obtain an adequate VA examination to determine the nature of the Veteran's rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis. 

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran's representative referenced 38 C.F.R. § 4.71A, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5002, Note 3. Note 3 states that the ratings for the active process will not be combined with the residual ratings for limitation of motion or, ankylosis, or DC 5003, and instead, the higher evaluation is to be assigned. The Veteran's representative further argues that the VA examinations of record provide that the Veteran's symptomatology may have spread to other parts of the Veteran's body, hands, feet, and toes, and VA may have underrated the disability per Note 3. 

Turning to the evidence of record, the October 2022 VA examination found that the Veteran had joint involvement (e.g., pain, limitation of motion, joint deformity) attributable to his arthritis condition. The VA examiner further indicated that the affected joints included the bilateral hand/fingers and foot/toes. The Veteran reported "stiffness" in his bilateral hands and bilateral toe joints as well as achiness due to the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. He reported active treatment with many different medications for at least 10 years and noted that his active treatment has prevented the deformities of his joints that are often found with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. The Veteran further noted that his right- and left-hand symptoms are aggravated by "working" on his clocks in his clock business and that, when working, his pain in his bilateral hands can be an 8 or 9 out of 10 in terms of intensity. His bilateral hand symptoms improve when he stops working or when he takes a rest. The Veteran also reported aching in his bilateral feet secondary to his rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis.  The "aching" in his feet can be about 7 or 8 out of 10 in terms of intensity. His bilateral feet symptoms are aggravated by walking and improved by sitting down.

However, the July 2023 VA examination found that the Veteran did not have any joint involvement (e.g., pain, limitation of motion, joint deformity) attributable to his arthritis condition). 

The Board finds the evidence of record, and more specifically the October 2022 and July 2023 VA examinations, to be contradictory. The October 2022 VA examination found joint involvement attributable to the Veteran's arthritis condition, while the July 2023 VA examination did not. Further, the July 2023 VA examiner failed to address the Veteran's reports of joint involvement from October 2022. The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report lay-observable symptoms such as pain and stiffness in the bilateral hands and toe joints and the time of its onset and, thus, such should be considered by the VA examiner. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470. Therefore, another VA examination is necessary to resolve the inconsistencies regarding joint involvement related to the Veteran's arthritis condition. 

Further, in order to properly consider the Veteran's contentions and a rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71A, DC 5002, Note 3, additional information is needed to determine the nature and severity of joint involvement related to the Veteran's arthritis condition, if any. For example, during the October 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported "stiffness" in his bilateral hands and bilateral toe joints. Such stiffness may result in limitation of motion and a potential rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71A, DC 5002, Note 3. Therefore, the Board finds that a remand is necessary to further develop the Veteran's claim by obtaining an adequate VA examination.

Based upon the foregoing, a remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error and obtain an adequate VA examination to determine the nature of service-connected rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of service-connected rheumatoid and multi-joint arthritis. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.  

More specifically, the examiner must determine whether there is joint involvement (e.g., pain, limitation of motion, joint deformity) attributable to the Veteran's arthritis condition. Should the examiner find joint involvement, the examiner must describe the joint involvement in terms of pain, functional loss, joint deformity, and/or limitation of motion for rating purposes. 

A complete rationale must be provided for all opinions given.
