DOCKET NO. 240529-443853
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis with intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, lumbar degenerative arthritis is at least as likely as not related to May 2013 injury during active-duty service.

2. The competent and probative evidence of record weighs in favor of a finding that the Veteran's bilateral radiculopathy disability is caused by his now service-connected back disability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for lumbar degenerative arthritis with IVDS are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy disability as secondary to service-connected back disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2012 to July 2013. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

1. Entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis with IVDS

2. Entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy

3. Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy

The Veteran seeks service connection for a low back disability and associated lumbar radiculopathy.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service treatment records reflect treatment for low back pain. In May 2013, the Veteran presented for back pain, which the Veteran reported had started following a car accident in December 2010. In a June 2013 note, the Veteran reported back pain that had worsened in May 2013 during physical training (PT). 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2022. The Veteran reported that he had injured his back in a motor vehicle accident on his way to work, and reinjured his back in 2013 while in service. He reported that his back pain had worsened since service. The examiner diagnosed degenerative arthritis. The examiner opined that the Veteran's back disability was at least as likely as not incurred or caused by the claimed injury. The examiner explained that the Veteran had injured his back while in-service, and reinjured his back while in service in 2013. The examiner noted that the Veteran had progressively worsened since 2013, with increased pain. While degenerative arthritis of the spine can occur as part of the aging process, trauma, such as a car accident, can also cause it. The examiner found that chronicity and a nexus had been established. 

In April 2023, a VA examiner opined that there was clear and unmistakable evidence of the preexisting degenerative arthritis of the spine and intervertebral disc syndrome. The examiner explained that there was evidence that the Veteran continued to suffer from a back disability during service. However, the examiner determined that the progression was not beyond normal progression for this disorder.  No evidence of permanent aggravation beyond normal progression was identified.

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that is related to May 2013 injury during active-duty physical training. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

The evidence against the claim includes April 2023 VA addendum opinion. The examiner opined that the Veteran's degenerative arthritis clearly and unmistakably preexisted his active-duty service, based upon the 2010 motor vehicle accident. Further, the examiner found that while the Veteran had suffered from his back disability during service, it had not worsened beyond its normal progression.

The evidence in favor of the claim includes November 2022 VA examination and opinion. The examiner noted both the 2010 motor vehicle accident injury and the 2013 PT injury. The examiner opined that the Veteran's low back disability was at least as likely as not related to the Veteran's injury during active service. The examiner explained that injuries, like the PT and motor vehicle accident, could cause or worsen lumbar spine degenerative arthritis.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's current degenerative arthritis is related to service. Accordingly, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine is warranted.

Regarding the Veteran's bilateral radiculopathy, the April 2023 VA addendum opined that the Veteran's radiculopathy is at least as likely as not related to low back disability. The Board finds that the competent and probative evidence of record persuasively shows that the Veteran's bilateral radiculopathy disability arises from his now service-connected back disability. As such, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral radiculopathy disability is granted as secondary to the Veteran's now service-connected back disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Allen, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448. 

In sum, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for degenerative arthritis and associated lumbar radiculopathies is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
