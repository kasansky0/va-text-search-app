ORDER

Service connection for headaches is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Headaches are not shown to be causally or etiologically related to any disease, injury, or incident during service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation from active duty.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for headaches have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2005 to June 2006.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to a March 2023 higher-level review request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service connection for headaches.

The Veteran contends her headaches are due to or had their onset in service.  See January 2022 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Where a Veteran served for at least 90 days during a period of war or after December 31, 1946, and manifests certain chronic diseases, such as psychoses, to a degree of 10 percent within one year, from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  

When a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  However, the use of continuity of symptoms to establish service connection is limited only to those diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) and does not apply to other disabilities which might be considered chronic from a medical standpoint.  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Every Veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.  38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).  Therefore, where there is evidence showing that a disorder manifested or was incurred in service, and this disorder is not noted on the Veteran's entrance examination report, this presumption of soundness operates to shield the Veteran from any finding that the unnoted disease or injury pre-existed service.  See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48 (2012); Bagby v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 225, 227 (1991); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).

Such presumption is only rebutted where the evidence clearly and unmistakably shows that the Veteran's disability (1) existed before acceptance and enrollment into service and (2) was not aggravated by service.  See Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Bagby, 1 Vet. App. at 227; VAOPGCPREC 3-2003 (July 16, 2003).  The two parts of this rebuttal standard are referred to as the "preexistence prong" and the "aggravation prong."  Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 234 (2012).  To satisfy this second-prong requirement for rebutting the presumption of soundness, the government must show by clear and unmistakable evidence either that there was no increase in disability during service or that any increase in disability was "due to the natural progression" of the condition.  Joyce v. Nicholson, 443 F.3d 845, 847 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

It is the policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent with the facts in each case with all reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the claimant; however, the reasonable doubt rule is not a means for reconciling actual conflict or a contradiction in the evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in "approximate" balance (i.e., "nearly equal)" but does not require that the evidence be in exact equipoise.  Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391, 1394 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In the Veteran's July 2005 enlistment report of medical examination, the examiner noted normal head, face, neck, and scalp, as well as a normal neurologic system.  Service treatment records show in December 2005 the Veteran would get headaches if she did not wear her personal glasses.  The Veteran presented to the clinic in February 2006 for pelvic pain, complaining of headaches as well, and was diagnosed with an acute urinary tract infection.  Also in February 2006, a review of her history showed no headaches.

In a February 2006 medical board report of medical history, the Veteran indicated "no" to frequent or severe headaches, as well as head injury, memory loss, or amnesia.  The accompanying February 2006 report of medical history noted normal head, face, neck, and scalp, as well as normal neurologic system.

In March 2006 she presented for dry heaves, along with additional symptoms of headache, cough, chest pain, and chills; she was diagnosed with a viral syndrome.  She denied headaches again in May 2006.  In May 2006, the Veteran was given an uncharacterized discharge for a pre-existing medical condition, specifically major depressive disorder (MDD).  See October 2006 STR - Medical (2x); March 2008 Military Personnel Record; October 2016 Military Personnel Record; March 2017 STR.

During an April 2008 VA examination for her low back, the Veteran stated she had a history of migraine headaches.  No further information or discussion was provided.  See April 2008 VA Examination.

Post-service treatment records show the Veteran was seen for her mental health in March 2017.  It was noted that the Veteran took Excedrin almost every other day for migraines; Excedrin usage was reconfirmed in May 2017.  In October 2019 she denied headaches.  An October 2019 active problem list included anxiety and depression, but did not indicate headaches or migraines.  See January 2020 and January 2022 CAPRI.

Upon review, the Board finds that service connection for headaches is not warranted.  Initially, the Veteran's medical records do not include an active diagnosis of headaches nor are headaches listed in active problems lists.  However, the Board recognizes that headache pain is subjective, and the Veteran as a lay person is competent to testify to observable symptoms of disability such as headaches and migraines.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Therefore, the first prong of Shedden has been established.  However, the Board finds that there has been no in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, the second requirement for service connection.

The evidence does not show that the Veteran was diagnosed with headaches or migraines during service.  In this regard, the Board notes that she twice reported headaches in conjunction with other medical issues in February 2006 and March 2006, where she was diagnosed with an acute urinary tract infection and viral syndrome, respectively.  She also stated that she would get headaches if she did not wear her personal glasses. But no chronic headaches were noted.

However, the rest of her service treatment records are absent any complaints of headaches.  Furthermore, she specifically indicated "no" to frequent or severe headaches, as well as head injury, memory loss, or amnesia on her medical board February 2006 report of medical history.  Additionally, her May 2006 discharge was based on her pre-existing MDD, but headaches were not listed in conjunction with her MDD.

Post-service treatment records are also absent any reports of headaches until her April 2008 VA examination for her low back, in which she stated she had a history of migraines.  The Board notes that the April 2008 report of a history of migraines was approximately two years after she left active duty in June 2006.  Therefore, the Board does not find her headaches have been shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).

Following the April 2008 report of a history of migraines, the next reported occurrence of migraines was in March 2017 where the Veteran reported she took Excedrin almost every other day for migraines.  However, no further complaints of or treatment for headaches or migraines were made until her January 2022 claim for service-connection.  As such, the Board also finds that continuity of symptomatology after service has not been established under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

The Board further notes that the Veteran's July 2005 enlistment and her February 2006 medical board reports of medical examination indicated normal head, face, neck, and scalp, as well as a normal neurologic system; nothing regarding migraines or headaches were indicated in the reports.  As the Veteran's entrance examination did not indicate issues with headaches or migraines upon enlistment, she was presumed sound upon entry into service, and in her February 2006 report of medical examination, no headaches were noted.  These reports regarding the lack of headaches prior to and during service outweigh the Veteran's April 2008 VA examination statements that she had a history of migraines.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b); AZ v. Shinseki, 731 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Moreover, none of the VA examinations of record for her other claims or service-connected disabilities indicate that the Veteran reported that her headaches were caused or aggravated by her service-connected disabilities.

Finally, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination for her headaches and that a VA opinion was not obtained.  VA's duty to assist includes providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion if certain requirements are met.  In this regard, VA must provide a VA medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for [VA] to make a decision on the claim.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006) (with citations made to 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)).

In this case, the Board finds that no VA examination or opinion is required because there is no evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies.  As such, the Board finds that the requirements for a VA examination or opinion were not met in this case.

Thus, as the second prong of Shedden has not been found, the third prong is not applicable, as all three elements of Shedden are required for service connection.

Accordingly, although the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt where the evidence is in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable where, as here, the weight of the evidence is against the claim for entitlement to service connection for headaches.  The claim is denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 999 F.3d at 1394.
