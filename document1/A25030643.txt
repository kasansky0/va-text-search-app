ORDER

Entitlement to revision of the January 1993 rating decision assigning a single combined 10 percent rating for bilateral shoulder, cervical spine, and left elbow disorders on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The statutory and regulatory provisions extant at the time of the January 1993 rating decision were correctly applied, and the AOJ did not commit a CUE of which reasonable minds could not differ.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to revision of a January 1993 rating decision assigning a single combined 10 percent rating for bilateral shoulder, cervical spine, and left elbow disorders on the basis of CUE have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5109A; 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1959 to May 1961, and from August 1966 to September 1991.  The matter is on appeal under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) from a rating decision issued in June 2023.  In the June 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

In a November 2023 decision, the Board denied the claim on appeal, which the Veteran appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In an October 2024 order, the Court vacated the decision, for reasons explained below, and remanded the matter back to the Board for further proceedings consistent with a Joint Motion for Remand (JMPR).    

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

CUE

A previous Regional Office determination that is final and binding will be accepted as correct in the absence of CUE.  Where evidence establishes such error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).  Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of CUE.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105.  CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error."  It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.  Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE.  Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error."  Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993).  In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different.  Id. at 44.

Where evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or amended.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).  For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision.  Id. 

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated"; and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time that decision was rendered.  Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992).

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision.  See Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233, 235-36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset.  King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014).  The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different.  Id. at 442.

The benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application in claims of CUE.  Andrews v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 177, 186 (2004) (citing Russell, 3 Vet. App. at 313) (it is well established that the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine can never be applicable in assessing a CUE motion because the nature of such a motion is that it involves more than a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated).

In a January 1993 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for osteoarthritis of both shoulders, cervical spine, and left elbow, x-ray evidence only.  The rating decision noted that on examination, the Veteran moved about easily and well without obvious difficulty or limitation, and there was full mobility of the cervical spine in all directions.  While there was full range of motion in the elbows, extremes of movement were painful on forward and lateral elevations.  A 10 percent rating was assigned pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5003 effective October 5, 1992.  The Veteran was notified of this decision in a correspondence dated in February 1993.  While he filed a notice of disagreement as to a denial of the left elbow condition in May 1993, the June 1993 statement of the case noted that the Veteran was granted service connection for a left elbow condition which was combined in the January 1993 rating decision.  While the AOJ issued a rating decision in December 1993 that found that there was no basis for a separate rating for left elbow arthritis, the Veteran has not challenged this rating decision based on CUE.  The Veteran did not appeal the January 1993 rating decision, and no new and material evidence was filed within one year of the January 1993 rating decision.  Thus, the January 1993 rating decision became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.160(d), 3.156(b), 20.302, 20.1103.

The Veteran is seeking revision on the basis of CUE of the January 1993 rating decision that assigned a single combined 10 percent rating for bilateral shoulder, cervical spine, and left elbow disorders.  In his December 2022 CUE motion, the Veteran contended that the AOJ misapplied the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.71a and 4.59, in combining the disabilities under a single 10 percent rating.  The AOJ committed CUE when it failed to evaluate each disability individually under the respective diagnostic codes for the pain in each joint.  The Veteran was entitled to the minimum compensable rating for each joint due to painful motion pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, which was 10 percent for the neck, 10 percent for the elbow, and 20 percent for each shoulder.  In a September 2023 argument, the Veteran's representative cited to Lichtenfels v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 484 (1991), which found "even if the claimant technically has full range of motion but the motion is inhibited by pain, a compensable rating for arthritis under Diagnostic Code 5003 and section 4.59 would be available."  Merriam-Webster dictionary defines "inhibited" as "to prohibit from doing something."  

As a threshold matter, the Board finds that the arguments advanced by the Veteran allege CUE with the requisite specificity.  See Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003).  The Board will therefore adjudicate the merits of his claim.

At the time of the January 1993 rating decision, 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003 evaluated degenerative arthritis, hypertrophic and osteoarthritis.  Degenerative arthritis established by x-ray findings was rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved.  When however, the limitation of motion of the specific joint or joints involved is noncompensable under the appropriate diagnostic codes, a rating of 10 percent is for application for each such major joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion, to be combined, not added under Diagnostic Code 5003.  Limitation of motion must be objectively confirmed by findings such as swelling, muscle spasm, or satisfactory evidence of painful motion.  In the absence of limitation of motion, arthritis is rated as follows: a 10 percent rating would be warranted for x-ray evidence of involvement of 2 or more major joints or 2 or more minor joint groups.  A 20 percent rating would be warranted for x-ray evidence of involvement of 2 or more major joints or 2 or more minor joint groups, with occasional incapacitating exacerbations.  See 38 C.F.R. 4.71a (1993).

38 C.F.R. § 4.45(f) stated, that for the purpose of rating disability from arthritis, the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle are considered major joints; multiple involvements of the interphalangeal, metacarpal and carpal joints of the upper extremities, the interphalangeal, metatarsal and tarsal joints of the lower extremities, the cervical vertebrae, the dorsal vertebrae, and the lumbar vertebrae, are considered groups of minor joints, ratable on a parity with major joints.  The lumbosacral articulation and both sacroiliac joints are considered to be a group of minor joints, ratable on disturbance of lumbar spine functions.

Pertaining to the shoulders, limitation of motion was evaluated by limitation of motion of the arm (Diagnostic Code 5201).  Limitation of motion of the neck was evaluated by limitation of motion of the cervical spine (Diagnostic Code 5290).  Limitation of motion of the elbow was evaluated by limitation of flexion (Diagnostic Code 5206), limitation of extension (diagnostic Code 5207), and limitation of supination and pronation (Diagnostic Code 5213).  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

In 1993 as now, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 discussed painful motion.  This regulation provided that actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, were entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for a joint. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in November 1992.  The examination report noted that he had a history of pain.  He was noted to be well-developed and who moved about easily and well without obvious difficulty or limitation.  His standing posture was good with level pelvis.  There was full mobility of the cervical spine in all directions but there is some pain on forced flexion and forced extension of the head.  Although there was full range of motion of both elbows with normal muscular development extremes of movement, particularly forward and lateral elevations are painful within the shoulder joints.  He was diagnosed with multiple arthralgias and history of strain injury of the left elbow with persistent pain.  Following November 1992 X-rays, it revealed that the Veteran had osteoarthritis of the cervical spine, osteoarthritic changes in the bilateral shoulders, and very early osteoarthritic changes in the left elbow.   

The November 2023 Board decision denied the claim for revision of the January 1992 rating decision based on CUE was based on the factual finding that the Veteran demonstrated no perceptible limitation of motion at that time.  For separate ratings to have been warranted, there must have been a showing that there was at least some limitation of motion, albeit to a noncompensable level.  The October 2024 JMR noted that the Board misapplied the law, and that the Lichtenfels decision found that painful motion of a major joint or group of joints caused by degenerative arthritis, where the arthritis is established by x-ray, is deemed to be limited motion and entitled to a minimum 10 percent rating per joint, even though there is no actual limitation of motion.

In Lichtenfels v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 484, 488 (1991), the Court held that read together, Diagnostic Code 5003 and 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 indicate that painful motion of a major joint or groups caused by degenerative arthritis, where the arthritis is established by X-ray, is deemed to be limited motion and entitled to a minimum 10 percent rating, per joint, combined under Diagnostic Code 5003, even though there is no actual limitation of motion.     

As indicated, in the January 1993 rating decision, the AOJ assigned an initial 10 percent rating for osteoarthritis of both shoulders, cervical spine, and left elbow, based on x-ray evidence only.  However, to rate arthritis of a specific joint separately, limitation of motion had to be present.  See Diagnostic Code 5003.  As evidenced by the VA examination findings at the time, while there was some pain shown only on extremes of movement, there was no demonstrated limitation of motion in the shoulders, cervical spine, and left elbow.  There was also no evidence of swelling or muscle spasm.  In addition, the examiner noted the Veteran to be well-developed and who moved about easily and well without obvious difficulty or limitation.  It could be argued that the AOJ assigned the combined 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5003 due to the examination's findings that the Veteran had pain, but it did not inhibit or cause loss of motion.  Therefore, it cannot be found that it was undebatable that separate minimal compensable ratings for the bilateral shoulders, cervical spine, and left elbow would have been warranted at the time.  Any disagreement of how the evidence was weighed and evaluated cannot amount to CUE.  Fugo, 6 Vet. App. at 43-44.  Accordingly, there was no CUE in the January 1993 rating decision as reasonable minds could differ at the time as to whether a combined 10 percent rating was warranted for osteoarthritis of both shoulders, cervical spine, and left elbow.        

Also, it was not until December 1995 that the Court, in DeLuca v. Brown, found that VA's method of assessing joint disabilities for rating purposes was inadequate, as VA examinations did not account for additional limitation of function due to pain on movement, weakness, excess fatigability, or incoordination, including during repetitive use or during flare-ups.  8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  Because the holding in DeLuca was not in effect at the time of the January 1993 rating decision, any attack on the adequacy of the November 1992 examination report based on DeLuca is not persuasive.

Consequently, while there was evidence of pain in the both shoulders, the cervical spine, and left elbow, there was no definitive and unrefuted evidence, in conjunction with the rating criteria, that would warrant a separate rating for the shoulders, cervical spine, and left elbow arthritis based on limitation of motion.  As such, the Board finds that the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were correctly applied.  The AOJ's determination that a 10 percent combined rating was warranted for the x-ray presence of osteoarthritis of both shoulders, cervical spine, and left elbow was a reasonable application of the statutory provisions at the time.  Swritzer v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 503, 504-5 (1993) ("As in all questions involving statutory interpretation, our analysis begins with an examination of the language of the statute itself.").

Altogether, the January 1993 rating decision considered the available facts, applied reasonable weighing of evidence, and applied reasonable interpretations of the correct law at the time for the assignment a single combined 10 percent rating for both shoulders, cervical spine, and left elbow disorders.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).  The motion for CUE is denied.
