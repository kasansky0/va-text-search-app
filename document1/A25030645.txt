ORDER

A disability rating greater than 70 percent for service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with major depressive disorder (hereinafter "PTSD") is denied.

A disability rating greater than 20 percent for service-connected left shoulder rotator cuff tear with surgical repair (hereinafter "left shoulder disability") is denied.

A disability rating of 20 percent for service-connected left ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain with osteoarthritis (hereinafter "left ankle disability"), for the period on appeal, is granted.

A disability rating greater than 10 percent for service-connected dermatitis is denied.

A disability rating of 10 percent for service-connected right great toe scar, for the period on appeal, is granted.

An effective date prior to May 22, 2019 for entitlement to basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At no point during the period on appeal did the Veteran's service-connected PTSD cause total occupational and social impairment.

2. At no point during the period on appeal did the Veteran's service-connected left shoulder disability manifest as flexion and/or abduction limited to 25 degrees from the side.

3. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his left ankle disability manifested as marked limitation of motion for the period on appeal due to severe ankle pain.

4. At no point during the period on appeal did the Veteran's service-connected dermatitis manifest as characteristic lesions involving at least 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.

5. The Veteran's right great toe scar is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, and covers an area of less than 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.), but is painful.

6. The Veteran does not have a permanent total service-connected disability prior to May 22, 2019.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1976 to July 1996. 

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from August 2022 and September 2022 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decisions. After receiving notice of the August 2022 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review that same month seeking entitlement to earlier effective dates for the assignment of an increased disability rating for PTSD, and for entitlement to basic eligibility to DEA. The RO readjudicated each issue within the Higher-Level Review process, then issued the September 2022 rating decision.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement (NOD) which was received in July 2023, and selected the Direct Review docket. In the direct review docket, the Board reviews the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decision for each issue. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. In this case, the Board is thereby limited to review of the evidence received by the time of the August 2022 rating decision; in other words, any evidence submitted after the rating decision on appeal was not considered by the Board in the instant decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's inclusion of an appeal for entitlement to a TDIU within the July 2023 VA Form 10182. However, that issue was previously docketed to the Board following receipt of the July 2021 VA Form 10182 in which the Veteran identified, inter alia, a claim of entitlement to a TDIU and elected the Evidence Submission Review Lane. Accordingly, that issue is not addressed within this decision.

INCREASED RATINGS 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of a service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  

Staged ratings must be considered, which are appropriate when the evidence establishes that the claimed disability manifested symptoms that would warrant different ratings for distinct time periods during the appeal.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).  See also Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999) (applying this concept to initial ratings).

When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the effective date of an increase may date back as much as one year before the date of the claim for increase if it is factually "ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred" within that timeframe. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997) (stating that § 3.400 (o)(2) applies to claim where increase in disability precedes claim, providing that that claim is received within one year after increase, otherwise general rule in § 3.400 (o)(1) applies). Nevertheless, the effective date for an increased disability rating, initial rating, or staged rating is predicated on when the increase in the level of disability can be ascertained. Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015).

1. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for service-connected PTSD

The Veteran seeks an increased disability rating for service-connected PTSD, which is rated as 70 percent disabling for the period on appeal under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 30 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, and mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events). Id. 

A 50 percent rating is assigned when there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; in difficulty establishing effective work and social relationships. Id.

A 70 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relationships, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id. 

A 100 percent rating is warranted when there is evidence of total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time and place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or name. Id.

Symptoms listed in the General Rating Formula serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating. They are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442-44 (2002). Rather, the rating assigned must be based on a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. A veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under § 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114 (Fed. Cir. 2013). However, the presence or lack of evidence of a specific sign or symptom listed in the evaluation criteria is not necessarily dispositive of any particular disability level. Bankhead, 29 Vet. App. at 25.

The record contains, in pertinent part, private and VA treatment records, as well as VA examination findings. 

Particularly relevant are the VA examination reports, which reflect in-person findings directly addressing the severity of the Veteran's PTSD. 

The Veteran had VA PTSD examinations in June 2019, November 2019, and April 2022. Each examiner obtained relevant information from the Veteran concerning social, family and marital history, occupational and educational history, and allowed the Veteran to describe the in-service stressors to which he attributed his acquired psychiatric disorder. The examiners identified applicable criteria for establishing the current PTSD diagnosis, and identified symptoms caused by the PTSD. Each examiner provided behavioral observations, which generally indicated that the Veteran behaved and dressed appropriately, and communicated effectively while exhibiting adequate insight and judgment.

With the above information, and after thorough review of the Veteran's claims file, each examiner concluded that the Veteran's PTSD caused occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, but did not cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas or total occupational and social impairment.

Such findings are consistent with the remainder of the medical records, which show that the Veteran consistently denied any current or history of suicidal ideation or attempts. Moreover, the Veteran maintains familial and social relationships and communicates effectively with his many healthcare providers.

With the above in mind, the analysis turns to whether the criteria are met such that assignment of a higher rating for PTSD-i.e. 100 percent-is warranted. The probative evidence weighs persuasively against such a finding. Specifically, the VA examination findings reflect a lesser degree of severity than total occupational and social impairment, and such findings are consistent with the remainder of the evidence of record.  Though the General Rating Formula is not an exhaustive list, a review of the General Rating Formula suggests that the severity of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms more closely approximates the criteria corresponding to assignment no greater than a 70 percent. See generally Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442-44.

As so, the criteria for assignment of a disability rating greater than 70 percent for service-connected PTSD are not met. There is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor, and the claim is denied. 

2. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for service-connected left shoulder rotator cuff tear with surgical repair

The Veteran seeks an increased disability rating for his service-connected left shoulder disability, which is rated as 20 percent disabling for the period on appeal under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5201.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA revised the criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disorders. See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76464 (Nov. 30, 2020); Correction, 86 Fed. Reg. 8142, 8143 (Feb. 4, 2021) (changing new diagnostic code applicable to plantar fasciitis from 5285 to 5269).  

VA's General Counsel has held that where a law or regulation changes during the pendency of a claim for a higher rating, the Board must first determine whether the revised version is more favorable to the veteran.  In so doing, it may be necessary for the Board to apply both the old and new versions of the regulation.  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the retroactive reach of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  The Board must generally apply both the former and the revised versions of the regulation for the period prior and subsequent to the regulatory change, but an effective date based on the revised criteria may be no earlier than the date of the change.  

VA thus must consider the claim for a higher rating pursuant to the former and revised regulations during the latter part of this appeal.  See VAOPGCPREC 3 2000, 65 Fed. Reg. 33,422 (2000); DeSousa v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 461, 467 (1997).  Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claim under the old criteria prior to February 7, 2021 and both the old and new rating criteria from February 7, 2021. The criteria that is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied.

Under the prior regulations, Diagnostic Code 5201 provides compensation for limitation of arm motion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Limitation of motion of the arm at the shoulder level is rated 20 percent for the major shoulder and 20 percent for the minor shoulder.  Id.  Limitation of motion of the arm midway between the side and shoulder level is rated as 30 percent for the major shoulder and 20 percent for the minor shoulder.  Id.  Limitation of motion of the arm to 25 degrees from the side is rated as 40 percent for the major shoulder and 30 percent for the minor shoulder.  Id.

Effective February 7, 2021, under Diagnostic Code 5201, limitation of motion of the arm at the shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 90°) is rated 20 percent for the major shoulder and 20 percent for the minor shoulder.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Limitation of motion of the arm midway between the side and shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 45°) is rated as 30 percent for the major shoulder and 20 percent for the minor shoulder.  Id.  Flexion and/or abduction limited to 25° from side is rated as 40 percent for the major shoulder and 30 percent for the minor shoulder.  Id.

As the Veteran's left shoulder is his non-dominant shoulder, minor shoulder ratings apply.

The Veteran had a VA examination in August 2019. He reported flare-ups when lifting, especially overhead, 2-3 times per week. Flexion was to 140 degrees with abduction to 110 (decreased to 105 degrees after repeated use). Pain occurred during flexion, abduction, and internal rotation, but did not cause or result in functional loss. Pain during flare-ups was noted to limit functional ability, restricting abduction to 105 degrees while flexion was still to 140 degrees. Muscle strength was normal. The Veteran was still able to perform manual labor, but could not lift greater than 20 lbs.

The Veteran had another VA examination in October 2019. He reported flare-ups every day which were moderate and precipitated by lifting, sudden movement, pushing, or pulling. The examiner was unable to perform range of motion testing due to severe guarding.

The Veteran had another VA examination in November 2019. He reported flare-ups every day which were moderate and precipitated by carrying heavy objects. Flexion and abduction were to 90 degrees, and range of motion did not contribute to a functional loss. Pain was noted on examination but did not cause functional loss. Repeated use over time testing resulted in flexion and abduction limited to 80 degrees. Though the examination was not conducted during flare-up, the examiner was able to estimate that flare-ups would cause limitation of flexion and abduction to 80 degrees. Muscle strength was normal with no evidence of atrophy. Rotator cuff testing indicated rotator cuff and infraspinatus pathology. The examiner noted objective evidence of pain on passive range of motion and during non-weight bearing.

The Veteran had another VA examination January 2020. Flexion was to 120 degrees and abduction to 70 degrees. External rotation was to 30 degrees and internal to 60 degrees (out of 90). Pain was noted with all ranges of motion. Repeated use and repetitive use over time caused a decrease in abduction range of motion to 60 degrees. Muscle strength was normal. As the Veteran did not report flare-ups, the examiner did not provide range of motion findings during flare-up.

The Veteran had another VA examination in April 2022. The Veteran described functional loss as "trouble lifting left arm above shoulder level or overhead." Flexion was to 70 degrees and abduction to 60 degrees, and internal and external rotation to 40 and 20 degrees respectively, with pain noted during each range of motion. Passive range of motion and active range of motion findings were the same. Repeated use over time was estimated to reduce flexion to 65 degrees and abduction to 55 degrees. Flare-ups were estimated to reduce flexion to 60 degrees and abduction to 50 degrees. There was no evidence of atrophy or ankylosis. The Veteran was unable to test for rotator cuff conditions due to severe pain.

With the above in mind, and upon review of the Veteran's claims file including medical and lay evidence, the analysis turns to whether an increased rating is warranted-whether under the "old" criteria, or the amended criteria.

Under the "old" criteria, the next higher rating of 30 percent is warranted when there is limitation of motion of the arm to 25 degrees from the side. The VA examination findings consistently show that the Veteran's left shoulder disability did not limit his range of motion to 25 degrees or less. Rather, flexion and abduction range of motion findings demonstrate left shoulder range of motion to a much greater degree and the Veteran's own reports indicate that pain and impairment generally began after lifting objects above shoulder level. As so, there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor as would warrant assignment of a higher rating under the "old criteria." To that extent, the claim is denied.

Under the amended criteria, a rating greater than 20 percent is only warranted for flexion and/or abduction limited to 25° from the side. As set out above, the evidence consistently shows that such a degree of impairment was not present at any time during the period on appeal. The examination evidence is particularly probative because the findings cover a span of several years, were offered after in-person examination, and are consistent with the remainder of the evidence in the claims file. As so, there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor as would warrant assignment of a higher rating under the amended criteria. To that extent, the claim is denied.

3. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for service-connected left ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain with osteoarthritis

The Veteran seeks an increased disability rating for his service-connected left ankle disability, which is rated as 10 percent disabling for the period on appeal under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5003-5271.

Prior to February 7, 2021, DC 5271 provides a 10 percent disability rating for moderate limitation of motion of the ankle and a 20 percent disability rating for marked limitation of motion of the ankle. The words "moderate" or "marked" are not defined in the VA Schedule prior to February 7, 2021. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions are equitable and just. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. It should also be noted that use of terminology such as "moderate" or "severe" by VA examiners and others, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue. All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Effective February 7, 2021, Diagnostic Code 5271 provides definitions for "moderate" and "marked" and a 10 percent disability rating for moderate limitation of motion of the ankle is defined as less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion. A 20 percent disability rating for marked limitation of motion of the ankle is defined as less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion.

Normal or full range of motion for the ankle is dorsiflexion (extension) from zero to 20 degrees and plantar flexion from zero to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II. 

Having reviewed the VA examination findings from July 2019, August 2019, October 2019, and April 2022, as well as the lay evidence, including the Veteran's reports from as early as January 2015, the Board finds it reasonable to conclude that his ankle pain was of such severity as to cause marked limitation of motion. The Veteran uses a cane, and frequently experiences pain that causes him to refrain from use. At times he has required X-ray testing to address severe left ankle pain. As such, his left ankle disability symptoms more closely approximate marked limitation of motion.

A 20 percent disability rating, which is the highest rating allowed under the applicable rating criteria, is granted for the period on appeal.

4. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for service-connected dermatitis

The Veteran seeks an increased disability rating for service-connected dermatitis, which is rated as 10 percent disabling for the period on appeal under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7806.

Diagnostic Code 7806 provides compensation for dermatitis or eczema.  38 U.S.C. § 4.118.  Effective August 13, 2018, dermatitis or eczema are evaluated under the General Rating Formula for the Skin.  Id.  

A 0 percent rating is provided for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: (i) characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or (ii) characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.  Id.  

A 10 percent rating is provided for at least one of the following: (i) characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; (ii) at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or (iii) intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  

A 30 percent rating is provided for at least one of the following: (i) characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or (ii) systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  

A 60 percent rating is provided for at least one of the following: (i) characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or (ii) constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  

Alternatively, dermatitis or eczema can be rated as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (Diagnostic Code 7800) or scars (Diagnostic Codes 7801, 7802, 7804, or 7805), depending upon the predominant disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118. 

"Systemic therapy" refers to treatment that is administered through any route (orally, injection, suppository, intranasally) other than the skin.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).  "Topical therapy" refers to treatment that is administered through the skin.  Id.  Two or more skin conditions may be combined in accordance with § 4.25 only if separate areas of the skin are involved.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118(b).  Only the highest evaluation shall be used if two or more skin conditions involve the same area of skin.  Id.  

Topical corticosteroids, such as skin creams, do not categorically constitute "systemic therapy" under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, but may constitute "systemic therapy" if administered on a large enough scale to affect the body as a whole.  Johnson v. Shulkin, 862 F.3d 1351, 1355-56 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  In other words, some topical treatments may constitute "systemic therapy," depending on the facts of the case.  Burton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 286, 291 (2018).  In addressing whether a topically-applied corticosteroid is a systemic therapy, the Board must consider two questions.  First, "whether a topical treatment operates by affecting the body as a whole in treating the veteran's skin condition."  Id. at 292 (emphasis omitted).  Second, "whether a given treatment is 'like' a corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive drug...."  Id. at 294.  Neither question categorically requires a medical opinion to be answered.  Burton only applies to claims filed prior to August 13, 2018.  

The Veteran had a VA examination in August 2019. The examiner noted that the Veteran was treated with topical corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications for six weeks or more, but not constant. He did not have any treatments or procedures within the prior twelve months for any other skin condition. The total body area and exposed body area covered by dermatitis was noted as "None." In other words, he had no visible characteristic lesions at the time of the examination.

The Veteran had another VA examination in October 2019. The examiner noted that the Veteran was treated with topical corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications for six weeks or more, but not constant or near-constant. The Veteran did not have any treatment or procedure other than systemic or topical medications in the past 12 months for any skin condition. Total body area and exposed area affected by the dermatitis were each between 5 percent and 20 percent.

The Veteran had another VA examination in April 2022. The examiner again noted that the Veteran was treated with topical corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications for six weeks or more, but not constant or near-constant. The Veteran did not have any treatment or procedure other than systemic or topical medications in the past 12 months for any skin condition. The total body area and exposed body area covered by dermatitis was noted as "None."

Upon review of the Veteran's claims file, and with the above in mind, the probative evidence weighs persuasively in favor of finding that the criteria for assignment of a disability rating greater than 10 percent for dermatitis, are not met at any time during the period on appeal. VA examination findings show that the total area and exposed area affected by dermatitis was not greater than between 5 and 20 percent, and the Veteran has only treated the condition topically-he has not required systemic therapy such as orally, by injection, suppository, or intranasally. As so, the criteria for assignment of a disability rating greater than 10 percent are not met at any time during the period on appeal. There is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor, and the claim is denied. 

5. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for service-connected right great toe scar

The Veteran seeks an increased disability rating for service-connected right great toe scar, which is rated as noncompensable (i.e. zero percent disabling) for the period on appeal under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7805.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7800 is applicable to burn scar(s) of the head, face, or neck; scar(s) of the head, face, or neck due to other causes; or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck. 

DC 7801 is applicable to burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage. DC 7802 is applicable to burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. 

Under DC 7802, which applies to scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted when the area of the scar covers 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or greater.

DC 7804 is applicable to scar(s) that are unstable (i.e., frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar) or painful. A 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two scars that are unstable or painful. A 20 percent rating is warranted for three or four scars that are unstable or painful. A 30 percent rating is warranted for five or more scars that are unstable or painful. Note (1) states that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. Note (2) provides that if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, an additional 10 percent should be added to the evaluation based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. Note (3) states that scars evaluated under DCs 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under this DC, when applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804.

DC 7805 is applicable to other scars and other effects of scars evaluated under DCs 7800 to 7804 and instructs that any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under DCs 7800 through 7804 be evaluated under an appropriate DC. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

The Veteran had a VA examination in August 2019. The Veteran described occasional pain in the toe, but reported that the scar was not unstable. The scar was 7 cm in length by 0.2 cm in width without underlying tissue damage.

The Veteran had another VA examination in October 2019. He reported pain when putting on his shoes. The examiner remarked that the scar was not painful, and measured 7.5 cm in length by 0.2 cm in width without underlying tissue damage. 

The Veteran had another VA examination in April 2022. He reported a throbbing sensation to the right toe and reported that the scar was painful. The scar was 7 cm in length by 0.2 cm in width without underlying tissue damage. 

With the above in mind, the analysis turns to whether a compensable disability rating is warranted at any time during the period on appeal. A compensable rating under DC 7800 is not warranted because the scar is not of the head, face, or neck. A compensable rating under DC 7801 is not warranted because there is no underlying soft tissue damage associated with the scar. A compensable rating under DC 7802 is not warranted because medical evidence persuasively shows that the scar covers less than 144 square inches. A compensable rating under DC 7804, however, is warranted because the evidence indicates that the scar is, indeed, painful. See August 2019 and April 2022 VA examination report Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs). Accordingly, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, and finds that assignment of a 10 percent rating-but no higher, since there is just one scar-is warranted under DC 7804.  

To that extent, the claim is granted.

6. Entitlement to basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 prior to May 22, 2019

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to May 22, 2019, for the award of Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA).  The child or surviving spouse of a Veteran will have basic eligibility if the following conditions are met: (1) The Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021.  Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), effective dates relating to awards under Chapters 30, 31, 32, and 35 of this title or Chapter 106 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 5113.

The Veteran does not have a permanent, total service-connected disability prior to May 22, 2019.  Accordingly, DEA benefits must be effective no earlier than that date.

VA regulations dictate the specific circumstances and criteria which must be met before DEA benefits may be granted.  As these criteria have not been met prior to May 22, 2019, an earlier effective date must be denied as a matter of law.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
