ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 3, 2021, but no earlier, for the evaluation of 70 percent for major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks is granted.  

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of April 2, 2020, but no earlier, for total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The November 2019 rating decision is final.

2. The Veteran's submitted a claim for an increased rating for his major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks on April 2, 2021.

3. Giving benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran, it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability to more nearly approximate a 70 percent evaluation for major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks occurred as of March 3, 2021, but no earlier.

4. The Veteran's claim for a TDIU was part and parcel to his April 2, 2021, increased rating claims.  During the one-year look back period from April 2, 2020, the Veteran met the schedular requirements of a total disability based on individual unemployability and his service-connected disability symptoms prevented him from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of March 3, 2021, but no earlier, for the assignment of a 70 percent evaluation for major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

2. The criteria for an earlier effective date of April 2, 2020, but no earlier, for total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R.§§ 3.102, 3.156, 3.400, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2017 to July 2018.

In the January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2023 decision.  In December 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2023 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 rating decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Dates

The assignment of an effective date for an award of VA disability compensation is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increased compensation shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

An effective date for a claim for increase may be granted prior to the date of claim if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred within one year from the date of claim (emphasis added). See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1) and (2).

Thus, according to Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997), three possible effective dates may be assigned depending on the facts of the particular case:

1)	if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1));

2)	 if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (i.e., the date the increase is factually ascertainable) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2)); or,

3)	if an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2)).

In summary, determining the appropriate effective date for an increased rating under the effective date statutes and regulations involves an analysis of the evidence to determine (1) when a claim for an increased rating was received, and, if possible, (2) when the increase in disability actually occurred.

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 3, 20201, but no earlier, for the evaluation of 70 percent for major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks is granted.  

In a June 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted an increased 70 percent disabling for the Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks, effective April 2, 2021, the date of the increased rating claim.

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than April 2, 2021, for the grant of a 70 percent disability rating for his major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks.  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), it is necessary to determine whether, sometime within one year prior to that date, the Veteran's major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks showed an increase in severity.

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, the assigned 50 percent evaluation contemplated occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks occurring more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material or forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

A 70 percent evaluation is warranted for occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

When determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign, the Board's primary consideration is a Veteran's symptoms, but it must also make findings as to how those symptoms impact a Veteran's occupational and social impairment. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 118 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). Because the use of the term such as in the rating criteria demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, the Board need not find the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms to award a specific rating. Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442; see also Sellers v. Principi, 372 F.3d 1318, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Nevertheless, all ratings in the general rating formula are also associated with objectively observable symptomatology and the plain language of the regulation makes it clear that the Veteran's impairment must be due to those symptoms, a Veteran may only qualify for a given disability by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration. Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 118.

The Board has reviewed the available treatment records and finds that the Veteran submitted an increased rating claim on April 2, 2021.  When reviewing the one-year look back period, it was factually ascertainable that on March 3, 2021, but no earlier, there was an increase in the Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks.

The Board has considered the Veteran's attorney's assertions in the September 8, 2021, HLR and the October 2021 HLR informal conference, that the Veteran's 70 percent evaluation should be effective in March 2021, because the increase in the Veteran's disability was ascertainable as of that date and according to the VA examination (in April 2021) he began to experience chronic suicidal ideations at that time. Then, in the June 2022 HLR and July 2022 informal conference, the attorney claimed that a 70 percent rating was warranted from March 2021, at a minimum, because that is when the Veteran's suicidal ideations began.  

On review of the record, on March 3, 2021, the Veteran was seen in the emergency department at Prattville Hospital for panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder.  Subsequently, VA treatment records dated on March 23, 2021, showed that the Veteran was seen in the VA emergency room department and was diagnosed with excessive worry and anxiety. On March 28, 2021, he was seen in the emergency department with complaints of a racing heart rate, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, insomnia, and arm and leg pain.  He was diagnosed with dehydration and anxiety.  On April 1, 2021, he was seen for a follow-up psychiatric evaluation during which he reported worsening psychiatric symptoms during the past few days and was suicidal at times.  On April 2, 2021, VA received that Veteran's VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, seeking an increased rating for his major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks.  He submitted a statement at the same time in which he reported psychiatric symptoms such as increased visits to medical or counseling clinic, being isolated, having suicidal thoughts or wanting to be dead, feeling hopeless and distrustful, being angry and depressed, obsessive behaviors, heightened flight or fight response, staying home and not wanting to go out, and an increased fear of surroundings.  The symptoms severely affected his relationships, friendships, and daily life.

The Board recognizes that the 70 percent rating criteria do not distinguish between active and passive suicidal ideation and that, in some cases, the mere presence of suicidal ideation (ranging from passive thoughts of one's own death to active thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior), may cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. See Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10 (2017). However, "VA must engage in a holistic analysis in which it assesses the severity, frequency, and duration of the signs and symptoms of the veteran's service-connected mental disorder; quantifies the level of occupational and social impairment caused by those signs and symptoms; and assigns an evaluation that most nearly approximates that level of occupational and social impairment." Bankhead, 29 Vet. App. at 22 (internal citations omitted). In this case, the notations of suicidal ideation (passive or otherwise), when considered with other symptoms, and repeated trips to the emergency department caused the level of occupational and social impairment associated with a 70 percent disability rating, when all doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor and an effective date of March 3, 2021, is warranted.

Regarding whether an effective date earlier than March 3, 2021, is warranted, the Board acknowledges that there are limited records between the one-year look back period between April 2, 2020 and March 3, 2021, the date there was factually ascertainable evidence that the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability increased in severity. Therefore, the Board has considered a March 13, 2020, VA treatment record dated just prior to the one-year look back period.  In this record,  the Veteran declined VA help for mental health intervention and said that he was feeling okay.  He denied having any suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.  Overall, the Veteran did not exhibit symptoms that rose to the type, frequency, or severity consistent with occupational and social impairment corresponding to a 70 percent evaluation at any point from April 2, 2020, up to March 3, 2021.  

The Board has also considered that on an October 2022 supplemental claim application, the Veteran's attorney requested a good cause extension due to COVID-19 and disagreed with a November 2019 rating decision and the assigned disability rating for "PTSD" from June 2019 forward.  In May 2023, the AOJ continued to deny the earlier effective date claim. The Veteran filed an HLR in August 2023 and a December 2023 HLR informal conference report noted that the Veteran's contentions that the claim had been continuously prosecuted.  

On review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran did not continuously pursue the claim following the November 2019 rating decision that awarded an increased 50 percent rating for major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks, effective June 26, 2019.  The Veteran was notified in November 2019 that he had one year from the date of the letter to select a review option in order to protect his initial filing date for effective date purposes.  Yet, he never appealed to the Board or filed Higher-Level of Review (HLR) and the October 2022 supplemental claim referring to the November 2019 rating decision was more than 23 months after the notice of the November 2019 rating decision was issued.  Also, 17 months passed between the issuance of the November 2019 rating decision and when the Veteran filed a VA 21-526 EZ, Fully Developed Claim, in which he specifically identified a claim for increased disabilities regarding his major depressive disorder, moderate with anxious distress.  The November 2019 decision therefore became final. 

Applicable law mandates that the effective date assigned in this circumstance is the date the that the increase is shown to have occurred (i.e., the date the increase is factually ascertainable since the increase in disability) if the increase precedes the claim by a year or less. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).  No earlier date, in sum, is allowable unless the Veteran's untimely filing of his claim can be excused. He has made no argument in this regard. 

The Board has considered 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) and VA Policy Letter 20-02. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) permits the time limit within which a claimant is required to act to challenge an adverse VA decision to be extended for good cause shown. It further specifies that when an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, the action required of the claimant must be taken concurrent with or prior to filing the extension request. Good cause finally must be shown as to why the action required could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. VA Policy Letter 20-02, as updated in August 2020, states that VA will grant requests for an extension of a time limit associated with a required action based on COVID-19 as good cause if the time limit expired or situation occurred on or after March 1, 2020. The letter continues that when an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, the required action must be taken concurrent with or prior to filing the extension request.  38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) and VA Policy Letter 20-02 apply to this matter.

Indeed, the action the Veteran was required to take in order to continuously pursue his claim was filing a supplemental claim. The period he had to take this action spanned from November 2019, after notice of the rating decision that month was issued, to November 2020 a year later.  Part of that time period was after March 1, 2020. This date coincides with the declaration that COVID-19 constituted a national emergency. See Proclamation 9994, Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak, 85 Fed. Reg. 15,337 (Mar. 13, 2020). Further, all of this period was prior to the termination of the national emergency on April 10, 2023. See Joint Resolution, 137 Stat. 6, Pub. L. No. 118-3 (Apr. 10, 2023). The Board nevertheless finds that neither 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) nor VA Policy Letter 20-02 allows for the Veteran's untimely submission of his supplemental claim to be excused.

Simply put, both 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) and VA Policy Letter 20-02 clearly predicate extension of a time limit for a required action on requesting such an extension either prior to or concurrent with taking that action. This means the Veteran must have requested an extension of the time limit for filing his claim either prior to filing that claim or at the same time he filed that claim. No extension request was received prior to his April 2021 claim, and none was received with that claim either. It was only after the April 2021 increased rating claim was adjudicated favorably that the extension was requested; granting the request in this circumstance is not permissible. For this reason alone, the Veteran's untimely submission of his supplemental claim cannot be excused.  Therefore, in April 2021, the Veteran filed a new claim seeking an increased rating for his major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks and the one-year look back shows that it was factually ascertainable that on March 3, 2021, but no earlier, there was an increase in the disability.

The VA Policy Letter 20-02 indicates that a claimant should note his/her request for an extension of a given time limit is because of COVID-19. However, mere mention of COVID-19 is insufficient to convey good cause under 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b). It is simply a general, perfunctory reference to a national emergency which lacks any specific details unique to this matter. Here, for example, how COVID-19 rendered the Veteran unable to timely file his supplemental claim and unable to file it sooner than October 2022, was not explained.  Explaining is particularly important since he had numerous ways in which to file a supplemental claim (online, mail, or having his representative file on his behalf). The Board also notes that an extension was not requested until after the Veteran was awarded an increased 70 percent rating, effective April 2, 2021, the date he filed a new claim for an increased rating and after the AOJ continued to deny his appeal seeking an earlier effective date for the increased 70 percent rating.  

In conclusion, the Veteran has been assigned an effective date of March 3, 2021, for the award of the 70 percent rating corresponding to when it was factually ascertainable in the one-year look back of the April 2, 2021, increased rating claim. This is the earliest effective date allowable by law because the evidence is persuasive that he did not continuously pursue his prior claim by timely filing the supplemental claim. It also is persuasive that this failure cannot be excused. The request to extend the time limit to file the supplemental claim was not received prior to or at the same time as the increased rating claim, as is required regardless of the reason cited for good cause necessitating the extension. COVID-19 further was referenced as good cause here with no further explanation. Therefore, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than March 3, 2021, is not warranted.  

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of April 2, 2020, but no earlier, for total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the award of TDIU.  In the July 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to TDIU with an effective date of January 1, 2021, the first day of the month after which the Veteran claimed that he last worked.  The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date for TDIU is warranted. For reasons discussed below, the Board finds entitlement to an earlier effective date of April 2, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of TDIU is warranted.  

It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities are rated totally disabled. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. A finding of total disability is appropriate when there is any present impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340(a)(1), 4.15.

TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.34l, 4.16(a). In exceptional circumstances, where the Veteran does not meet the percentage requirements, a total rating may nonetheless be assigned upon a showing that the individual is unable to obtain or retain substantially gainful employment due to service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

As a claim seeking entitlement to a TDIU is a type of increased rating claim, the laws governing the assignment of effective dates for these types of claims apply. The effective date assigned is the date of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). However, if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within the one-year period prior to filing the claim, the effective date is the date the increase was shown. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). For reopened claims, the effective date is the date of the new claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r).

Assigning the appropriate effective date for TDIU involves determining (1) when the Veteran's claim for TDIU was received, and if possible, (2) when it became factually ascertainable that the Veteran could not secure and follow gainful employment if the application is received within one year from such date. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.340, 3.400(o)(2), 4.16(a).

For purposes of effective date rules, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU may be considered as part of a claim for underlying benefits (i.e., the service connection claim) or may be considered part of an increased compensation claim (i.e., in conjunction with an increased evaluation claim or as a freestanding claim to obtain an increased evaluation based on unemployability). See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009) (stating that a claim for individual unemployability benefits "involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability or disabilities, either as part of the initial adjudication of a claim or, if a disability upon which entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability is based has already been found to be service connected, as part of a claim for increased compensation"); see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 32-34 (2007) (noting that an award of individual unemployability may not amount to award of increased compensation where individual unemployability is awarded as part of initial award of disability compensation benefits).

When TDIU is raised in connection with an underlying increased rating claim, it is part of the claim for benefits for the underlying disability. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 454 (2009). In those cases, the period on appeal is the same as the underlying increased rating claim.

Regarding the date of the claim, the record reflects, and the Veteran does not dispute, that VA first received an explicit claim for TDIU on October 27, 2021. The Veteran stated that his gastritis and "PTSD" prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful employment. See October 2021 VA Form 21-8940. There is no other explicit claim to TDIU prior to October 27, 2021.

However, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim  for major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks on April 2, 2021. During his April 2021 Mental Disorders VA examination, he reported that he was last employed in December 2020, in which he did Door Dash for five months.  As he indicated that he did not believe that he could work due to his gastritis, stomach ulcers, and mental health issues, his claim for TDIU has been raised as part and partial to his April 2, 2021, increased rating claim.    

Now that the date of claim is established, the Board must consider whether an earlier effective date for TDIU can be assigned based on the one-year look-back period prior to the date the claim was filed, so from April 2, 2020. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110(a), (b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The Board notes that the Veteran met the schedular requirements for a TDIU during the one-year look back period. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Specifically, his major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks was rated as 50 percent disabling from June 26, 2019 and 70 percent from March 3, 2021; obstructive sleep apnea rated as 50 percent disabling from July 21, 2018; bilateral tinnitus rated as 10 percent from July 21, 2018; right knee patellar tendonitis with pes anserine tendonitis rated as 10 percent from July 21, 2018; right knee limitation of extension rated as noncompensable from July 21, 2018; and gastroesophageal reflux disease with gastric ulcer and functional dyspepsia rated as 10 percent disabling from April 2, 2021. During the period in question from April 2, 2020, to April 2, 2021, his combined disability rating was 80 percent from June 26, 2019, and 90 percent from March 2, 2021.

Here, as the Veteran reported that he last worked in December 2020, he was assigned an effective date of January 1, 2021.  The Veteran In correspondence received in March 2022, the Veteran's representative claimed that the Veteran has not worked in a full-time capacity since he left service.  He only worked for Walmart for one month, and then he worked on a part-time bases for Door Dash, where he made only marginal wages and worked as his disabilities allowed.  During his December 2023 HLR Informal Conference, he alleged that his employment was only marginal in prior to January 1, 2021.  

On his October 2021 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported that he worked 20 hours a week at Door Dash from June to December 2020 and made $933.00 a month.  During the one-year look back period, the Veteran's income did not exceed the poverty threshold dictated by the US Census Bureau. Thus, he is not considered to have engaged in substantially gainful employment during that period. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the Veteran entitled to an effective date of April 2, 2020, for the grant of TDIU.

The Board has considered the Veteran and his attorney's contentions that the October 24, 2019, VA examination raised the issue of unemployability when the Veteran stated that he was unable to hold a job due to the number of medical appointments that he had to attend for his service-connected disabilities. He alleged that the November 2019 rating decision had been continuously appealed and that he disagreed with the assigned rating for "PTSD" from June 2019 forward, to include TDIU raised as part and parcel of the appeal. See October 2022 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim.  The Board notes that the November 2019 rating decision increased the Veteran's disability rating for major depressive disorder with anxious distress and panic attacks to 50 percent disabling, effective June 26, 2019.   As discussed in further detail above, the Veteran never appealed to the Board or filed Higher-Level of Review (HLR) and the October 2022 supplemental claim referring to the November 2019 rating decision was more than 23 months after the notice of the November 2019 rating decision was issued.  Also, 17 months passed between the issuance of the November 2019 rating decision and when the Veteran filed a VA 21-526 EZ, Fully Developed Claim, in which he specifically identified a claim for increased disabilities regarding service-connected sleep apnea, right knee patellar tendonitis with pes anserine tendonitis, and major depressive disorder, moderate with anxious distress.  The November 2019 decision therefore became final.  Consequently, the Board finds the Veteran did not have a prior claim of TDIU or an increased rating wherein TDIU was part and parcel of the claim that remained pending. 

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of April 2, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of a TDIU is warranted. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
