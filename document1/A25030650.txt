REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected bilateral hearing loss (BHL) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1984 to December 1986.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2024, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In August 2024, a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), was received, electing the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of the Veteran's right to change Board dockets under Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected BHL.

The Board finds that remand is needed in order to address the following duty to assist errors.  Specifically, the Board finds that there may be outstanding treatment records to obtain and to associate with the claim file.  For example, in April 2024, there appears to be a photograph of treatment records associated with the claim file.  See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility, April 2024.  In addition, for some of the records in the photograph, it appears that only portions of these records can be seen.  Upon remand, the Board asks that any outstanding relevant treatment records be obtained and associated with the claim file.

Further, in January 2024, VA Forms 21-4142, and 21-4142a, were associated with the claim file, identifying a medical provider.  Then, in January 2024, a Medical Records Request Reject Notice was associated with the claim file.  The Board asks that the Veteran be informed of the status of this records request, if not already so informed.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

After securing any necessary consent forms from the Veteran, obtain any outstanding relevant treatment records, to include any private and/or VA treatment records, to include records contained in repositories accessible through VA, pertaining to the issues on appeal.

Further, in January 2024, VA Forms 21-4142, and 21-4142a, were associated with the claim file, identifying a medical provider.  Then, in January 2024, a Medical Records Request Reject Notice was associated with the claim file.  The Board asks that the Veteran be informed of the status of this records request, if not already so informed.

Obtain all necessary consent.  All efforts should be documented in the claim file.  If any records could not be obtained, this should be noted in the claim file.
