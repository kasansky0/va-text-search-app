REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1970 to June 1972.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from  July and October 2020 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that declined to readjudicate the claim of service connection for marginal zone lymphoma because the evidence submitted was not new and relevant and confirmed and continued the previous denials of the claims of service connection for pancreatic cancer, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine cancer, and sleep apnea.  The Board is bound by the favorable findings in the decision that the Veteran has diagnoses of marginal zone lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine cancer, and sleep apnea, and the Veteran was exposed to ionizing radiation in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran timely appealed the July and October 2020 rating decisions in a January 2021 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and selected a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(b)(2).  The Veteran testified during a virtual Board hearing in March 2025, although a transcript of the hearing is not necessary given that the Board is granting the benefits sought in full.  Accordingly, the Board will review the evidence of record as of the date of the February 2020 rating decision that led to the Higher-Level Review Request and the July 2020 rating decision that confirmed and continued the previous denial of the claim of service connection for sleep apnea, evidence of record as of the date of the October 2020 rating decisions, evidence submitted at the March 2025 Board hearing, and evidence submitted within 90 days following the hearing.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.  The Board will not consider evidence added to the record in between the date of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal and the date of the hearing or added to the record more than 90 days after the date of the hearing.  If evidence was added during any ineligible period, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, he may at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

Whether new and relevant evidence was presented to warrant readjudication of the claim of service connection for marginal zone lymphoma

In April 2019, the AOJ denied the claim of service connection for marginal zone lymphoma.  VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501(a)(1).  "New" evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).  "Relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue.  Id. 

In this case, new evidence was presented after the most recent denial in April 2019 that is relevant to the Veteran's claim.  Specifically, a February 2020 opinion from a private physician found that the Veteran's marginal zone lymphoma was caused by or a result of his exposures in service at a nuclear power plant.  This opinion was not already of record and may prove or disprove the nexus element of the claim of service connection on appeal.  Readjudication of the claim is therefore warranted.

Entitlement to service connection for marginal zone lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, and esophagus, stomach, and small intestine cancer

The Veteran contends that his lung, pancreatic, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine cancer are related to exposure to ionizing radiation while he was stationed at McMurdo Station in Antarctica.

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

For the following reasons, entitlement to service connection for marginal zone lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, and esophagus, stomach, and small intestine cancer is warranted.  

The Board is bound by the favorable findings in October 2020 rating decisions that the Veteran has diagnoses of marginal zone lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine cancer.  Therefore, the Veteran meets the current disability requirement for the claims.  The Board is also bound by the favorable finding in the October 2020 rating decision that the Veteran was exposed to ionizing radiation in service.  Thus, the Veteran meets the in-service injury requirement for the claims. 

In February 2020, a private physician completed a review of the Veteran's service and post-service treatment records and found that the Veteran's marginal zone lymphoma and pancreatic cancer were most likely caused by or a result of exposure to ionizing radiation in service at a nuclear power plant.  This opinion is entitled to some probative weight as the physician explained the reason for the conclusion based on an accurate characterization of the evidence of record.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning); Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record).  Moreover, although the physician did not explicitly state that the Veteran's esophagus, stomach, and small intestine cancer were related to his exposure to ionizing radiation in service, the physician reasoned in the opinion that exposure to ionizing radiation can cause cancer.  Thus, although the phrasing in the opinion is somewhat ambiguous, the Board will interpret the opinion in the manner most favorable to the Veteran and find that it supports a causal relationship between the Veteran's esophagus, stomach, and small intestine cancer and exposure to ionizing radiation in service.  Cf. Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 118 (1994) (in construing veterans' law, "interpretive doubt is to be resolved in the Veteran's favor").  In addition, another February 2020 private opinion that found the Veteran's pancreatic cancer was not caused by or a result of radiation exposure because most pancreatic tumors are sporadic and happen with no cause is entitled some probative weight as the physician explained the reason for the conclusion based on an accurate characterization of the evidence of record.  Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 294 at 304; Acevedo, 25 Vet. App. at 294.  

Therefore, for the above reasons, the evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's marginal zone lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, and esophagus, stomach, and small intestine cancer are related to his exposure to ionizing radiation during active duty service.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for marginal zone lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, and esophagus, stomach, and small intestine cancer is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, secondary to service-connected chronic sinusitis

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).

The Veteran contends that his sleep apnea is related to his service-connected chronic sinusitis.  For the following reasons, the evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea was caused by his service-connected chronic sinusitis.

The Board is bound by the favorable finding in the July 2020 rating decision of the Veteran's diagnosis of sleep apnea.  Thus, the Veteran meets the current disability requirement for the claim.

A March 2020 VA treatment record that noted that sleep apnea was linked to service-connected sinusitis is entitled to some probative weight even though the VA opinion did not provide an extensive rationale.  Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012) (the fact that the rationale provided by an examiner "did not explicitly lay out the examiner's journey from the facts to a conclusion," did not render the examination inadequate); Acevedo, 25 Vet. App. at 294.

Moreover, a February 2020 VA opinion that found that the Veteran's sleep apnea was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of service-connected chronic sinusitis, in part, because there was no diagnosis of sinusitis is not probative as it was based on the inaccurate factual premise that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of sinusitis.  Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise is not probative).

Thus, for the above reasons, the evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea is caused by his service-connected chronic sinusitis.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, secondary to service-connected chronic sinusitis, on a causation basis, is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
