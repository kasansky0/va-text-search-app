ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disorder, diagnosed as cervical spondylosis, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's cervical spine disorder, diagnosed as cervical spondylosis, is at least as likely as not related to his active duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disorder, diagnosed as cervical spondylosis, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1154, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Navy from November 1968 to August 1977.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision.  As this rating decision constitutes an initial decision, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the December 17, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on April 1, 2025.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1.  Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disorder.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show:  (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 38 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  The absence of any one element will result in denial of service connection.

Service connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Every veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.  38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).  Only conditions recorded on examination reports are considered "noted" at entry into service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).  History provided by the veteran of the pre-service existence of conditions recorded at the time of the entrance examination does not, in itself, constitute a notation of a preexisting condition.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304(b)(1); Paulson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 466, 470 (1995); Crowe v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 238, 246 (1995).

In cases where the presumption of soundness attaches, the burden shifts to the Secretary to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that: "(1) a disease or injury existed prior to service; and (2) the disease or injury was not aggravated by service."  Patrick v. Shinseki, 668 F.3d 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citing Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (emphasis added).  The second prong of the presumption of soundness is rebutted if there is clear and unmistakable evidence either that (1) there was no increase in disability during service, or (2) any increase in disability was due to the natural progression of the condition.  Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096; see also Quirin v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. at 397.

Clear and unmistakable evidence is a more formidable evidentiary burden than the preponderance of the evidence standard.  See Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254, 258 (1999) (noting that "clear and convincing" burden of proof, while a higher standard than a preponderance of the evidence, is a lower burden to satisfy than clear and unmistakable evidence).  It is an "onerous" evidentiary standard, requiring that the no-aggravation result be "undebatable."  Cotant v. West, 17 Vet. App. 116, 131 (2003) (citing Laposky v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 331, 334 (1993) (citing Akins v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 228, 232 (1991)) and Vanerson, 12 Vet. App. at 258, 261; id. at 263 (Nebeker, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Concerning clear and unmistakable evidence that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service, the second step necessary to rebut the presumption of soundness, a lack of aggravation may be shown by establishing that there was no increase in disability during service, or that any increase in disability was due to the natural progress of the preexisting condition.  Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096; 38 U.S.C. § 1153.

The Veteran contends that he has a cervical spine disorder that is directly related to his active duty service.  In the September 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made the favorable finding that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability based on a recent VA examination that showed a diagnosis of cervical spondylosis.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c); June 2024 VA examination.  

The AOJ also favorably found that the evidence showed that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during the Veteran's service as a July 15, 1977 service treatment record (STR) showed that the Veteran suffered a neck fracture in service.  In this regard, it appears that the AOJ was referencing a July 15, 1977 Report of Medical History in which the Veteran reported a history of broken bones as well as a history of being a patient in any type of hospital.  This record explained that the Veteran suffered a fractured neck, seatbelt burns, and a concussion in an automobile accident that occurred in August 1966.  The record indicated that the Veteran received treatment at a private hospital from Dr. P in relation to this injury.  Consequently, this record supports that the fractured neck injury referenced in the favorable finding actually occurred prior to service in 1966.

The STRs also include a November 19, 1968 letter from Dr. P., MD, regarding this pre-service injury.  Dr. P. noted that he treated the Veteran from August 1966 to December 1966 for a fracture of the odontoid process.  However, this injury healed completely without any sign of disability.  A November 20, 1968 stamp on the letter reflects that Dr. P.'s letter was reviewed and considered in the Veteran's profile.

The corresponding November 20, 1968 enlistment examination shows that the Veteran's head, face, neck, and scalp as well as his spine/other musculoskeletal functioning were found to be normal on clinical evaluation.  The notes section referenced Dr. P.'s letter in relation to the Veteran's history of a neck fracture and indicated that an orthopedic consultation was needed.  A separate line under this section dated on November 20, 1968 indicated that an x-ray revealed an old, healed odontoid fracture that was in good position with no subluxation.  The note added that this complaint was not considered disabling.  The section also noted that the orthopedic consultation resulted in a normal examination with no neurological deficit, again stating that this issue was not considered disabling.  This information is consistent with the details noted in separate entries from the STRs regarding the findings from a November 20, 1968 cervical spine x-ray and a November 20, 1968 orthopedic consultation report regarding the cervical spine.  Notably, the orthopedic consultation also noted that the Veteran had normal range of motion and indicated that there was no disability now following the history of treatment for the 1966 automobile accident.

In addition, the November 20, 1968 enlistment examination reflects that the Veteran was given a previous P1 rating for physical capacity or stamina in the PULHES physical profile.  See Odiorne v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 456, 457 (1992). PULHES reflects the overall physical and psychiatric condition on a scale of 1 (high level of fitness) to 4 (a medical condition or physical that is below the level of medical fitness for retention in the military service).  Id.  The November 20, 1968 Report of Medical History provided details consistent with the information from the enlistment examination.  The Veteran reported a history of broken bones and treatment for a fractured neck from Dr. P.  The physician's summary referenced Dr. P.'s letter regarding the Veteran's history of a fracture of the odontoid process in 1966 with complete healing.

A subsequent November 1970 discharge and immediate reenlistment examination did not note any relevant abnormalities on clinical evaluation, and no cervical spine disorder was documented elsewhere in the report.  On August 16, 1972, a consultation was requested in relation to the Veteran's complaint of pain in the base of his neck as well as behind both eyes.  The record noted that the Veteran fractured his neck approximately 6 years ago and was given medication in the form of a yellow and white tablet.  The Veteran had an allergic reaction and was unable to recall the medication name.  The August 16, 1972 consultation report stated that in relation to the injury 6 years ago, the Veteran was in traction for 3 weeks and appeared to note that he had a brace for 6 months to treat the fractured odontoid process.  The Veteran currently had a lingering bilateral, frontal headache and occipital neck pain that had been present for three days.  The impression was frontal headache with post-neck tightness.  The provider appeared to add that no organic disease was demonstrated.

A November 5, 1974 consultation request later noted that the Veteran had an old fracture of the odontoid process, and he now had pain in the same area on rotation of the head.  The November 12, 1974 consultation report noted an impression of old fracture to the tip of the odontoid and pain with rotation at times that was probably secondary to callus formation.

Later in November 1976, a service examination continued to mark the Veteran's head, face, neck, and scalp as well as the spine/other musculoskeletal functioning as normal in the clinical evaluation.  The notes section referenced the pre-service neck fracture and related history of hospitalization with traction followed by treatment with wearing a brace for 6 months.  The record indicated that the Veteran currently had occasional neck pain with extension of the neck.  The associated November 1976 Report of Medical History shows that beneath the recurrent back pain option, the Veteran wrote in a category to report his history of neck complaints.  Largely consistent with the information in previously discussed STRs, the Veteran also reported being hospitalized for 3 weeks in September 1966 for a fractured neck with treatment from Dr. P.  The physician's summary reiterated the details noted in the November 1976 examination report and similarly stated that the Veteran now had occasional neck pain with different positions.

In conjunction with the July 15, 1977 Report of Medical History referenced above, the STRs include a July 15, 1977 separation examination.  This examination did not note any relevant abnormalities in the clinical evaluation, and cervical spine complaints were not documented in other sections of the report.  However, the Board notes that the Veteran did report his history of broken bones and the pre-service hospitalization for the 1966 neck fracture in the July 15, 1977 Report of Medical History.  No other details were noted in the physician's summary.

Regarding the Veteran's history of relevant symptoms, the Veteran and his wife provided pertinent details in their April 2025 Board hearing testimony.  Notably, the Veteran and wife became married prior to his entrance into active duty.  Their testimony reflects that the November 19, 1968 letter from Dr. P. indicating that the Veteran did not experience any residual neck disability after his treatment for the 1966 fracture was an accurate depiction of the Veteran's pre-service symptoms as the Veteran and his wife testified that he had no neck problems prior to service.  Instead, their testimony indicated that his current neck problems began in conjunction with the physical activities associated with his in-service duties.  The Veteran repaired and calibrated electronic equipment during service, and the Veteran hurt his neck one time in the course of these duties after he had to lay on the floor to complete these tasks.  The Veteran sought treatment for his neck while stationed in Germany, and a doctor informed him that the Veteran's vertebrae were not properly placed, and he needed a neck fusion surgery.  However, as the Veteran did not want to undergo the surgery, he never attempted to seek treatment for his neck again during service.  The Veteran's wife additionally confirmed the in-service event that preceded the Veteran's neck pain as well as the medical advice the Veteran received during service regarding the need for a neck fusion surgery.  In addition, the Veteran and his wife testified that the Veteran had experienced chronic neck pain since service with the Veteran eventually undergoing surgery in 2024.

The Board notes that the Veteran and his wife are competent to report as to the observable events and neck symptoms the Veteran experienced and their history.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Veteran's DD 214 shows that the Veteran's in-service military occupational specialty (MOS) had the related civilian occupation of electronics mechanic.  A stamp in the November 12, 1974 consultation report when the Veteran sought treatment for pain in cervical spine area with the rotation of his head also reflects that it was completed at a United States Hospital in Augsburg, Germany.  In addition, the VA examiner who conducted the June 2024 cervical spine VA examination also noted that the Veteran had neck surgery in April 2024, and separate June 2024 VA examination related to scars indicated that procedure was a cervical foraminotomy.  The Board consequently accepts the Veteran's assertion that he began to have neck pain during service in the course of calibrating and repairing electronic equipment to be credible and consistent with his service.  38 C.F.R. § 1154(a).  The Board also finds the reported history from the Veteran and his wife that he experienced chronic neck pain since it began during service to be credible as their reports have been largely consistent throughout the appeal period and are supported by the details from the available in-service and post-service evidence.

The Board notes that although the Veteran's history of the 1966 fracture of the odontoid process and related treatment was noted in the November 20, 1968 enlistment examination, no current cervical spine disorder was documented in the report.  As such, the presumption of soundness of applies.  Moreover, there is no evidence to indicate that the relevant cervical spine disorder pain for which the Veteran sought treatment during service preceded his period of active duty to rebut the presumption of soundness.  As discussed above, both the Veteran and his wife have provided competent and credible testimony to support that the Veteran had no neck problems at the time of his entrance into active duty, and the chronic neck pain associated with the Veteran's current cervical spine disorder began during service.  This report is consistent with the information in Dr. P.'s November 19, 1968 letter as well as the November 20, 1968 orthopedic consultation indicating that there was no current cervical spine disability following the Veteran's successful treatment for the automobile accident neck injury in 1966.  The Board finds that the foregoing evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that the Veteran had a cervical spine disorder that clearly and unmistakably preexisted his active duty service.  Thus, the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted, and the claim will be considered on the basis of direct service connection.

Regarding the question of a nexus, the June 2024 VA examiner provided a negative opinion.  In the rationale, the examiner noted that the Veteran had claimed neck pain as being directly related to military service.  Based on a review of the available evidence, it was less likely than not that the claimed condition was due to service as there was a lack of substantiating evidence supporting a nexus between the current diagnosis of cervical spondylosis and military service.  Without chronicity during service or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury was considered to be a more likely etiology.  Although the Board has considered the examiner's opinion, the Board finds that it has minimal probative value as the examiner's rationale citing to the lack of chronicity during or after service does not reflect sufficient consideration of the Veteran's competent and credible reports indicating that he has continued to experience chronic neck pain since it began during service in conjunction with the physical activities of his job duties therein.  In addition, the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence does not warrant a conclusion of a lack of nexus.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

In summary, the Board has considered the Veteran's competent and credible reports of cervical spine pain that has continued to be present since it began during service.  In addition, the negative opinion provided by the June 2024 VA examiner is not more probative than the Veteran's competent and credible history indicating continued complaints since his active duty service.  Based on this evidence, the Board finds that the most probative evidence establishes a nexus between active duty service and the Veteran's current cervical spine disorder.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disorder, diagnosed as cervical spondylosis, is therefore granted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (service connection must be considered on the basis of the places, types, and circumstances of his service as shown by his service records, the official history of each organization in which he served, his medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence); see also Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("[N]othing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] require both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself").  As the Board is granting entitlement to service connection on this basis, it is unnecessary to address any other theory of entitlement that has been advanced.

The claim for service connection for a neck disability is granted.
