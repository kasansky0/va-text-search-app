ORDER

A total rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) prior to October 25, 2024, is denied.

Special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound status prior to October 25, 2024, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to his service-connected disabilities during the one-year prior to filing for TDIU on October 25, 2024.

2. The Veteran's TDIU is effective October 25, 2024, and is therefore the earliest possible date entitlement to SMC at the statutory housebound rate is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 25, 2024, for the grant of a TDIU are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. 

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to October 25, 2024, for the grant of SMC based on the housebound criteria are not. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Navy from December 1967 to October 1971. He received the Combat Action Ribbon.

The Veteran timely appealed the February 27, 2025, decision to the Board and selected Direct Review in a March 2025 VA Form 10182 and only appealed the above issues. The Veteran, through his attorney representative, submitted a written waiver of the remaining time to change appeal lanes in March 2025 so the Board will proceed with tis appeal. See 3/21/2025, Third Party Correspondence; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c).

Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of February 27, 2025-the date of the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after February 27, 2025, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Effective Date

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and an award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim or a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date the claim arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after discharge from service.

Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if the formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claim for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of the receipt of the formal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

For claims for an increase in a service-connected disability, if an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of claim. If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); VAOPGCPREC 12-98.

1. Entitlement to a TDIU prior to October 25, 2024

The Veteran, through his attorney representative, asserts entitlement to TDIU effective March 26, 2014. See 3/21/2025, Third Party Correspondence. Specifically, they contend the Veteran met the schedular criteria for TDIU in the March 2014 claim and therefore his claim did not become final as TDIU was reasonably raised by VA examinations. The representative explained that as the Veteran's disorders remained the same today as they did in 2014, then he should receive TDIU effective March 2014. 

The February 2025 rating decision granted TDIU effective October 25, 2024, the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim via a VA 21-526EZ and a VA 21-8940. For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU is not warranted. 

A total disability rating may be granted where the schedular rating is less than 100 percent and the veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. Generally, to be eligible for a TDIU, a percentage threshold must be met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

In determining unemployability for VA purposes, consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to age or any impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Hersey v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 91, 94 (1992); Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000). The sole fact that a veteran is unemployed or has difficulty securing employment is not enough, as a high rating in itself is a recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment. The question is whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993) (citing 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.15, 4.16(a)). Entitlement to TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstances. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the term unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 has two components. First, there is an economic component which essentially contemplates an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. A protected environment "is a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024). Second, there is a non-economic component dealing with the individual veteran's ability to follow and secure employment. For the second component, attention must be given to: (a) the veteran's history, education, skill and training, (b) the veteran's physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities (e.g., sedentary, light, medium, heavy or very heavy) required by the occupation at issue, with relevant factors such as lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, reaching, auditory and visual, and (c) whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue, with relevant factors such as memory, concentration, and ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers and demonstrate reliability and productivity. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 72-73 (2019).

The Court has stated that "a veteran can establish marginal employment either by demonstrating an income less than the poverty threshold established by the U.S. Census Bureau or by the facts of his particular case." Ortiz-Valles v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 65, 71 (2016) (emphasis in original). Regardless of the method, "if the evidence or facts reflect that a veteran is capable only of marginal employment, he [or she] is incapable of securing or following a substantially gainful occupation and is therefore entitled to [TDIU] if his service-connected disabilities are the cause of that incapability." Id.  

In making a determination, the Board must consider all the evidence of record and make appropriate determinations of competence, credibility, and weight. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, all reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Moreover, entitlement to TDIU may be an element of an appeal for a higher rating. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Entitlement to a TDIU is raised where a veteran: (1) submits evidence of a medical disability; (2) makes a claim for the highest rating possible; and (3) submits evidence of unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001; see Jackson v. Shinseki, 587 F.3d 1106, 1109-10 (2009) (holding that an inferred claim for a TDIU is raised as part of an increased rating claim only when the Roberson requirements are met).

Recently, the Court explained TDIU can be raised at various stages of the claims process and arises when VA rates a disability. Because TDIU can arise any time VA is rating a disability, VA may need to address TDIU as part of separate claim streams when rating different disabilities. TDIU, when part of a claim for increase, is not a separate claim for benefits that VA can grant or deny unmoored from the underlying service connection or increased rating claim. Rather, TDIU is part of that underlying claim, as an option for a potential rating, and the eventual effective date depends on the specific claim VA is then adjudicating. Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394, 400 (2024). 

Turning to the evidence of record and by relevant procedural history, the Veteran filed claims for service connection in March 2014. See 3/26/2014, VA 21-526EZ. A June 2015 rating decision granted service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II and denied service connection for a left knee injury. See 6/19/2015, Rating Decision - Narrative. Additional diabetes mellitus and neuropathy examinations were obtained in July 2015, and a July 2015 rating decision continued the rating for diabetes mellitus and granted service connection for bilateral upper and lower extremity neuropathy. In June 2016, the Veteran only appealed the denial of the left knee injury in the June 2015 rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal the July 2015 rating decision. A November 2017 rating decision granted service connection for a left knee disorder and other related residuals. See 11/28/2017, Rating Decision - Narrative. The Veteran did not appeal the November 2017 rating decision. The next rating decision in the claims file is the February 2025 rating decision that is currently on appeal.

The Veteran filed a formal application for TDIU (VA 21-8940) on October 25, 2024, and a VA 21-526EZ on October 25, 2024, seeking an increased rating for diabetes mellitus as well as entitlement to TDIU. See 10/25/2024, VA 21-526EZ; 21-8940. There is no indication from the claims file that an intent to file was submitted in the year prior to his October 25, 2024, VA 21-8940 and accompanying VA 21-526EZ fully developed claim listing TDIU. TDIU was granted in a February 2025 rating decision with an effective date of October 25, 2024. 

The Veteran meets the schedular criteria for TDIU from March 26, 2014, onward as he has a combined 70 percent or higher rating with his left knee disorder rated at 60 percent, and other disorders. Therefore, his combined evaluation for compensation due to his service-connected disabilities meets the percentage rating standards for TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) from March 26, 2014, onward. He receives a TDIU from October 25, 2024.

The Veteran's VA Form 21-8940 shows he last worked July 5, 2005, which is also the date he last worked full time. See 10/25/2025, VA 21-8940. 

In this matter, the Board finds that TDIU prior to October 25, 2024, is not warranted. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contentions to include the effective date for the increased rating for TDIU should go back to the date he met the schedular requirement for TDIU and that there was evidence of unemployability in the VA examinations. However, following a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that assignment of an earlier effective date is not warranted in this appeal. In support of this, the Board finds that the date the Veteran met the schedular requirement for TDIU, to include the date entitlement arose, is outside the one-year look back period from the date he filed his formal request for a TDIU, which was the predicate filing resulting in the February 2025 rating decision leading to the instant appeal stream under the modernized review system. 

Further, the record, including VA treatment records, does not show that it is factually ascertainable during the one-year look back period (from the date of his October 25, 2024, VA Form 21-8940 and 21-526EZ) that the Veteran was unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disorders. Indeed, the Veteran's attorney representative states that the Veteran's disorders have remained constant since service connection was granted in the June and July 2015 rating decisions. The evidence of record shows the Veteran's disorders have been consistent since service connection was granted, which is more than one year prior to the Veteran's submitted October 25, 2024, VA Form 21-8940/21-526EZ. As such, the date entitlement arose is more than a year prior to October 25, 2024. Here, the effective date for TDIU is dependent upon the date of the claim for increase, which in this case is October 25, 2024, when he submitted both a VA Form 21-8940 as well as a VA Form 21-526EZ listing TDIU. Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394, 400 (2024).

The Board also acknowledges the assertions regarding evidence of unemployability due to his diabetes mellitus which was granted in the June 2015 rating decision. However, the Veteran did not appeal that decision nor was new and material evidence submitted within a year of it rendering it non-final, and the Board finds that an appeal stream that might implicate TDIU for service-connected connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, is not now before the Board in this appeals stream. Therefore, TDIU cannot be inferred in this appeal stream as the issue of an increased rating for diabetes mellitus, type II, is not part of this appeal. The Board determines that the appeal stream regarding an earlier effective for TDIU started on October 25, 2024, with the Veteran's submission of VA Forms 21-526EZ and 21-8940. 

Therefore, an earlier effective date prior to October 25, 2024, is not warranted. Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim for earlier effective date for TDIU and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

2. Entitlement to special monthly compensation based on housebound status prior to October 25, 2024

The Veteran, through his attorney representative, asserts entitlement to SMC effective March 26, 2014. See 3/21/2025, Third Party Correspondence. Specifically, they contend the Veteran met the schedular criteria for TDIU in the March 2014 claim and therefore his claim did not become final as TDIU was reasonably raised by VA examinations. The representative explained that as the Veteran's disorders remained the same today as they did in 2014, then he should receive SMC effective March 2014. 

SMC at the housebound rate is payable if a Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent and has an additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i). A TDIU rating based on a single disability is permitted to satisfy the statutory requirement of a 100 percent rating. Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008).

(CONTINUED ON THE NEXT PAGE)

?

Here, as discussed above, the effective date for the grant of a TDIU, is October 25, 2024. Prior to October 25, 2024, the Veteran had a rating of 90 percent. As such, prior to October 25, 2024, the Veteran does not have a disability that is rated at 100 percent, nor does he have an additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability. As such, the requirements for SMC at the statutory housebound rate are met from October 25, 2024, and no earlier. Accordingly, an effective date prior to October 25, 2024, for the grant of a SMC at the statutory housebound rate, is denied.
