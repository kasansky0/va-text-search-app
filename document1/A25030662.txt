ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

The December 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) seeking service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus was an impermissible concurrent election and was docketed by the Board in error.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 7105, 7108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400, 3.2500, 20.201, 20.202, 20.205.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 7105, 7108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400, 3.2500, 20.201, 20.202. 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Air Force from February 1962 to February 1966, with additional service in the Air Force Reserve. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) thanks the Veteran for his service to our country.

This matter is before the Board on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In December 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected a Hearing with a Veterans Law Judge.

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus must be dismissed as a matter of law.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) framework, there are three review lanes: (1) Supplemental Claim, (2) Higher-Level Review, and (3) Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. If a request for review under one of these three lanes is pending final adjudication, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different lane without first withdrawing the pending review request. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(d), (e), 20.205.

After a claimant elects one of the three available review options, the claimant may not take another action with respect to the same claim until the Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board is adjudicated; or the elected request for Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board is withdrawn.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

Recently, in Terry v. McDonough, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) emphasized that concurrent elections are prohibited. The Court held that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option." Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 14 (2023). The Court's holding was expressly predicated on finding that multiple administrative review requests were "not pending concurrently," as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A). Id. Accordingly, the Court's holding in Terry makes it perfectly clear that only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues.

In March 2024, the Veteran filed an initial claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. In a July 2024 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of these two claims.

While the Veteran's Supplemental Claim was pending, he submitted the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), expressing disagreement with the July 2024 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.

The Veteran's August 2024 Supplemental Claim is currently pending adjudication by the AOJ.

The Board finds that acceptance and docketing of the December 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), as to the issues of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, was prohibited by law. In this regard, the Veteran had a valid Supplemental Claim pending at the AOJ at the time he filed his VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), and he did not withdraw his Supplemental Claim. As such, the VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) represents concurrent election in violation of 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). Accordingly, the December 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) does not constitute a valid appeal to the Board.

The Board may dismiss an appeal for a procedural defect, such as improper docketing of an appeal. See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021). Due to this procedural defect, the Board will dismiss the claim for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and entitlement to service connection for tinnitus. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); Terry, 37 Vet. App. 1.

Because the present appeal is a concurrent election prohibited under controlling law and regulation, the appeal must be dismissed.
