REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1964 to October 1968. 

In March 2025, he filed a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice Of Disagreement)) seeking to appeal a September 18, 1968, rating decision addressing hypertension. He elected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge as the Board review option. 

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension 

Based on the procedural history of this appeal, the Veteran violated a claims-processing rule in filing his March 2025 VA Form 10182. A decision of an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) may be appealed by filing a notice of disagreement with the decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(a). Here, there is no appealable determination of record addressing hypertension.

In his March 2025 VA Form 10182, the Veteran addressed his hypertension and indicated that he wanted to appeal a September 18, 1968, decision, but no such decision exists. By history, the Veteran first filed a claim for service connection for hypertension in March 2010, and in a May 2011 rating decision, the AOJ denied the claim. In August 2012, the Veteran again claimed entitlement to service connection for hypertension, and the AOJ denied that claim in March 2014 on the basis that new and material evidence had not been submitted. The Veteran appealed this decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), and the Board denied reopening the claim in a decision issued in July 2018. The Veteran did not appeal the Board's decision. 

In September 2024, he filed another claim for service connection for hypertension. In a December 2024 VA letter, the Veteran was informed that his most recent claim for service connection for hypertension was submitted on an incorrect form, and needed to be refiled on the proper form as identified in the letter.  

In a March 2025 letter, the Board acknowledged receipt of the Veteran's VA Form 10182 without considering claims-processing rules. It is now clear that, due to the absence of a determination of record on the claim for service connection for hypertension, the Board cannot issue a decision in response to the filing of the March 2025 VA Form 10182 and must dismiss the intended appeal on that claim. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.201.
