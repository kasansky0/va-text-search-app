REMANDED

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the cost of medication expenses associated with non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) emergency medical treatment on August 3, 2024, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1963 to August 1965.

The decision on appeal was issued in August 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In his December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding this claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in its subsequent adjudication of this claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the cost of medication expenses associated with non-VA emergency medical treatment on August 3, 2024

With his VA Form 10182, the Veteran submitted a statement that the VA clinic near his home was closed on Saturdays and that he had to seek emergency treatment; he received prescription medications that he was required to take immediately.  He then followed up with his VA primary care doctor and was instructed to submit to the VA reimbursement of the costs for his prescription medications. 

An August 22, 2024, Explanation of Payment (EOP) of record states prescription reimbursement is not associated with a VA approved urgent / emergent care or a VA preapproved Community Care visit. 

An August 26, 2024, EOP provided the following explanations for why the Veteran's claim was denied: (1) prescription reimbursement is not associated with a VA approved urgent / emergent care or a VA preapproved Community Care visit; and (2) co-payment reimbursement is not allowed.

There is no evidence that the Veteran sought reimbursement for the August 3, 2024, non-VA episode of care, other than for the prescribed medications. There are no medical records, clinical tracking, explanation of benefits, or a decision letter of record nor was the Veteran asked to submit information regarding his claim or any missing documentation in the claim file.

The Board cannot discern from the current record whether the Veteran meets the eligibility requirements for payment or reimbursement of his non-VA emergency prescriptions related to his non-VA medical treatment. There is no documentation reflecting which non-VA facility the Veteran obtained treatment from, nor are there any private treatment records or billing records. As such, the Board cannot make a determination as to whether the Veteran meets the eligibility criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 70.20(a)(1).

Additionally, the denial letter is not of record. Without adequate notice of the basis for the denial, a claimant cannot make an informed decision as to whether to accept or appeal the decision nor can he know what evidence to submit to substantiate the appeal. See Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 252 (2007). The Veteran was not put on notice of what additional evidence or argument could be presented to support an appeal. On remand, the AOJ must provide the Veteran with complete notice of the decision as required by 38 U.S.C. § 5104, including identification of whether the claim meets each of the criteria necessary for payment under 38 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1725, or 1728.

Under the AMA framework, the Board may remand an issue to correct any pre-decisional duty to assist or notify errors it identifies. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. Such an error exists in this case. The Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error as the private treatment records and billing records were not obtained and the Veteran was not notified of any missing documentation relevant to the claim. Thus, a remand is warranted.

The Veteran is notified that under the modernized appeal system, remands do not automatically return to the Board for additional adjudication. Should the AOJ deny the claim in whole or in part and the Veteran wish to continue his appeal before the Board, he should file an appropriate VA Form 10182 within the applicable appeal period after the AOJ's readjudication of the claim.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Take any necessary action to ensure all documentation relevant to the determination of the Veteran's eligibility for payment or reimbursement of the non-VA prescriptions.

This includes, but is not limited to, any relevant applications, authorization forms, medical records, and billing records.

2. Then, issue the Veteran a decision and notice of decision as described in 38 U.S.C. § 5104 on the issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of medication expenses associated with non-VA emergency medical treatment on August 3, 2024.

The notice shall include, but is not limited to, a summary of the evidence; a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; identification of findings favorable to the claimant; and identification of the substantive conditions not satisfied but necessary for payment of the cost of medication expenses associated with non-VA emergency medical treatment on August 3, 2024, under 38 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1725, and/or 1728.
