FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement which did not identify an existing rating decision with which the claimant disagrees; and did not file an NOD for the issue of an acquired psychiatric condition within one year from the date that the agency mailed the notice of the decision.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had bilateral shoulder numbness at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had plantar fasciitis at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had arthritis at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

5. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had bilateral flatfeet at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

6. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had sleep apnea at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

7. The Veteran's trochanteric pain syndrome with limitation of flexion of the right thigh is manifested by painful motion.

8. During the appeal period, the Veteran experienced migraines with less frequent attacks. The migraines did not manifest in characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from May 2016 to May 2020.

This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an October 2023 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). Given the date of the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran's appeal is governed by the modernized review system (known by the Board as AMA). 38 C.F.R. § 19.2. 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

DISMISSED

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, an appeal to the Board must be initiated by the filing of a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) in the form prescribed by the Secretary. See also 38 C.F.R. § 20.201. The NOD must be in writing and identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (b)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). Except as provided in the case of simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed NOD with a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b). The Board will construe such arguments in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal, but the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).

In the present case, the Veteran submitted a June 07, 2024, VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal Notice of Disagreement (NOD). Here, the Veteran identified that he wanted to appeal the issues of service connection for an anxiety condition, service connection for an anxiety condition for treatment purposes only, and service connection for mental health (to include depression, anxiety, trouble sleeping, insomnia, panic attacks, and adjustment disorder). Regarding the issue of service connection for mental health, the Veteran identified a December 2023 rating decision; however, no rating decision was issued in December 2023. Further, regarding service connection for an anxiety condition and service connection for an anxiety condition for treatment purposes only, the Veteran identified a December 2021 rating decision. 

Here, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include an anxiety condition, an anxiety condition for treatment purposes only, and mental health are not properly before the Board. In this regard, the Veteran submitted a NOD which failed to identify the specific decision and issues with which he disagrees within one year of the date of the decision. Thus, the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is not properly before the Board and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

SERVICE CONNECTION

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral shoulder numbness

2. Entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis

3. Entitlement to service connection for arthritis

4. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral flatfeet

5. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea

The Veteran asserts he is entitled to service connection for bilateral shoulder numbness, plantar fasciitis, arthritis (specifically of the lower back), bilateral flatfeet, and sleep apnea.

Generally, to establish service connection there must be competent evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the in-service injury incurred or aggravated during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

Service treatment records (STRs) do not contain complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for bilateral shoulder numbness, plantar fasciitis, arthritis, bilateral flatfeet, or sleep apnea. On his March 2020 separation examination, it was noted that the Veteran had normal arches and normal bilateral upper extremities. The Veteran reported ongoing pain with his lower back; however, there was no notation of arthritis of the lower back. The Board notes that the Veteran is already service connected for lumbosacral strain.

VA treatment records do not contain a diagnosis or treatment for bilateral shoulder numbness, plantar fasciitis, arthritis, bilateral flatfeet, or sleep apnea. The Veteran has not identified any outstanding private medical records regarding treatment for the aforementioned conditions.

In the present case, the evidence does not permit the Board to decide the claim in the Veteran's favor. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991) ("The duty to assist is not always a one-way street. If a veteran wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining the putative evidence."). Here, the evidence of record is not sufficient to establish that the Veteran has had a diagnosis of bilateral shoulder numbness, plantar fasciitis, arthritis, bilateral flatfeet, or sleep apnea at any time during the appeal period. Further, review of STRs do not suggest that the Veteran has had any of these conditions, or symptoms of these conditions, during service.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has not received a VA examination for the claimed issues. The duty to assist requires VA to provide an examination when the record contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability, or signs and symptoms of a current disability; the record indicates that the disability (or signs and symptoms of a disability) may be associated with military service; and the record does not contain sufficient information to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006). The only evidence relating the Veteran's claims for service connection for bilateral shoulder numbness, plantar fasciitis, arthritis, bilateral flatfeet, and sleep apnea to his military service are his own statements. This is insufficient to trigger the duty to assist to obtain a VA examination. Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (holding that a claimant's "conclusory generalized statement that his service illness caused his present medical problems" was not sufficient to entitle him to a VA examination). Given the lack of competent evidence relating the Veteran's claims for bilateral shoulder numbness, plantar fasciitis, arthritis, bilateral flatfeet, and sleep apnea to service, the Board finds that a VA examination is not necessary in this case, as there is no indication a disability exists or that the disability may be associated with service.

Accordingly, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for bilateral shoulder numbness, plantar fasciitis, arthritis, bilateral flatfeet, and sleep apnea is not warranted.

In reaching such decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, the persuasive evidence of record is against the Veteran's claims for service connection for bilateral shoulder numbness, plantar fasciitis, arthritis, bilateral flatfeet, and sleep apnea. As such, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and his claims must be denied. 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, supra.

INCREASED RATING

1. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for trochanteric pain syndrome with limitation of flexion of the right thigh

The Veteran is seeking a compensable rating for his service-connected trochanteric pain syndrome with limitation of flexion of the right thigh. 

The Veteran's trochanteric pain syndrome with limitation of flexion of the right thigh is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252, for limitation of flexion of the thigh. Under Diagnostic Code 5252, a 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 20 degrees. A maximum 40 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 10 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252.  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flareups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in November 2021. The Veteran reported symptoms of occasional hip popping with pain shooting down to his knee. He stated that he treats his condition with medication. He further reported that he has a fast-paced job and is unable to move how he needs to due to his condition. He reported flareups that occur 5 to 6 times a day that are moderately severe and last until his hip pops; he stated that flareups are precipitated by being on his feet. The Veteran did not report any functional loss. Initial active range of motion measurements were abnormal with flexion to 110 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, abduction to 45 degrees, adduction to 25 degrees, external rotation to 50 degrees, and internal rotation to 35 degrees. Pain was noted on internal rotation; limitation in adduction did not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs. Passive range of motion testing resulted in flexion to 115 degrees; the remaining range of motion values were the same as active range of motion values with pain exhibited on internal rotation. The limitation in passive adduction did not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs. Pain was exhibited on active movement and passive movement but was not present with weightbearing, non-weightbearing, or on rest/non-movement; the pain did not cause functional loss. The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with at least 3 repetitions and no additional loss of range of motion after 3 repetitions. Procured evidence from the Veteran suggested that pain significantly limits functional ability with repeated use over time and with flareups; range of motion immediately after repeated use over time or a flareup was estimated as flexion to 105 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, abduction to 40 degrees, adduction to 20 degrees, external rotation to 45 degrees, and internal rotation to 30 degrees. Limitation in adduction after repeated use over time or a flareup did not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs. Interference with standing was an additional factor contributing to the Veteran's disability. There was no muscle atrophy and no ankylosis of the hip and/or thigh. There was no malunion or nonunion of the femur, flail hip joint, or leg length discrepancy. The Veteran reported that he does not use any assistive devices as a normal mode of locomotion. The examiner noted that the Veteran's condition impacts his ability to work due to discomfort when moving around and possible locking.  

Here, the Board finds that entitlement to a compensable rating for trochanteric pain syndrome with limitation of flexion of the right thigh is not warranted. In this regard, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the evidence of record does not demonstrate that the Veteran has had flexion of the right thigh limited to 45 degrees or less at any time during the period on appeal. Instead, the evidence shows that, at worst, the Veteran's flexion is limited to 105 degrees with repeated use over time and with flareups. While the Veteran reported painful motion during the November 2021 VA examination, the Veteran is already in receipt of a 10 percent rating for painful motion under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 for trochanteric pain syndrome with impairment of the right thigh which is rated under DC 5253; thus, a second rating for painful motion pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 for the right thigh under DC 5252 would constitute impermissible pyramiding. 

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's appeal for a compensable rating for trochanteric pain syndrome with limitation of flexion of the right thigh. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for migraines including migraine variants

The Veteran is seeking a compensable disability rating for his service-connected migraines.

Migraine headaches are rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100, for migraine. Under DC 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks. A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.  

The rating criteria of DC 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30?Vet. App.?245, 252 (2018). This renders 38?C.F.R. §§?4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable. Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under DC 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation. Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in November 2021. He reported that he currently experiences 2 to 3 migraines a week with sensitivity to light. He reported taking medication to treat his symptoms. It was noted that the Veteran experienced constant head pain, throbbing head pain, and sensitivity to light that lasts less than one day. The examiner determined that the Veteran did not have characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain; and that the Veteran did not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability. It was noted that the Veteran's headache condition impacts his ability to work due to light sensitivity; but he is able to turn off the lights so he can continue working.

Upon reviewing the pertinent evidence of record, the Board finds that entitlement to a compensable rating for migraines is not warranted. In this regard, a compensable rating under DC 8100 is not warranted unless there are migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months. Here, while the Veteran reported migraines with light sensitivity 2 to 3 times per week, the examiner found that the Veteran did not have prostrating attacks and that the migraine/non-migraine pain was not productive of severe economic inadaptability. The Veteran also reported that his migraines interfere with work due to light sensitivity but he is able to turn the lights off and continue working. As such, the Board concludes that the Veteran's migraines did not occur with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months at any time during the appeal period.  

In reaching its conclusions in the instant case, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's belief that his migraine headaches are more severe than as reflected by the current assigned disability rating. In this regard, the Board must consider the entire evidence of record when analyzing the criteria laid out in the rating schedule. While the Board recognizes that the Veteran is competent to describe his symptomatology, he is not competent to provide an opinion regarding the severity of his symptomatology in accordance with the rating criteria. Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007). Ultimately, the Board finds the medical evidence in which professionals with specialized expertise examined the Veteran, acknowledged his reported symptoms, and described the manifestations of such disabilities considering the rating criteria to be more persuasive.

Accordingly, entitlement to a compensable rating for migraines including migraine variants is not warranted.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
