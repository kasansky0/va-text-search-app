FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A June 2019 rating decision, in pertinent part, granted service connection and an initial 10 percent rating for lumbar spine strain, denied a compensable rating for a residual scar of the left shoulder, and denied service connection for headaches, a neck disability, and disabilities of the knees.

2. The Veteran did not initiate review of the June 2019 rating decision as it pertained to the denial of a rating in excess of 10 percent for the lumbar spine strain, the denial of a compensable rating for the left shoulder scar, or the denial of service connection for disabilities of the knees during the one-year period following the mailing of notice of that decision.

3. In a July 2020 VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)), the Veteran expressed a desire to appeal the June 2019 rating decision, to include as it pertained to the denial of a rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbar spine strain, the denial of a compensable rating for the left shoulder scar, and the denial of service connection for disabilities of the knees.

4. A timely NOD as to the June 2019 rating decision with respect to the denial of a rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbar spine strain, a compensable rating for the left shoulder scar, and service connection for disabilities of the knees was not received; the Veteran did not request an extension or provide good cause as to why he did not timely appeal the June 2019 denial of those issues.

5. A July 2019 rating decision denied service connection for a mental health disorder.

6. In April 2020 and May 2020, the Veteran filed supplemental claims (VA Forms 20-0995) seeking review of the prior denials of service connection for headaches, a neck disability, and mental health disorder.

7. On July 18, 2020, while the foregoing supplemental claims were still pending, and without withdrawing the previously filed VA Forms 20-0995, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 seeking Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) review of the same issues.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Veteran's claims are not properly before the Board. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from December 1993 to December 2005. His decorations include the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2019 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. The Veteran filed an appeal to the Board in July 2020, selecting the hearing review option. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(2).

The Board notes that, in addition to the present appeal, other issues are pending before the Board in a separate appeal stream under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). Those issues will be addressed in a separate Board decision, if otherwise in order, in accordance with their place on the Board's docket. 

Dismissal

At the outset, the Board notes that there is an April 2024 VA Form 27-0820 (Report of General Information) of record which indicates that it was at that time the Veteran's desire to withdraw the present appeal, which had been scheduled for a Board hearing that same month. He was invited to submit a written statement of withdrawal, and indicated his intent to do so, but no written statement of withdrawal was ever received as to this particular appeal stream. Consequently, the Board will proceed with consideration of the appeal on other grounds.

Under the AMA framework, a claimant has one year from the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issues a notice of decision on a claim or issue to elect one of the following administrative review options by timely filing the appropriate form prescribed by the Secretary: (1) a request for Higher-Level Review under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601; or (2) an appeal to the Board under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)(1). In addition, a claimant may file a supplemental claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 at any time after VA issues notice of a decision on an issue within a claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)(2).

A claimant who has filed for review of a claim or issue under one of the available options may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). However, a claimant may change the review option selected by withdrawing the request as prescribed in § 3.2500(d) and filing the appropriate application for the requested review option within one year from the date on which VA issued notice of the decision at issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(e). Section 3.2500(b) requires, among other things, that the withdrawal of the initially selected review option be submitted in writing or through electronic submission in a manner prescribed by the Secretary.

An appeal to the Board consists of a properly completed VA Form 10182 (NOD) filed within one year from the date that VA mails the notice of the decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202, 20.203. The date of mailing of the letter of notification of the decision is presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).

Where a VA Form 10182 is not timely filed, the Board may grant an extension of the time to file and accept the form as timely where good cause has been shown. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. Id.

In Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that VA regulations requiring veterans to follow certain procedures in filing appeals do not limit the Board's jurisdiction. Rather, the Court described those regulations as "akin to claims-processing rules" that govern the orderly processing of cases, but do not implicate jurisdiction. Id.at 333.

Here, in a June 2019 rating decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, granted service connection and an initial 10 percent for lumbar spine strain, denied a compensable rating for a residual scar of the left shoulder, and denied service connection for headaches, a neck disability, and disabilities of the knees. The AOJ notified the Veteran of its decision and of his appellate rights later that same month.

Thereafter, the Veteran did not initiate any kind of review, whether to the Board or otherwise, as it pertained to the June 2019 denial of a rating in excess of 10 percent for the lumbar spine strain, the denial of a compensable rating for the left shoulder scar, or the denial of service connection for disabilities of the knees during the one-year period following the mailing of notice of that decision. Rather, he submitted a VA Form 10182 (NOD) addressing those issues in July 2020.

On review, the Board finds that the Veteran's July 2020 NOD was untimely inasmuch as it was filed more than one year after the mailing of notice of the June 2019 rating decision. He did not request an extension of the one-year period for filing an appeal, nor did he provide good cause as to why he did not timely appeal the June 2019 decision. Consequently, the criteria for dismissal of the appeal due to a procedural defect involving a claims-processing rule have been met. Hall, supra; Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (en banc).

Moreover, even if the July NOD was construed as having been timely filed, the Board would nevertheless be constrained to find that the Veteran's claims for service connection for a mental health disorder, headaches, and a neck disability are not properly before the Board. In that regard, the Board notes that, in addition to the issues that were addressed in the June 2019 rating decision, a July 2019 rating decision also denied service connection for a mental health disorder. In April 2020 and May 2020, the Veteran filed supplemental claims (VA Forms 20-0995) seeking review of the prior denials of service connection for headaches, a neck disability, and a mental health disorder. On July 18, 2020, while the foregoing supplemental claims were still pending, and without withdrawing the previously filed VA Forms 20-0995, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 seeking Board review of the same issues.

Because the April 2020 and May 2020 supplemental claims seeking review of the mental health, headache, and neck claims were still pending on July 18, 2020, when the Veteran sought Board review of the same issues, and he did not first withdraw the former review request before filing the latter request, the filing of the latter request violated the prohibition on concurrent elections set out at 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

For all of the foregoing, the Board finds that the issues identified in the Veteran's July 2020 VA Form 10182 are not properly before the Board in the present appeal stream. His attempted appeal of those issues to the Board is dismissed as inconsistent with governing claims processing rules.
