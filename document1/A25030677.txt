DOCKET NO. 240108-407305
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of a January 2024 proposal to retroactively adjust Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation payments due to military drill payments is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The January 2024 notification letter proposing to retroactively adjust VA compensation benefits for Fiscal Year 2023 drill or training days was not a final decision.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal based on the lack of an appealable decision have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 2015 to July 2021, with service in the Persian Gulf War, and with additional periods of service in the National Guard.

REFERRED

The issue of waiver of recovery of an overpayment in the amount of $320.78 for FY 2022 drill pay was raised in a December 21, 2023 Supplemental Claim in response to July 17, 2023 Demand Letter, and is referred to the Debt Management Center, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) for adjudication.

1. The appeal of a January 2024 proposal to retroactively adjust Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation payments due to military drill payments is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

In January 2024, the Veteran was informed that VA planned to retroactively adjust his compensation benefits based on 2 drill or training pay days received in FY 2023.  The letter also stated that if the proposed adjustment becomes final, it will result in an overpayment.  

In January 2024, the Veteran attempted to appeal the proposed action in the January 2024 notification letter.  

The Board observes that the proposal to retroactively adjust VA compensation pay due to military drill pay is not an appealable issue as it is merely a proposed action, not a final adverse decision.  Thus, the January 2024 appeal was premature, and was erroneously docketed.  In other words, the January 2024 letter did not constitute a final decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) and the Veteran's January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) did not place the issue in appellate status.
