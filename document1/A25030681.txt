DOCKET NO. 210618-265254
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical expenses for emergency treatment provided on April 17, 2018, has been withdrawn.

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2002 to July 2006.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2020 determination letter of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Veteran appealed this decision under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) with the timely submission of a June 2021 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement).  She elected the Hearing Lane, under which the applicable review period is the time period before the rating decision in question and 90 days after the Board hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

It is noted that a hearing was previously scheduled for the Veteran in April 2025. However, in a signed and dated correspondence from the Veteran in March 2025, such hearing request was withdrawn.  As such withdrawal was knowingly made, the Board finds that it is valid and that adjudication would be able to proceed accordingly.

In the March 2025 correspondence, the Veteran additionally confirmed her desire to withdraw her appeal.  This request was made in writing and signed, clearly evidencing an intent to withdraw the appeal, citing that the issue had already been resolved several years earlier.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran expressed a clear and unambiguous intent to withdraw this appeal; therefore, all requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 have been met.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal of the September 2020 determination letter concerning the claim for entitlement to payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical expenses for emergency treatment provided on April 17, 2018.

The appeal is dismissed.
