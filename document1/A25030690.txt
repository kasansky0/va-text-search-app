ORDER

An effective date of October 8, 2011 for the award of service connection for left knee disability is granted. 

Entitlement to an initial rating higher than 10 percent for left knee disability from April 5, 2021, is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. October 8, 2011 is the earliest date a claim for service connection for left knee disability was received.

2. The evidence is in approximate balance to find that his left knee disability manifested prior to October 8, 2011.

3. From April 5, 2021, the Veteran's left knee disability is not manifested by flexion limited to 30 degrees or less.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of October 8, 2011 for the grant of service connection for left knee disability are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114, 3.151, 3.155, 3.400. 

2. From April 5, 2021, the criteria for an initial rating higher than 10 percent for left knee disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1996 to August 1999 and from May 2003 to October 2009. 

In May 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2021 decision.  In November 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2021 decision.

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the June 2021 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. An effective date of October 8, 2011 for the award of service connection for left knee disability is granted.  

The Veteran is seeking an effective date earlier than April 5, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee disability.

In general, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection, shall be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

In this case, the Veteran asserts that the appropriate effective date for the grant of service connection for left knee disability, should be October 8, 2011 because the claim has been pending since that time. See October 2023 Notice of Disagreement. As explained below, the Board agrees.

Review of the claims file shows that the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for bilateral knee disability on October 8, 2011.  An examination related to his claimed bilateral knee disability was requested in October 2011. However, a November 2011 Report of General Information from a Veterans Service Representative (VSR) at the Seattle Regional Office states, "Talked to Dale Sullivan at C&P [Compensation and Pension] Services at Seattle VAMC. Vet is withdrawing claim for knees...because his private doctors cannot find any arthritis in those areas." The Veteran was sent a notification in December 2011 indicating that his claim for service connection for bilateral knees was withdrawn. The notification letter explained that the Veteran had one year from the date of the letter to refile his claim to retain the effective date of his October 2011 claim. The Veteran did not respond.  

In this case, the November 2011 Report of General Information reflects that the "withdrawal" of claim was submitted by someone at Compensation & Pension services at Seattle VAMC. At the time of the November 2011 Report of General Information, the Veteran was represented by Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW). The name "Dale Sullivan" is not on the VA Form 21-22 appointing VFW as his representative, nor is it on any correspondence during the relevant time period. It appears he may have been a VA employee at C&P Services which provided VA examinations. While it is unclear from the record who Dale Sullivan was in relation to the Veteran, he does not appear to have been the Veteran's authorized representative. In short, a phone call to the AOJ from an individual who was neither the Veteran nor his representative was the basis of the withdrawal.

In November 2011, there was no statute or regulation which allowed someone other than the claimant or his representative to withdraw a claim. Thus, the Board finds the AOJ improperly relied on communication from someone other than the claimant or his representative to close the claim. As such, the Board agrees with the Veteran's representative that the claim has been pending since October 8, 2011.  Therefore, the remaining question is when entitlement arose. 

In November 2011, the Veteran reported that he had throbbing and swelling in his knees and that they gave out, causing him to fall three times in the six months prior to his statement. Additionally, VA treatment records from August 2012 reflect that he reported knee pain. See August 2012 Caregiver Program Support Note. Although the Veteran was diagnosed with the service-connected left knee strain in June 2021, his report of pain and giving out in the six months prior to November 2011 indicates that his disability likely first manifested in the summer of 2011. Taylor v. Collins, No. 24-5043, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 240, at *1 (Vet. App. Feb. 26, 2025) (finding "when assigning an effective date based on when entitlement arose, the Board may not mechanically assign the date of an exam but must determine when the disability first manifested.") 

Reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the Veteran and affording him the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds the evidence is in approximate balance to find that his left knee disability manifested before the October 8, 2011 date of claim. Accordingly, the Board finds that October 8, 2011, the later of the two dates, is the appropriate effective date of grant of service connection for left knee disability.  

2. Entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for left knee disability is denied. 

The June 2021 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for left knee strain and assigned an initial 10 percent rating under DC 5260 from April 5, 2021. The Veteran is seeking a higher initial rating for his left knee disability. Given the grant of an earlier effective date for service connection of the left knee strain in this decision, the AOJ will assign an initial rating for the period from October 8, 2011 to April 4, 2021.

Thus, the appeal period for a higher initial rating for the left knee in this appeal starts on April 5, 2021, as this is the only rating that has been assigned by the AOJ and appealed to the Board. The evidence window ends on the date of the June 2021 rating decision.

The VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities is used to determine disability once a disability is service connected. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 ;38 C.F.R. § 4.1. In the Rating Schedule, DCs are assigned to specific disabilities. These DCs designate percentage ratings based on the average functional impairment of the Veteran due to a service-connected disability.38 C.F.R. § 4.10. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

Under DC 5260, a 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 15 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260.

In this case, the competent and persuasive evidence of record weighs against an assignment of rating higher than 10 percent during the appeal period. 

To that end, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in June 2021, where he reported having left knee pain that limits his ability to bend, walk, run, climb stairs, lift, squat or stand for a long period of time. The Veteran's initial range of flexion was limited to 130 degrees, which was unchanged after repetitive use testing. His range of motion was the same during active and passive motion. The Veteran reported flare-ups that occur once or twice a week. The examiner predicted that the Veteran's range of motion would reduce to 110 degrees during flare-ups. The examiner noted that during flare-ups the Veteran's pain was alleviated by rest and medication. The examiner assessed the flare-ups as mild, stating they were precipitated by overuse and lasted less than one day. During flare-ups the Veteran reported functional loss to the extent that his left knee pain causes difficulty bending, walking, running, climbing up and down stairs, lifting, squatting or with prolonged standing. 

Thus, the Veteran's range of flexion is far greater than the 30 degrees contemplated under a 20 percent rating, even during flare-ups. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and functional loss due to pain, and that ibuprofen along with rest ameliorated his pain during flare-ups. The Board has considered whether, without the ameliorating effects of ibuprofen, the left knee strain symptoms would warrant in a higher rating. See Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (Vet. App. Mar. 12, 2025). However, the examiner assessed the flare-ups as mild and neither the Veteran nor his representative have contended that his unmedicated pain would result in an additional 80 degrees of limitation of flexion (from the estimated reduced flexion of 110 degrees during flare-ups). The medical treatment records dated during the appeal period do not reflect any assessments or treatment for the left knee, or prescription of ibuprofen. This indicates the Veteran was not using prescription-strength dosage levels for his knee pain. Therefore, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and functional loss, and ameliorating effects of ibuprofen used during mild flare-ups, the degree of limitation of motion reflected by the statements and the evaluation would not reasonably result in flexion limited to 30 degrees.

Thus, a rating higher than 10 percent is not warranted under DC 5260.

The Board has considered whether a separate or higher rating is warranted under the other DCs pertaining to the knee and leg. However, neither the June 2021 examination report nor the treatment records during the appeal period reflects ankylosis, recurrent subluxation or instability, impairment related to semilunar cartilage, limitation of extension, impairment of the tibia and fibula, or genu recurvatum to warrant a separate rating under DCs 5256, 5257, 5258, 5259, 5261, and 5262, respectively.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating higher than 10 percent for left knee disability from April 5, 2021. The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. The claim is denied.
