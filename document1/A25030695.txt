DOCKET NO. 211116-197893
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a statement received in February 2025, prior to a decision being promulgated on the current docket, the Veteran indicated his desire to withdraw the pending appeal before the Board.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the pending appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 2010 to January 2011.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2020 rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO).  In a November 2021 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran elected the hearing review docket. The Veteran was scheduled for a Board hearing on April 30, 2025, which has since been canceled.

The claimant or the claimant's representative may withdraw an appeal as to any or all issues on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204(a). Except for appeals withdrawn on the record at a hearing, withdrawal must be in writing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204(b)(1). A withdrawal is effective when received provided that receipt is prior to the issuance of a decision by the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204(b)(3). A written withdrawal request is effective where it includes (i) the name of the appellant, (ii) the file number, and (iii) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204(b). Withdrawal of a claim constitutes a withdrawal of the NOD and, if filed, the Substantive Appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204(c). There is no obligation to proceed with further adjudication following withdrawal. Hanson v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 29 (1996).

Here, in a February 2025 communication, the Veteran indicated that he wanted to withdraw from appeal his claim regarding the propriety of withholding VA disability compensation due to fugitive status. Specifically, the Veteran reported that the "situation has been resolved" and he no longer wished to continue his appeal. The communication contained the Veteran's name and file number, as well. The withdrawal effectively meets the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.204. When a pending appeal is withdrawn, there is no longer an allegation of error of fact or law with respect to the determination that had been previously appealed. Consequently, dismissal of the pending appeal is the appropriate disposition. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).
