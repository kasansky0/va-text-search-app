REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran has active service from May 1992 to September 1992 with additional National Guard service.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the January 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the sinusitis claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is remanding the sinusitis claim for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of those claims.

The Board notes that the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been received and readjudicated the Veteran's claim in a January 2021 rating decision. The determination that new and relevant evidence has been received is a finding favorable to the claimant and is binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801(a).

1. Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR RO 

ADJUDICATOR:

This claim is being remanded due to a pre-decisional duty to assist error. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Appellants are entitled to a hearing at the AOJ before VA issues a decision on an initial or supplemental claim pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103 (d)(1) and 3.103(b)(1). Notice of this right to a hearing must be provided to the Veteran and the representative. This is to correct an error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty.

THE REMAND DIRECTIVES FOLLOW

1. Provide the Veteran and the representative notice of the right to participate in a pre-decisional RO hearing and allow a reasonable period to respond/request the hearing prior to readjudicating the claim.

2. Readjudicate.
