DOCKET NO. 201023-116990
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal seeking an initial disability rating in excess of 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with an alcohol use disorder is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In September 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal seeking an initial disability rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD with an alcohol use disorder are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on active duty from November 1986 to October 1990.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a September 2020 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), of which the Veteran was notified in October 2020 (hereinafter referred to as "October 2020 rating decision").  In the October 2020 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for PTSD with an alcohol use disorder and assigned an initial disability rating of 70 percent, effective January 11, 2017.

In October 2020, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) and requested a hearing before the Board regarding the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for PTSD with alcohol use disorder.  A Board hearing was scheduled for October 2024.  However, as discussed below, the Veteran withdrew his appeal, to include the hearing request, in September 2024.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2020 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the RO issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  In Hembree v. Wilkie, the United States Court of Appeals for of Veterans Claims held that written withdrawals of an appeal are governed by the applicable regulations instead of DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011) (requiring a withdrawal to be explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences).  See 33 Vet. App. 1,7 (2020).  As this case is governed by the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the applicable regulation is 38 C.F.R. § 20.205, which requires that the withdrawal includes the name of the appellant and the file number.  Additionally, the veteran or representative must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(c), withdrawal of an appeal will be deemed a withdrawal of the Notice of Disagreement as to all issues to which the withdrawal applies.

Here, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, requested withdrawal of the instant appeal before the Board in September 2024.  See September 2024 "Third Party Correspondence"; September 2024 VA Form 27-0820.  The written withdrawals included the Veteran's name, file number, and Board docket number, and asked that the appeal be withdrawn in its entirety.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's written withdrawals of the appeal are valid.

As there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration regarding this claim, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
