ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric condition, to include depression is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his prostate cancer is at least as likely as not related to his in-service exposure to the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric condition, to include depression have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Marine Corps from September 1984 to November 1988. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer

The Veteran contends that his prostate cancer is due to his in-service exposure to the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune (CLCW). 

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that is related to his in-service exposure to CLCW. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Here, the November 2023 rating decision found that the Veteran had a current diagnosis of prostate cancer and conceded in-service exposure to CLCW. Thus, the question becomes whether the current disability is related to service. On this question there are probative opinions in favor of and against the claim.

The evidence against the claim includes an October 2023 VA examination and addendum opinion. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's prostate cancer was less likely than not related to his CLCW exposure. The rationale was, "This [V]eteran developed prostate cancer in 2020. He was exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune but this exposure is not known or recognized as causing prostate cancer. In addition there is no other valid medical literature or science that shows beyond doubt that such toxic exposure causes prostate cancer." See October 2023 Addendum Opinion. 

However, the Board finds this rationale to be too conclusory as it does not adequately explain how the Veteran's condition is unrelated to his CLCW exposure. "[A] medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two." Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet.App. 295, 301 (2008) (noting that an opinion is not "entitled to any weight in a service connection or rating context if it contains only data and conclusions"); see also McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet.App. 15, 31 (2016) (finding that the Board erred in relying on an opinion where the examiner "did not provide a clear rationale for her opinion or consider relevant evidence in formulating her opinion"). As such, this rationale is inadequate. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A] medical opinion must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions"). Therefore, the Board assigns this opinion little probative weight.

The evidence in favor of the claim includes a December 2022 opinion from a private physician. The private physician opined that the Veteran's prostate cancer is as likely as not due to his in-service CLCW exposure. The rationale was:

The medical literature shows that exposure to [trichloroethylene (TCE)] and [perchloroethylene (PCE)] is a substantial risk factor for the development of prostate cancer. And, given that the veteran has no other risk factors or exposures to carcinogens other than the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, it is my opinion with the highest degree of medical certainty, that his prostate cancer is at least as likely as not a result of his prolonged exposure to TCE and PCE found in the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.

See August 2022 Private Opinion. The private physician's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current prostate cancer is related to his service. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for prostate cancer is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric condition, to include depression

The Veteran contends that his acquired psychiatric condition is secondary to his now service-connected prostate cancer.  

The September 2023 VA examination shows the Veteran has a current disability of adjustment disorder with chronic depressed mood, and the September 2023 VA examiner opined that it is at least as likely as not proximately due to the now service-connected prostate cancer. The rationale was: 

The [V]eteran's symptoms presented after his prostate cancer diagnosis related to the physical symptoms associated with his medical condition (i.e., inability to perform sexually, incontinence, etc.). The symptoms associated with his medical symptoms have led to mild symptoms of depression. The rationale is based on a clinical interview with the veteran, onset and progression of symptoms, review of medical records, as well as consultation with the DSM-V. 

See September 2023 VA examination. The VA examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304. There is no opinion of record to the contrary.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence indicates that the Veteran's current adjustment disorder with chronic depressed mood is due to his now service-connected prostate cancer. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for acquired psychiatric condition is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

3. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction

The Veteran contends that his erectile dysfunction is secondary to his now service-connected prostate cancer. 

The September 2023 VA examination shows the Veteran has a current disability of erectile dysfunction, and the VA examiner opined that it is at least as likely as not the result of the service-connected prostate cancer. The rationale was: 

The veteran was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had prostatectomy. He developed [erectile dysfunction (ED)] as a result of the prostatectomy for cancer. This ED developed right after the surgery, and this surgery is known to have ED as a possible complication. The claimed condition is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service connected condition.
