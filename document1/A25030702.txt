DOCKET NO. 250203-514199
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder, claimed as mental health issue, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 7, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1998 to August 1999.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). In February 2025, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), in which she elected the Direct Review docket. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

Withdrawal and Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.

Here, in March 2025, the Veteran submitted a written statement in which she expressed her explicit intent to withdraw her Board appeal as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder. Specifically, the Veteran stated, "I would like to withdraw the 10182 submitted on 3 Feb 2024. I will submit a supplemental claim instead." VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim, received March 7, 2025. The Veteran's request was made prior to the promulgation of a Board decision and evinced the Veteran's clear intent to withdraw her appeal from Board consideration as well as her understanding of the ramifications of that decision. See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020); Martinez v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 320 (2023); see also Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Consequently, there are no allegations of error of fact or law remaining for appellate consideration as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder. As such, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal at this time and the claim is dismissed.
