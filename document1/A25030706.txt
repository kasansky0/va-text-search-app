ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for flat feet is dismissed. 

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

On August 28, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant, through the authorized representative, that a withdrawal of the appeal regarding the claim of service connection for flat feet and tinnitus is requested.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal of the claim of service connection for flat feet and tinnitus by the appellant's authorized representative are met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1994 to May 1997. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO)'s supplemental claim rating decision issued in June 2024. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. In the present case, the appellant's authorized representative has withdrawn, in writing, the appeal of the issues of service connection for flat feet and tinnitus for which a supplemental claim was submitted in May 2024 and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction and it is dismissed.
