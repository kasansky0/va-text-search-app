ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

1. The evidence of record does not clearly and unmistakably show that the Veteran's left knee disability pre-existed service.

2.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his left knee disability is related to the February 1970 fall he sustained while in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a left knee disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from January to March 1970.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R.  § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran has the right to select a different Board review option by submitting a new VA Form 10182 within one year from the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever date is later.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); see Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  Although the period to change dockets per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has not elapsed, the issue is being granted in full, and therefore, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding to adjudicate the appeal. 

The Board notes that while the April 2024 supplemental claim rating decision did not include a specific finding of new and relevant evidence, the RO adjudicated the matter on the merits; therefore, the Board concludes that such readjudication was an?implicit?finding of?new and relevant evidence by the AOJ.  As the?Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings, new and relevant evidence need not be addressed, and the Board may proceed with addressing the issue of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability.  See 38?C.F.R. §?3.2501.

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is granted.  

The Veteran contends his left knee disability resulted from a fall he sustained during his military service.  See December 2023 VA Form 20-0995 Decision Review Request:  Supplemental Claim and the accompanying December 2023 VA Form 21-4138.  The Veteran asserts he was an active youth, performing chores on his family's farm and participating in high-school sports, and did not have knee or other injuries before entering the service, such that a statement attributed to him in the Medical Board Report is incorrect; he states that he instead injured his knee while running up a barracks stairwell during training.  See December 2023 VA Form 21-4138.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  A successful claim for service connection requires evidence of:  (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

VA shall consider all information and medical and lay evidence of record.  Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). 

The April 2024 rating decision included favorable findings, which are binding on VA in the absence of clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  In addition to the implicit finding that new and relevant evidence had been presented, the AOJ issued the favorable finding that the Veteran had been diagnosed with two disabilities:  (1) left knee joint osteoarthritis and (2) osteochondritis dissecans status post-surgery.  See April 2024 rating decision.  Next, the AOJ found that the Veteran's Service Treatment Record included an entry from February 1970 documenting that the Veteran sought treatment for a left knee injury.  These favorable findings satisfy the first two elements of service connection, a current disability and an in-service injury.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d at 1166-67. 

The presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury not noted upon entry to service manifests in service, and a question arises as to whether it preexisted service.  Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 55 (2012), aff'd 749 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  In this case, there is a question as to whether the claimed left knee disability preexisted the Veteran's military service from January to March 1970.  

Although the record contains evidence of a pre-service left knee injury, it also contains evidence against a finding that the Veteran injured his left knee before enlisting in the Marine Corps.  

First, the Veteran asserts that he was an active youth, who worked on his family's farm and who played high school football and ran track and cross-country.  See VA Forms 21-4138, dated March 2023 and December 2023; see also Form 21-4138 dated October 2022.  He refutes making the statement, reflected in his medical discharge proceedings, that he injured his left knee at age 12.  

To corroborate his claims, he has presented multiple statements from relatives and long-term friends from his high school years to refute any claim of pre-service injury, citing their personal recollection of him being healthy, not having injuries, working on the farm, participating in high-impact sports, and the likelihood that in the small town of their childhood, everyone would soon know if anyone had an injury or illness of any kind.  See VA Forms 21-4138, providing statements from the Veteran's sisters, J.N.G., H.U.W., and W.H and friends A.G. and J.L.B.  The Veteran also submitted photocopies from his high-school yearbook documenting his participation in track and field, along with publicly-available information about scholastic sports, including a medical examination requirement. 

Finally, the Veteran's STRs reflect his report that he injured his left knee when running two days earlier.  See February 11, 1970, STR entry.  The medical provider ordered an x-ray.  See id.          

The Veteran's military personnel records include the report of the Medical Board issued shortly after the February 1970 STR entry.  See STR, Medical Board Report (MBR), dated February 17, 1970.  After obtaining x-rays, the Medical Board diagnosed the Veteran with osteochondritis dissecans, left knee, and with a loose body, also in the left knee.  The Medical Board checked the box to find the Veteran not physically qualified for duty (NPQ), and recommended discharge, on the basis of erroneous induction into service.  The Medical Board also checked the boxes for permanent conditions that existed prior to entry and were not aggravated by service.  See MBR.   

The MBR also includes a statement, purportedly from the Veteran, that he had experienced pain, grating, and locking of his left knee since age 12.  The statement continues, saying the symptoms appeared infrequently, he did not seek medical attention, and that he was currently experiencing increased pain and grating in his left knee while in service.  The examination noted its medical findings, particularly painful limitation of motion past 135 degrees' flexion and locking occasionally on forced extension.    

There is also some ambiguity in the Veteran's entrance examinations conducted for his enlistment.  On Form DD 47, dated August 1969, the Veteran is noted as having claimed a weak knee and unstable equilibrium.  The examiner notes that these are unverified claims.  See August 1969 DD 47, included in the Veteran's military personnel record.  After physical inspection of the Veteran, the examiner nonetheless finds the Veteran qualified for induction in January 1970.  See id.  Another induction examination, conducted on September 4, 1969, however, notes no defects and lists only a penicillin allergy before finding the Veteran qualified for induction.  See September 4, 1969, Report of Medical Examination.     

Therefore, with respect to the Veteran's left knee disability, the presumption of soundness attaches.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).  Because the presumption of soundness attaches with respect to this disability, there must be clear and unmistakable evidence that the disorder both pre-existed service and was not aggravated in service.  See id.

Clear and unmistakable evidence is defined as obvious or manifest.  38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b).  Clear and unmistakable evidence means that the evidence cannot be misinterpreted and misunderstood, i.e., it is undebatable.  Quirin v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 390, 396 (2009) (internal quotations omitted).  

The most competent and credible evidence of record illustrates that the Veteran's left knee disability did not clearly and unmistakably preexist service.  

The Veteran has provided several statements from siblings and friends who lived with or knew him during his formative years.  Evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of the facts or circumstances involved and conveys matters that can be observed by a lay person.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  Each sister explains where in the birth order she falls in relation to the Veteran; that they lived together and grew up on a farm, where they performed chores; and that no one recalled instances of the Veteran having any illnesses or diagnoses other than typical childhood ailments, such as chicken pox.  See statements from J.N.G., H.U.W., and W.H; see statements from friends and teammates A.G. and J.L.B.  The Board finds these statements competent.  The Board also finds these statements from friends and family members credible and assigns them great probative weight, as there are multiple and do not conflict with each other.  The Veteran's own statements that he grew up on the family farm and participated in sports such as track corroborates these accounts of his youthful health.  Furthermore, he submitted copies of yearbook photos, where he and friend J.L.B. are shown as being teammates on the track team.  

The only evidence asserting a pre-existing condition is the Medical Board's report relaying a knee condition beginning at age 12.  The Veteran's own statement in the STRs does not mention a pre-existing condition.  See STR entry from Feb. 1970.    

Further, contrary to the opinion of the Medical Board, Dr. S.G.B. explained that if the Veteran had had osteochondritis dissecans when entering service, it would have been observed and likely diagnosed during his youth, since it presents during high-impact activities.  Given the Veteran's reports of participating in high-school track and football, it would have been unlikely for his condition not to have been observed and diagnosed.  See October 2023 medical opinion of S.G.B., M.D.  

Therefore, the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted.  When VA fails to carry its burden as to either preexistence or lack of aggravation, whether and to what extent the Veteran is entitled to compensation for the injury would be determined upon the assumption that the injury was incurred during service.  It does not necessarily follow, however, that an unrebutted presumption of soundness will lead to service connection for the disease or injury.  The Veteran must still demonstrate a current disability and a nexus between the current disability and the injury or disease in service.  Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 236-237 (2012).  

The Board will now address the third element of service connection, a nexus.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d at 1166-67.  

VA provided the Veteran with an in-person examination of his left knee in June 2023.  The nurse practitioner confirmed having reviewed the Veteran's e-folder.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with left knee joint osteoarthritis and osteochondritis dissecans status post-surgery.  See June 2023 VA Knee and Lower Leg Conditions DBQ.  The examiner documented the Veteran's report of onset:  during boot camp, his left knee locked before giving out while he was ascending a flight of stairs.  After spending weeks in sick bay, he was discharged.  In 1973, his knee gave out again, resulting in surgery.  See June 2023 VA Knee DBQ.  

The examiner opined that the Veteran's left knee disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by an in-service injury or event.  The examiner relied on the Medical Board Report statement that the Veteran injured his knee as a twelve-year- old and states that considering the seriousness of the 1973 treatment (that is, surgery), it was more likely than not that the condition developed during childhood and was not related to the Veteran's February 1970 STR complaint of knee pain.  

The duty to assist includes obtaining an adequate VA examination.  Once VA has provided a VA examination, it is required to provide an adequate one, regardless of whether it was legally obligated to provide an examination in the first place.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).  The examiner does not consider either the Veteran's own statement that he did not have any childhood knee injuries or any of the other lay statements contradicting the Medical Board Report.  As such, the Board finds this opinion inadequate.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020) (reaffirming the general principle that examiners must address lay evidence in rendering their opinions); see Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39-40 (2007) (an examiner cannot ignore an appellant's statement of injury onset to conclude that there is no relationship between the appellant's current disability and his military service.)

The Veteran submitted a medical opinion from his private treatment provider, along with medical records for his knee.  A Board-certified orthopedic surgeon with background in orthopedic sports medicine, the orthopedist confirms she has read the Veteran's medical records from service and afterward, as well as the submitted statements from the Veteran's family and friends.  See October 2023 medical opinion of S.G.B., M.D.  She diagnosed the Veteran with posttraumatic arthritis in the left knee and primary osteoarthritis in the left knee.  She notes the Veteran's medical history of sustaining a fall in a barracks stairwell in February 1970, adding the detail that the Veteran had only been in the second week of his service at that point.  See id.  She opines that the Veteran's current left knee disability is at least as likely as not related to the fall he experienced in the barracks stairwell in February 1970.  She cites both her professional experience and the state of medical literature to say that traumatic injuries can precipitate arthritic changes to the knee, such as the Veteran experienced.    

The Board finds this opinion adequate and entitled to substantial probative weight.  It considers the relevant lay and medical evidence, while presenting an informed professional analysis.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (an adequate medical opinion supports its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions.)

The Board must resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue that is material to the determination of a matter.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Thus, entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.
