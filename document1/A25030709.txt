REMANDED

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for beneficiary travel expenses associated with travel to a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility on July 9, 2024, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served honorably on active duty from September 1966 to August 1968. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 determination by the VA Veterans Health Administration (VHA). 

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to payment or reimbursement for beneficiary travel expenses associated with travel to a non-VA facility on July 9, 2024, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that under the modernized system, appellants generally have a year to request to change dockets. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). Here, the Veteran selected the Evidence Submission docket and submitted evidence in support of his appeal. Therefore, a docket switch is precluded under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). Moreover, as his appeal has been advanced on the docket, the Board is obligated to address his claims in a timely manner.

1. Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for beneficiary travel expenses associated with travel to a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility on July 9, 2024, is remanded.

A review of the record shows that a remand is needed before the issue on appeal can be adjudicated.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to roundtrip reimbursement for beneficiary travel expenses incurred as a result of his visit to GI Associates Wausau Clinic (GI Associates), on July 9, 2024. He contends that he was seen at GI Associates on July 9, 2024, for a colonoscopy examination which had been previously authorized by VA. See October 11, 2024, VA Form 10182. 

Generally, VA beneficiary travel is a payment for travel expenses incurred in the United States to help Veterans and other persons obtain care or services from the Veterans Health Administration. 38 U.S.C. § 111; 38 C.F.R. § 70.10(a).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 70.4, VA will approve payment for beneficiary travel if:

(1) The travel was made to obtain care of services for a person who is eligible for beneficiary travel payments under § 70.10;

(2) The travel was in conjunction with care or services for which such person was eligible under the laws administered by VA;

(3) Application was made in accordance with § 70.20;

(4) All the requirements of this part for payment are made; and

(5) Any failure to obtain the care or services was due to actions by officials of VA or persons acting on behalf of VA.

The Veteran has basic eligibility for beneficiary travel pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 70.10(a)(2) because he has at least one service-connected disability rated at least 30 percent disabling. He is rated at 30 percent for bilateral hearing loss.

However, a review of the file shows there may be substantive outstanding records. Specifically, the Board cannot discern from the current record whether the treatment from GI Associates is considered a VA authorized health care facility. Under 38 C.F.R. § 70.2, a VA-authorized health care facility is defined as a non-VA health care facility where VA has approved care for an eligible beneficiary at VA expense.

The most recent VA treatment records in the file range through December 2023. These VA treatment records illustrate that the Veteran has a history of colon polyps and diverticulosis and was due for a colonoscopy in 2024. Notably, there are no VA treatment records, including any record of Community Care consultations, for 2024, located in the file. 

An Appointment Attendance Verification note from GI Associates reflects that the Veteran attended an appointment on July 9, 2024, for a colonoscopy exam, and provided a VA authorization number: VA 00322327822. 

The September 2024 denial explicitly stated that "[t]he care or services appointment(s) associated with your date of travel does not qualify for payment.  For travel payment, the appointment must be for VA care or services at an approved designated VA or non-VA healthcare facility and the appointment must be completed unless due to actions by VA or persons acting on behalf of VA.  Authority 38 CFR 70.4 (1)-(2), (5)." As referenced above, the evidence shows that the Veteran did attend the appointment, and he contends that he received prior authorization for his care and appointment at GI Associates. 

The Board acknowledges the Missing Documentation memorandum that was included in the VHA file, stating that as of December 2024, VHA was missing "proof of authorization for date of service July 09, 2024[.]" However, the memo did not reference the specific authorization number provided by the Veteran and his non-VA provider for the appointment on July 9, 2024. Therefore, it is unclear whether the Veteran had an appointment at a VA authorized healthcare facility on that date in question. 

As the record shows ongoing treatment for the Veteran's colon conditions, and that a colonoscopy was due to be performed in 2024, as well as his contentions that he received prior authorization from VA to obtain GI services from a Community Care provider, the AOJ should have made additional efforts to secure medical treatment records (including VA treatment records from 2024), telephone notes, and any other substantive documents to show whether he did have prior authorization for the July 9, 2024, appointment. Therefore, the Board finds that pre-decisional duty to assist errors were committed and a remand is required in an effort to obtain these records.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. The AOJ should ensure all documentation relevant to the determination of the Veteran's eligibility for payment or reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses is associated with the electronic claims file. This includes, but is not limited to, any relevant applications, authorization forms, relevant communication, and medical documentation concerning prior VA authorization for the services at GI Associates for which the Veteran undertook travel on July 9, 2024.

2. The AOJ is encouraged to review the VA medical records provided by the Veteran on October 11, 2024, along with his VA Form 10182 to get the appropriate contact information for GI Associates and to contact them, as appropriate, in order to get any information regarding whether VA authorization and/or referral was provided to the Veteran for the July 9, 2024, appointment.
