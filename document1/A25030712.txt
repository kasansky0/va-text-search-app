DOCKET NO. 240902-470527
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for cause of death is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's military service included at least 30 days stationed at Camp Lejeune between August 1953 and December 1987.

2. The Veteran's death was the result of angioblastic T-cell lymphoma, a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for cause of death have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1168, 1310, 1710 (e)(4); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.312.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty military service from October 1956 to October 1958. He died in January 2023. The Appellant is his surviving spouse.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal of a rating decision issued in April 2024 which denied service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death. In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held in December 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Appellant or her representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for cause of death 

The Appellant has filed a claim of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death. The Veteran's death certificate lists the immediate cause of his death as angioblastic T-cell lymphoma. The record shows that the Veteran was stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, during the period between October 1953 and December 1987.

In order to establish service connection for the cause of the veteran's death, the evidence of record must show that a disability incurred in or aggravated by service either caused or contributed substantially or materially to death. 38 U.S.C. § 1310; 38 C.F.R. § 3.312 (a).

Certain diseases have been associated with exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(7). For the purposes of this section, contaminants in the water supply means the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), benzene and vinyl chloride, that were in the on-base water-supply systems located at United States Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, during the period beginning on August 1, 1953, and ending December 31, 1987.

A veteran, or former reservist or member of the National Guard, who had no less than 30 days (consecutive or nonconsecutive) of service at Camp Lejeune during the period beginning on August 1, 1953, and ending on December 31, 1987, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to the contaminants in the water supply, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the individual was not exposed to contaminants in the water supply during that service. Service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for diseases associated with exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune as enumerated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(f).  The specific diseases covered by this presumption include: (1) kidney cancer, (2) liver cancer, (3) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, (4) adult leukemia, (5) multiple myeloma, (6) Parkinson's disease, (7) aplastic anemia and other myelodysplastic syndromes, and (8) bladder cancer. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (f). These diseases listed in 3.309(f) shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after service.

A medical opinion regarding the Veteran's cause of death was obtained in March 2024. (See C&P Exam, 03/29/2024.) The medical provider offered the opinion that the Veteran's cause of death, angioblastic T-cell lymphoma, as well as contributing factors of hypercalcemia and acute renal failure, were not attributable to his service, to include toxic exposure in service. However, the opinion also clearly states that "angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a rare and aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by the proliferation of abnormal T-cells within lymph nodes and other organs." It appears that the medical provider did not recognize that as a form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the Veteran's specific type of cancer is included within the presumptive conditions for exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.

Inasmuch as the Veteran is shown to have had service for at least 30 days at Camp Lejeune, he is presumed to have been exposed to the contaminated water there. He died of a "rare and aggressive type" of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a disability covered by the presumption set forth by statute. Therefore, the claim of service connection for the cause of death must be granted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1168, 1310; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309, 3.312 (a).
