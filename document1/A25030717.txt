REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for right elbow disability, secondary to service-connected left elbow disability, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1998 until his honorable discharge in November 2002.

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for right elbow disability most recently addressed previously in a December 2021 rating decision.  In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. 

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a March 2024 decision.  In July 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2024 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 decision. In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claims of [list claims], any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for right elbow disability, secondary to service-connected left elbow disability

The Veteran alleges that his right elbow disability is related to his service-connected left elbow disability. The Veteran specifically alleges that due to his left elbow disability, the overuse of the right elbow led to the right elbow disability. 

Once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination in connection with a service-connection claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide an adequate one, or at a minimum, notify the claimant why one will not or cannot be provided. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). A medical opinion will be considered adequate when it is based upon consideration of the Veteran's prior medical history and examinations and provides a sufficiently detailed description of the disability so that the Board's evaluation will be a fully informed one. Id. ; Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121, 124 (1991). A medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). Additionally, aggravation of a condition by a service-connected disability must be considered independently of direct causation, and medical examinations must provide adequate reasoning and conclusions on both points. Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74, 91 (2018).

While the Veteran was afforded a VA examination and medical opinion for the Veteran's right elbow disability in September 2020, the medical opinion only addressed secondary service connection through causation and not through aggravation. Thus, this medical opinion is inadequate for adjudicating the claim for secondary service connection and a duty to assist error exists. 

A remand is warranted to resolve the duty to assist error. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right elbow disability. The electronic claims file must be made accessible to the examiner for review in conjunction with the examination.

2. The VA examiner should address whether the Veteran's right elbow is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) aggravated (increased in severity beyond the natural progress of the disorder and does not have to be permanent) by his service-connected disabilities, including his service-connected left elbow disability. 

3. An explanation of all opinions expressed must be provided, with consideration given to all evidence of record, especially the Veteran's lay statements.
