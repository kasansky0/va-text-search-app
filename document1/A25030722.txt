ORDER

The appeal with respect to entitlement to a compensable rating for hypothyroidism has been withdrawn and is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

In a statement received from the Veteran in September 2024, she withdrew her appeal with respect to entitlement to a compensable rating for hypothyroidism. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal with respect to entitlement to a compensable rating for hypothyroidism are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2008 to June 2008. 

The Veteran perfected an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) by way of a July 2024 notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182) with respect to the denial of a compensable rating for compensable rating for hypothyroidism in a July 2024 rating decision.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative.  Id.

In a communication received from the Veteran in September 2024, she withdrew her appeal with respect to entitlement to a compensable rating for hypothyroidism.  As such, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration with respect to this matter.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal with respect to the matter of entitlement to a compensable rating for hypothyroidism and this matter is dismissed.
