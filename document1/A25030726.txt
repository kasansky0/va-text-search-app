DOCKET NO. 240712-455542
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In October 2024, the Veteran died while the appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1974 to June 1977 and from October 1979 to January 1987.  This matter is on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

Entitlement to an Earlier Effective Date: Aid and Attendance

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal.  As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths.  Zevalkink v. Brown, 102 F.3d 1236, 1243-44 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Smith v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 330, 333-34 (1997); Landicho v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 42, 47 (1994).  This appeal on the merits has become moot by virtue of the death of the appellant and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b).  Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

In this case, although the Veteran's former spouse has filed applications for burial benefits, dependency and indemnity compensation, and a request to add dependents, she has not formally requested to be substituted for the Veteran in his pending claim.  Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant."  The form and filing instructions are available online at https://www.va.gov/find-forms/.  If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the death and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).
