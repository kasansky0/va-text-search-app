ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On November 16, 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of this claim due to lack of justiciable case or controversy and the claim for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss must be dismissed as moot. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (a), 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1982 to October 1984, May 2003 to December 2003, and October 2021 to March 2022. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection - Bilateral Hearing Loss

This matter originally came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision. That rating decision constitutes a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal. 

In the Veteran's June 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran specified that the area of disagreement as to the November 2023 rating decision was "service connection," as to bilateral hearing loss. 

The Board has jurisdiction in all matters where there is a question of law or fact necessary for a decision by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans or their dependents or survivors. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 ; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 ; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104 (c).

As such, the Veteran's appeal for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is moot as the benefits sought on appeal have already been granted. See Baughman v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 563, 566 (1991). Because there remains no case or controversy concerning whether the Veteran is entitled to the benefits sought, as they have been granted, the claim is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d)(5).
