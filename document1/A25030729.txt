FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's neurocognitive disorder is etiologically related to his service-connected tinnitus.

2. The evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's OSA is etiologically related to his service-connected acquired psychiatric disability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a neurocognitive disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.310.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1970 to May 1976.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the January 23, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Regarding the claim for obstructive sleep apnea, although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the May 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. Therefore, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

Regarding service connection for a neurocognitive disorder, entitlement to TDIU, and increased rating for an acquired psychiatric disability, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the TDIU and the increased rating claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a neurocognitive disorder.

The Veteran contends that his neurocognitive disorder, claimed as dementia, was secondary to his service-connected tinnitus. 

Legal Criteria

A disability that is due to, or results from, another disease or injury for which service connection has been granted, will be considered part of the original disorder. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). 

Background Facts and Analysis

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran is currently service connected for PTSD with MDD and GAD. A January 2023 VA PTSD examination noted that the claimed disability of "dementia" is not a DSM-5 diagnosis and instead the proper term is a neurocognitive disorder, for which the Veteran met criteria for a diagnosis. The Veteran's VA treatment records establish the Veteran was formally diagnosed with dementia, or more precisely a neurocognitive disorder, in November 2022. While not formally diagnosed until November 2022, the VA records in the months preceding document the initial presentation and worsening of those symptoms. The January 2023 VA examiner provided an opinion that the Veteran's neurocognitive disorder was at least as likely as not proximately due to his service-connected tinnitus based on medical literature supporting a causal and worsening relationship between tinnitus and neurocognitive disorders. The Board finds this statement sufficient to establish a causal link between the Veteran's diagnosed neurocognitive disorder and his service-connected tinnitus. 

In sum, the Board finds that the Veteran's current neurocognitive disorder was caused by his service-connected tinnitus. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for a neurocognitive disorder is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.310.

2. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

The Veteran contends that his OSA is secondary to his service-connected disabilities, including PTSD and coronary artery disease.

Background Facts and Analysis

VA treatments and VA examinations note the Veteran was diagnosed with OSA by way of a sleep study in August 2009. See August 2009 treatment report; see also October 2023 VA examination. Therefore, the first element of service connection is met. The Veteran has maintained that he believed his OSA was secondary to several of his service-connected disabilities, either directly linked or by way of obesity as an intermediary step. See June 2023 VA Form 21-4138.

The Veteran provided a private opinion from Dr. V.Z. dated January 2024. Dr. V.Z. noted the Veteran's medical history and provided an opinion that the Veteran's OSA was secondary to his PTSD on two fronts. First, Dr. V.Z. noted that PTSD symptoms of nightmares and hypervigilance, which the Veteran routinely exhibited in the record, cause neuroplastic changes that lead to sleep fragmentation and arousals. These neuroplastic changes are causally linked to developing obstructive sleep apnea. Second, the examiner noted that sleep fragmentation and arousals lead to poor tolerance of CPAP treatment for OSA, which the Veteran was noted to need and also struggled with compliance.

The Board finds the January 2024 opinion from Dr. V.Z. regarding both the causation and aggravation of the Veteran's OSA by his PTSD persuasive because it was well supported in both fact and medical literature pertinent to the Veteran's specific diagnosis and medical history. 

The Board notes the October 2023 VA examination provided a negative opinion that the Veteran's OSA was not caused by his in-service TERA of herbicide exposure nor secondary to his coronary artery disease. However, this examination did not consider whether the Veteran's OSA was secondary to his PTSD.  

In sum, the Board finds that the Veteran's current OSA was caused and aggravated by his service-connected PTSD. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for OSA is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.310(b).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for an acquired psychiatric disability is remanded.

2. Entitlement to a total disability based on individual unemployability is remanded.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

"	The Board is granting service connection for a neurocognitive disorder herein.  The Board finds that there is overlap in symptomatology regarding the already service-connected psychiatric disability and the newly service-connected neurocognitive disorder.  Thus, the Board remands the increased rating claim for an acquired psychiatric as inextricably intertwined with the promulgation of the rating for the neurocognitive disorder.

"	Additionally, the Board grants service connection for two disabilities herein. Thus, the Board must remand for the AOJ to adjudicate the initial grants of service connection and consider the impacts of these grants on the pending entitlement to TDIU as these issues are inextricably intertwined.

THE REMAND DIRECTIVES FOLLOW

1. Implement the Board's decision granting service connection for obstructive sleep apnea and neurocognitive disorder and assign appropriate ratings and effective dates.

2. Readjudicate.
