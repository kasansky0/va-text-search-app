DOCKET NO. 230718-361618
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In April 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) was notified that the Veteran died in March 2024, as verified by his death certificate.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the appeal at this time.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to August 1971.  This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a rating decision issued in June 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  In July 2023, the Veteran filed a timely Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and requested a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge; however, he passed away prior to the scheduling of such hearing.

Unfortunately, the Veteran, who is the appellant, died during the pendency of this appeal.  Specifically, in April 2024, the Board was notified that he died in March 2024, as verified by his death certificate.  Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the above captioned claim at this time and must dismiss this appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claims.  This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b).  Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a). However, in the instant case, there is no indication that VA received a request for substitution. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
