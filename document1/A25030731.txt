ORDER

An effective date of May 6, 2019, and no earlier, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea was received by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) on May 6, 2019.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of May 6, 2019, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.104, 3.151, 3.155, 3.157, 3.303, 3.400, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 16, 1999, to December 9, 1999; March 24, 2003, to November 20, 2003; and January 5, 2004, to December 5, 2004.

In an October 2023 Supplemental rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for obstructive sleep apnea and assigned such an initial 50 percent rating, effective August 10, 2022.  The Veteran filed an October 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Higher-Level Review Claim, asserting entitlement to an earlier effective date for his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea.  The AOJ, in a February 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision, denied his claim.  The Veteran filed an April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), electing Direct Review of the February 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) of the VA Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  See 38 U.S.C. § 7113 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202 (b)(1), 20.301. 

As such, the Board's decision will be based on the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 7113 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.801(a). With respect to the February 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision, that means the evidentiary record is limited to the evidence of record as of the date the October 2023 Supplemental rating decision was mailed to the Veteran, October 5, 2023.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601 (f).  Despite the fully favorable decision  herein, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require all claims be filed on a standard form.  The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats.  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.151, 3.155, 3.157. 

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance, will be the date VA receives the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The reference to "the date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation.  The effective date of the award of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a disability or causal connection, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed.  Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999). 

However, where compensation is awarded pursuant to a liberalizing law, or regulation, "the effective date of such award or increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the act or administrative issue."  38 U.S.C. § 5110; see, e.g., Brown v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 290, 296 (2007).  In essence, when there is no facts-found basis to grant, the liberalizing law's effective date is "the date entitlement arose."  McGrath, at 35.  In other words, if the VA received a claim prior to the liberalizing law's effective date, and the claim is granted based on the liberalizing law and not on a facts-found basis, then the later liberalizing law's effective date is the controlling date in awarding serviced connection.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Likewise, if a claim was received after the liberalizing law's effective date, then the controlling date for an award of service connection would be the date the claim was received since that is the later date, as instructed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

On August 10, 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (Aug. 10, 2022), was signed into law.  This is a liberalizing law which, as applicable to Persian Gulf Veterans, created a broader presumption for exposure to burn pits and other toxins (BPOT), to include fine particulate matter.  However, the PACT Act did not establish obstructive sleep apnea as a new or modified presumptive condition.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309; 38 U.S.C. §§ 1116 (a)(2).  That said, even if a disease is not listed as presumed, direct service connection must be considered.  See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  

In this case, the AOJ, in its October 2023 Supplemental rating decision, granted entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea related to in-service participation in Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA), considering the PACT Act and assigning the effective date for service connection to reflect such, August 10, 2022.  The Board notes that a September 2023 VA examiner provided an opinion that the Veteran's sleep apnea was related to his in service toxic exposure risk activities.  

By way of history, related to the Veteran's May 6, 2019, VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, the AOJ, in a July 2019 rating decision, denied entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected PTSD with major depressive disorder, the theory of entitlement asserted by the Veteran.  The Veteran filed a May 2021 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request:  Supplemental Claim, which is accepted as timely under the Covid-19 extension provisions, to which the AOJ issued a July 2021 Supplemental rating decision denying his claim.  The Veteran filed an October 2021 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request:  Higher-Level Review Claim, to which the AOJ issued a December 2021 Higher-Level Review rating decision denying his claim.  The Veteran then filed a June 2023 Supplemental Claim, which is accepted as timely under the Covid-19 extension provisions, to which the AOJ issued the October 2023 Supplemental rating decision discussed above, granting service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, effective August 10, 2022.  

Of record is the July 2019 rating decision in which the AOJ favorably found, findings binding on the Board in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error, that the Veteran had been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and was service-connected for PTSD with major depressive disorder.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).  Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for a disability that is caused by a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).

Of record are also the May 2019 and July 2021 VA negative etiological opinions and the July 2020 private positive etiological opinion as to whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is secondary to service-connected PTSD with major depressive disorder.  In brief, the VA examiner cited the Veteran's risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea, the nature of his obesity and prescription medication used treat his psychiatric diagnoses, and medical literature as to obstructive sleep apnea and his psychiatric diagnoses and concluded that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's disability was secondary to his service-connected PTSD with major depressive disorder.  The private examiner cited the same information, with additional medical literature, and opined that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD with major depressive disorder caused weight gain/obesity and that weight gain/obesity caused or contributed to obstructive sleep apnea, fully addressing obesity as an intermediate step between obstructive sleep apnea and service-connected PTSD with major depressive disorder.  See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020) (holding that obesity as an "intermediate step" in a causal chain for service connection can be established on either a causal or aggravation basis).

The probative value of a medical opinion is generally based on the scope of the examination or review, as well as the relative merits of the expert's qualifications and analytical findings, and the probative weight of a medical opinion may be reduced if the examiner fails to explain the basis for an opinion.  Sklar v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 140 (1993).  The Board thus finds, based on its complete discussion of the Veteran's obesity, the July 2020 private etiological opinion to be more probative on this issue.

As such, there is probative medical evidence that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was caused by his service-connected PTSD with major depressive disorder, which would require that service connection be granted as of the latest of the two relevant dates, the date of the claim, and the date entitlement arose.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.310, 3.400.  

Thus, the date of the Veteran's claim is May 6, 2019.  There is no indication that there is of record a prior claim of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea and no party asserts otherwise.  The Veteran has continuously pursued his claim of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea since May 6, 2019.  The date entitlement arose is also May 6, 2019, the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed.  Lalonde, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382.  On May 6, 2019, the Veteran had obstructive sleep apnea and he was service-connected PTSD with major depressive disorder.  Id.  Consequently, an effective date of May 6, 2019, and no earlier, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is warranted; the claim is granted.
