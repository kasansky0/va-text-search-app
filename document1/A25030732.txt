ORDER

Service connection for a right shoulder disability is denied.

Service connection for a left shoulder disability is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's right and left shoulder disabilities did not manifest within one year of discharge from service and are not otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a left shoulder disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for a right shoulder disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1990 to April 1997. 

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision. The Veteran requested a higher level review (HLR) of this rating decision. The HLR decision denied the claims in April 2024, and the Veteran timely appealed the April 2024 rating decision to the Board, requesting the Direct Review Docket. This means that the Board, in adjudicating this appeal, may only review the evidence that was of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision. To the extent evidence was received after that time, the Board may not consider it unless a supplemental claim is received that either identifies or resubmits the evidence.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Veteran seeks service connection for his left and right shoulders. He contends that he sustained several injuries to his shoulders during military service and that he has experienced pain and weakness since service separation. See VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, dated in December 2021. 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C.§ 1110; 38 C.F.R.§ 3.303. Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service (nexus). Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Certain chronic diseases, to include arthritis will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In the appealed April 2024 HLR rating action, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) made, in part, the following favorable findings: (i) The Veteran was diagnosed with right and left shoulder disabilities as the August 2023 VA examination contained diagnoses of right and left shoulder strains and, (ii) the Veteran sustained an in-service qualifying event; the Veteran's military occupation specialty (MOS) was a Wheeled Vehicle Repairer, a position that required repetitive use such as lifting, rotating, and working in confined space. See April 2024 rating action at pages (pgs.) 3-4)). Thus, Shedden elements number one (1), evidence of current disability, and two (2), service incurrence, have been met. 

Thus, the question that remains is whether there is a nexus between the diagnosed left and right shoulder strains and the Veteran's period of military service, Shedden element number three. 

The Board further finds that the weight of the evidence is against this element of the claims, and they will be denied. There are two VA opinions that address the nexus element, and they are both against the claims. VA examined the Veteran in August 2023. After a physical evaluation of the Veteran's shoulders and a claims file review, the same VA examiner collectively opined that based on a review of the available evidence, it was less likely than not that the claimed conditions were due to service because there was a lack of substantiating evidence supporting a nexus between the current diagnoses of left and right shoulder strains and military service. The VA examiner further reasoned that without chronicity during service or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury was considered to be a more likely etiology. With respect to the right shoulder, the VA examiner reported that the Veteran denied any known injury or trauma. See August 2023 VA opinions. The Board finds that the August 2023 VA opinions are supported by the evidence of record, namely the lack of right or left shoulder complaints in service, and therefore, are found to be more probative than the Veteran's December 2021 statement to VA that he had injured his shoulders during service. There is no other opinion that is supportive of the claims for service connection for right and left shoulder disabilities on a direct service connection theory of entitlement. 

It is noted that the Veteran's STRs show that he did seek treatment for orthopedic conditions such as knee problems, as well as a number of other ailments, suggesting that he was willing to have medical problems addressed.  However, there were no shoulder complaints addressed, which undermines a contention of continuity of symptomatology since service. 

In addition, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted for a right or left shoulder disability under the presumptive theory of service connection under 3.309(a). Here, arthritis was not noted in either shoulder during service or within a year of discharge. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). The Veteran was initially diagnosed with right shoulder degenerative arthritis in August 2023, decades after separating from service. 

Service connection is also not warranted for either the left or right shoulder based on a theory of chronicity and continuity of symptomatology because no right or left shoulder complaints or findings were noted in service or within a year of discharge, and there is no credible evidence showing continued left or right shoulder symptoms thereafter. The Veteran's lay statements of having had continuous left and right shoulder pain since service are inconsistent with the other evidence of record, notably the post-service medical evidence which is silent for shoulder complaints despite having sought treatment for other medical concerns. Accordingly, 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) does not provide an avenue of service connection based on chronicity or continuity of symptomatology for either the left or right shoulder.

The Board emphasizes that the Veteran's service treatment records and his post-service treatment records make no reference to any in-service shoulder injuries. The Board is cognizant the Veteran is competent to report evidence that is within the realm of his personal knowledge, to include onset and continuity of symptoms or treatment for a disability. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). However, the Board finds the lay reports of continuity of shoulder symptoms since service separation are not credible for reasons noted herein. 

In conclusion, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's bilateral shoulder conditions occurred during or were otherwise etiologically related to his active service. Service connection for right and left shoulder disabilities is denied.
