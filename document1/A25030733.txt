DOCKET NO. 240305-420929
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity (RLE) radiculopathy is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran appealed entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for RLE radiculopathy in a separate VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) also filed on March 5, 2024.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the instant appeal seeking entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for RLE radiculopathy have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.201.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1979 to April 1988.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

On March 5, 2024, the Veteran filed two separate notices of disagreement seeking entitlement to an increased rating for service-connected RLE radiculopathy. See March 2024 VA Form 10182's. As detailed below, the Board finds the instant notice of disagreement did not initiate a valid appeal to the Board. 

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d). 

In both VA Form 10182's filed on March 5, 2024, the Veteran specifically listed the issue on appeal as "denial of entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20% for radiculopathy, right lower extremity." The Board subsequently docketed both appeals based on the filing of the separate notices of disagreement. The Veteran, however, is unable to initiate a new, separate appeal for the same issue already before the Board in the corresponding appeal filed on March 5, 2024.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the March 5, 2024, VA Form 10182 filed in the instant appeal is duplicative, as it appeals the same issue set forth in the alternate March 5, 2024, notice of disagreement. As such, the instant appeal must be dismissed. Id.

The Board notes that dismissal of this appeal will not result in prejudice to the Veteran, as the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for RLE radiculopathy will be addressed by the Board in a separate decision.
