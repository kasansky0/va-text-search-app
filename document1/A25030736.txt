ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The competent medical evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran has a hearing loss disability in either ear, as defined by VA regulation.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2019 to August 2022.  Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss was denied by the regional office in a September 2023 rating decision.  Thereafter, the Veteran submitted a timely June 2024 notice of disagreement on VA Form 10182 and selected direct review of the evidence.  As such, the Board's review is restricted to that evidence that was available at the time of the underlying September 2023 rating decision.  With this in mind, the Board highlights that a July 2024 VA audiology examination was added to the claims file in support of the Veteran's December 2023 supplemental claim again seeking entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  This examination may not be considered in the present appeal, as it is dated outside the evidentiary review period.  

Service Connection for Bilateral Hearing Loss is Denied

The Veteran contends that he was exposed to excessive noise while in service which resulted in bilateral hearing loss.  As the Board finds that there is no objective medical evidence to support that he has a diagnosis of hearing loss in either ear for VA compensation purposes, service connection must be denied for the condition. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d).

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory threshold for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran was afforded a VA audiology examination in August 2023, with testing that revealed the following pure tone thresholds: 

??? 	HERTZ??? 	??? 

?? 	500??? 	1000??? 	2000??? 	3000??? 	4000??? 

RIGHT??? 	5? 	10? 	0??? 	5??? 	5 

LEFT??? 	5?? 	5??? 	10?? 	15??? 	10??? 

 

The average pure tone threshold result in the right ear was 5, and in the left ear it was 10.  The speech discrimination score using the Maryland CNC word list was 100 percent in both ears. The examiner declined to diagnose the Veteran with?hearing loss?in either ear and further found that any hearing impairment did not result in impairment of occupational functioning.  Additionally, the examiner declined to set forth any opinion as to the likely etiology of the claimed hearing loss without a diagnosis confirmed by testing. 

There are no available post-service medical records which show that the Veteran has undergone any treatment for hearing impairment or that he has been diagnosed with hearing loss in either ear.  As such, the audiological testing during the August 2023 examination represents the only objective medical evidence in the claims file concerning the claimed bilateral hearing loss disability. 

Based on the examination results and the lack of a diagnosis in the available medical records, the Veteran has not had a?hearing loss?disability in either ear at any point during the pendency of the appeal under VA standards pursuant to?38?C.F.R. §?3.385.  The Board recognizes that the Veteran, as a lay person, is competent to describe the symptoms of hearing loss.  Layno?v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 469 (1994).  However, the audiometric testing results from the VA examination, undisturbed as those results are by any contrary medical evidence, have far more probative weight than the lay testimony as to the Veteran's hearing difficulty.  Lay persons such as the Veteran are not competent to provide the audiometric findings necessary for a finding of a?hearing loss?disability as defined by?38?C.F.R. §?3.385.  

The fact remains that the post-service medical records do not contain a diagnosis of?hearing loss?in either ear for VA purposes pursuant to?38?C.F.R. §?3.385.  Without a diagnosis by a medical professional, there is no valid claim of service connection under?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a) for such disability.? Brammer v. Derwinski, 3?Vet. App.?223, 225?(1992); 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b).  As indicated above, the Veteran lacks the training or credentials to competently provide a diagnosis.  There is no evidence of hearing loss in either ear for VA purposes during the appeal period.  The claim is accordingly denied.
