ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for broken nose residuals with rhinitis is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 14, 2022, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as secondary to broken nose residuals with rhinitis, is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2021, for the award of service connection for sinus headache, as secondary to broken nose residuals with rhinitis, is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for sinus headache as secondary to broken nose residuals with rhinitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The record does not contain evidence indicating that the Veteran has at least a 50 percent obstruction of both nasal passages or complete obstruction on one side due to his service-connected broken nose residuals with rhinitis.

2. In November 2017, the agency of original jurisdiction denied entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); the Veteran was notified of this decision and did not file a notice of disagreement or submit new and material evidence within one year.

3. On March 14, 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for OSA as secondary to broken nose residuals with rhinitis.

4. The Veteran did not file an original claim for entitlement to service connection for sinus headaches; a June 2022 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for sinus headaches as secondary to broken nose residuals with rhinitis based on a sympathetic reading of the evidence of record. The effective date has been established in accordance with facts found during a VA examination on September 11, 2021.

5. The Veteran experienced sinus headaches with less frequent attacks. The sinus headaches did not manifest in characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable rating for broken nose residuals with rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.4, 4.14, 4.20, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6502.

2. The November 2017 rating decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103.

3. The criteria for an effective date prior to March 14, 2022, for the award of service connection for OSA, as secondary to broken nose residuals with rhinitis, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

4. The criteria for an effective date prior to September 11, 2021, for the award of service connection for sinus headaches, as secondary to broken nose residuals with rhinitis, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

5. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for sinus headaches have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from May 1987 to April 1990.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, the agency of original jurisdiction.

In a June 2022 rating decision, the AOJ: (1) granted entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with an evaluation of 50 percent, effective March 14, 2022; (2) granted entitlement to service connection for sinus headache with an evaluation of 0 percent, effective September 11, 2021; (3) and maintained the 0 percent disability rating for broken nose residuals with rhinitis. In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review. In October 2023, the AOJ issued a higher-level review decision denying entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for OSA and sinus headache, and continued the 0 percent disability ratings for sinus headache and broken nose residuals with rhinitis.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.?? 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. §?20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801.?? 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. §?3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.?? 

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for broken nose residuals with rhinitis

In an August 2021 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for broken nose residuals with rhinitis and assigned a 0 percent rating, effective October 15, 2015. The decision noted that the VA would be scheduling an examination to fully evaluate the Veteran's condition. 

Following a September 2021 VA examination, rating decisions dated June 2022 and October 2023 determined that the Veteran's broken nose residuals with rhinitis remains 0 percent disabling. The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a disability rating in excess of 0 percent for broken nose residuals with rhinitis.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.??? 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.??? 

Where an increase in the level of a disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?55 (1994). Where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods in which the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant evaluations during the course of the appeal, the assignment of staged ratings is appropriate. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. (2007).??? 

In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. Pyramiding, the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when rating a Veteran's service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R § 4.14. 

Generally, separate disability ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not "duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology" of the other condition. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994). The Court has also held that within a particular diagnostic code, a claimant is not entitled to more than one disability rating for a single disability unless the regulation expressly provides otherwise. Cullen v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 74 (2010). 

The Veteran's broken nose residuals with rhinitis is currently evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6502, which provides for a maximum 10 percent disability rating when there is 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides, or complete obstruction on one side. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97. 

The Veteran first underwent a VA examination to evaluate his broken nose residuals in September 2021. The Board notes that prior to this, the record contains very little evidence regarding the severity of the Veteran's broken nose residuals. For example, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in February 2017 that did not evaluate the Veteran's condition, but did confirm his diagnosis of broken nose residuals and its relation to active service. Subsequently, during a VA examination for sleep apnea in November 2017, the Veteran reported that he has had trouble breathing through his nose since his injury during active service. The examiner noted that the file did not contain a report of nasal fracture and added that an evaluation with nasal bone x-ray would be beneficial.

During the VA examination in September 2021, the examiner noted that while the Veteran has a deviated nasal septum (traumatic) and rhinitis, they have not resulted in at least 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.

In addition, subsequent VA treatment records from January, February, and April 2022 describe the Veteran's nose as normal.

None of the evidence discussed above include medical findings that satisfy the criteria to award a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6502. Additionally, while the Veteran reported having difficulty breathing through his nose, the Veteran's statement does not meet the criteria for a 10 percent award under DC 6502.

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence is against the claim of entitlement to a compensable rating for service-connected broken nose residuals with rhinitis under Diagnostic Code 6502, and to this extent only, the benefit sought on appeal is denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 14, 2022, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as secondary to broken nose residuals with rhinitis.

The Veteran, through his representative, contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than March 14, 2022 for the grant of service connection for OSA, as secondary to broken nose residuals with rhinitis. Specifically, the Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date of October 15, 2015, the effective date for the Veteran's service-connected broken nose residuals with rhinitis.

Generally, the effective date of the VA's award of compensation for disability will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R § 3.400. For supplemental claims received more than one year after the notice of the previous decision on a particular issue, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for OSA in August 2017, which the VA denied in a November 2017 rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal that rating decision.

Under the legacy system in effect at the time of the Veteran's November 2017 rating decision, a claimant had one year from the date of the mailing of a notice of a decision, to appeal such decision with a notice of disagreement. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. Additionally, for claims adjudicated prior to February 19, 2019, where new and material evidence (NME) was received within one year after the initial denial, the claim was not final, and it remained pending. See 38 U.S.C. § 5108 (2018); 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a). Under the NME evidence standard, "new" evidence is that which was not previously submitted to agency decision makers. Material evidence is that which by itself, or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact that is necessary to substantiate the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).

The Veteran took no further explicit action to seek service connection for OSA until March 14, 2022, the date he filed a supplemental claim for service connection for OSA. In a June 2022 rating decision, the VA granted service connection for OSA with an evaluation of 50 percent, effective March 14, 2022. 

As noted above, the Veteran was initially denied service connection for OSA in November 2017. He did not file a notice of disagreement or submit new and material evidence within one year of the notification of the decision. In addition, the Veteran nor his representative have asserted that the Veteran did not receive the notification letter informing him of the November 2017 rating decision. 

Thus, the November 2017 rating decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103; Cook v. Principi, 318 F.3d 1334, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The Veteran's supplemental claim was received on March 14, 2022, more than a one year after the notice of the previous decision. As such, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim, in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2). Accordingly, the Veteran's claim is denied.

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2021, for the award of service connection for sinus headache, as secondary to broken nose residuals with rhinitis

4. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for sinus headache as secondary to broken nose residuals with rhinitis

The Veteran, through his representative, asserts that he is entitled to a disability rating of 50 percent, effective October 15, 2015, for sinus headache as secondary to broken nose residuals with rhinitis. 

Generally, the effective date of the VA's award of compensation for disability will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R § 3.400.

Sinus headaches are rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100. Under DC 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for headaches with less frequent attacks. A 10 percent rating is warranted for headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months. 

The rating criteria of DC 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018). This renders 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable. Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252. 

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under DC 8100 to describe the nature and severity of headaches, but is not defined in the regulation. Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." Thus, the phrase "character prostrating attacks" is understood to describe headache attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness. 

In the June 2022 rating decision, the AOJ determined that while the Veteran's sinus headache was not explicitly identified on a standardized form, it is an issue within scope based on a sympathetic reading of his statements and/or evidence of record. See 38 C.F.R. 4.6. The AOJ further determined that September 11, 2021 was the date entitlement to service connection arose, based on evidence from a September 2021 VA examination for headaches.

After thoroughly reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the September 2021 examination is the earliest date that entitlement to service connection arose, and the Veteran's headaches have occurred with less frequent attacks since that date. This corresponds to the criteria for a noncompensable rating under DC 8100.

The record is silent for a headache diagnosis prior to September 11, 2021. There is also minimal/inconsistent evidence of complaints or treatment regarding headaches prior to September 2021. During his separation examination in March 1990, the Veteran noted that he experiences migraine occasionally. During VA examinations in February 2017 and June 2021, the Veteran endorsed headaches attributable to a traumatic brain injury, but did not describe their frequency. In August 2020, the Veteran contacted the VA to ask what medication he could take for chronic headaches and was advised to take Tylenol. At a VA examination for mental disorders in June 2021, the Veteran complained of frequent headaches, but in August 2021, the Veteran denied headache.

In September 2021, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for headaches. During the examination, the Veteran stated that he takes over the counter Acetaminophen as needed for his sinus headaches. The examiner noted that the Veteran has the following symptoms: headache pain on both sides of the head and non-headache pain, such as sensitivity to sound. The Veteran reported that his typical head pain lasts one to two days. Of note, the examiner specifically determined that the Veteran's reported symptoms do not constitute characteristic prostrating attacks.

Subsequent VA treatment records show that the Veteran complained of daily headaches in January 2022 but denied headaches in February and April 2022.

The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to describe his head pain and other symptoms. While the Veteran has described these symptoms on different occasions, the September 2021 VA examiner found that his symptoms do not constitute characteristic prostrating attacks. 

A compensable rating under DC 8100 is not warranted unless there are headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months. 

Therefore, when considering all relevant evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran does not experience characteristic prostrating attacks. This does not disregard the symptoms reported by the Veteran, and the Board acknowledges that the Veteran's sinus headaches do have an impact on his life. However, as these symptoms do not constitute a characteristic prostrating attack, they do not meet the 10 percent rating criteria which the Board must apply. 

Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran's sinus headaches occurred with less frequent attacks throughout the appeal period. The Veteran's sinus headaches did not occur with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months at any time since September 11, 2021. Therefore, a compensable rating under DC 8100 is not warranted.
