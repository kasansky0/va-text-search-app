ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 15, 2023, for the award of a 30 percent disability rating for service-connected chronic sinusitis, is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A December 2017 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), granted entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis, which assigned a noncompensable disability rating, effective July 4, 2017; in March 2019, the appellant appealed this decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

2. In a February 2020 Board decision, the issues of entitlement to an effective date prior to July 4, 2017, and a compensable initial disability rating were denied. 

3. In November 2021, the appellant filed a claim for an increased disability rating his service connected-chronic sinusitis via VA Form 21-526EZ; in a December 2021 rating decision, the increased rating claim was denied. 

4. In September 2022, and on April 15, 2023, the appellant filed a claim for an increased disability rating for service-connected chronic sinusitis via VA Form 21-526EZ; a subsequent October 2023 rating decision increased the appellant's disability rating from noncompensable to 30 percent disabling, effective from April 15, 2023.

5. In November 2023, the appellant filed a VA Form 21-526EZ indicating that he wanted an earlier effective date of July 4, 2017. The appellant has not raised a valid claim that clear and unmistakable error (CUE) exists with any rating decision.

6. The appellant's November 2023 claim for an earlier effective date is a "freestanding claim" for an earlier effective date. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The claim for an earlier effective date for the award of a 30 percent disability rating for service-connected chronic sinusitis is an impermissible freestanding claim for an earlier effective date and is dismissed as a matter of law. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The appellant had active service in the United States Army from November 1977 to November 1980.  

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision. 

Procedurally, in a December 2017 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis and assigned a noncompensable disability rating effective July 4, 2017. In March 2019, the appellant appealed this decision to the Board.

In a February 2020 Board decision, the issues of entitlement to an effective date prior to July 4, 2017, and a compensable initial disability rating were denied. 

In November 2021, the appellant filed a claim for an increased disability rating his service connected-chronic sinusitis via VA Form 21-526EZ. The claim was denied in a December 2021 rating decision. 

In September 2022, the appellant filed a claim for an increased disability rating his service connected-chronic sinusitis via VA Form 21-526EZ. In a September 2022 rating decision, the AOJ awarded an increased rating of 30 percent for the appellant's service-connected rhinitis only.

On April 15, 2023, the appellant filed a claim for an increased disability rating for service-connected chronic sinusitis via VA Form 21-526EZ. In an October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ increased the appellant's disability rating from noncompensable to 30 percent, effective April 15, 2023.

In November 2023, the appellant filed a VA Form 21-526EZ indicating that he wanted an earlier effective date of July 4, 2017.

In the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ denied an effective date prior to April 15, 2023, for the award of 30 percent disability rating for service-connected chronic sinusitis.  

In March 2024, the appellant submitted a notice of disagreement (NOD (via VA Form 10182)), appealing the January 2024 decision to the Board, and requesting the Board's Direct Review docket.

Evidentiary Window

As the appellant selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue(s) on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301. The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The appellant has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to April 15, 2023, for the award of a 30 percent disability rating for service-connected chronic sinusitis, is dismissed.

The appellant contends that an earlier effective date than April 15, 2023, is warranted for the award of a 30 percent disability rating for his service-connected chronic sinusitis. See VA Form 21-526EZ, November 22, 2023. Specifically, he asserts that an effective date of July 4, 2017, is warranted. Id.

Legal Criteria

Reconsideration of an appellant decision may be accorded at any time by the Board on motion by the appellant or his or her representative or on the Board's own motion upon allegation of obvious error of fact or law. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1001(a). A motion for Reconsideration must be in writing and must include the name of the veteran; the applicable file number; the date of the Board Decision to be reconsidered; and must set forth clearly and specifically the alleged obvious error, or errors, of fact or law in the applicable decision or the appropriate basis for requesting Reconsideration. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1002(a).

In Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that veterans are prohibited from collaterally attacking a prior final decision by filing a freestanding earlier effective date claim. The Court specifically held that, once a decision has become final, a claimant may not properly file, and VA has no authority to adjudicate, a freestanding earlier effective date claim to overcome the finality of a decision. The Court reasoned that to allow such claims would vitiate the rule of finality. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299. The only way to modify the effective date for a service connection issue after the appeal period is by asserting CUE in a prior final decision. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a).

Analysis

In this instance, as previously noted, the service connection for chronic sinusitis was awarded with an effective date of July 4, 2017, and assigned a noncompensable initial disability rating in the February 2020 Board Decision.  The appellant has not alleged an allegation of obvious error of fact or law in the February 2020 Board Decision. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1001, 20.1002. This finding effectively forecloses any further inquiry into the prior adjudications and past evaluations, leaving the Board with the remaining non-initial rating claims received in November 2021, September 2022, and April 2023.

An increased rating claim filed on a VA Form 21-526EZ is an "initial claim" requesting a higher rating based on a change or worsening of the condition and does not constitute a request for review of a rating assigned in a prior decision. Moreover, the appellant did not assert CUE in a prior final rating decision when he filed his November 2021 and September 2022 claims for increased rating for chronic sinusitis. See 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a). 

Furthermore, on the November 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, the appellant did not express disagreement with the 30 percent disability rating assigned by the AOJ in the October 2023 rating decision. See VA Form 21-526EZ, November 22, 2023. Instead, he specifically stated "Sinus-Early effective date 07/04/2017." Id.

If the appellant believes that a CUE occurred in a prior decision, the appellant is free to file the appropriate motion. The motion must clearly identify the specific decision which contains error, identify the specific issue within that decision, and provide persuasive reasons why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error. 

However, as it stands, the Board cannot adjudicate the appellant's earlier effective date claim without violating the Court's express prohibition in Rudd against freestanding earlier effective date claims. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 296. Again, the appellant has not asserted that his request for an earlier effective date should be construed as a motion to revise based on CUE. Were the Board to consider this matter, it would constitute a freestanding earlier effective date claim and must be dismissed as a matter of law. Id. at 300.

As there is no legal entitlement to an effective date earlier than that assigned, the claim must be dismissed as a matter of law. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
