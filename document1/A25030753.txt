ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 17, 2022, for the award of a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claim for service connection for headaches was received on March 29, 2021. There are no prior pending claims for service connection for headaches.

2. Prior to November 17, 2022, the Veteran's migraine headaches did not manifest as characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months, characteristic prostrating attacks averaging once a month over the last several months, or very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to November 17, 2022, for the award of a 50 percent disability rating for migraine headaches, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from November 1987 to November 1989. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023. Since this constitutes an initial decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), issued after the effective date of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the modernized review system applies. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).

The Veteran appealed this decision by submitting a VA Form 20-0996, Higher-Level Review (HLR) request; however, the AOJ continued to deny the claim in a March 2024 rating decision. The Veteran continued her appeal by submitting a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD). In doing so, the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Effective Dates

The general rule regarding effective dates is that the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2), the effective date of an award of increased disability compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Id.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a), (b)(2).

1. Entitlement to an effective date, earlier than November 17, 2022, for the assignment of a 50 percent evaluation for migraine headaches.

The Veteran contends that an effective date, earlier than November 17, 2022, is warranted for the assignment of a 50 percent rating for her service-connected migraine headaches. Currently, she is in receipt of a noncompensable rating for the period prior to November 17, 2022; therefore, the Veteran is contesting the effective date for a staged rating. These effective dates are governing by the rules applicable to the assignment of effective dates for increased ratings.

Using the principles set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the effective date for an increased rating or staged rating is predicated on when the increase in the level of disability can be ascertained. Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015); DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 56 (2011). In determining when an increase is "factually ascertainable," all of the evidence must be considered, including testimonial evidence and expert medical opinions, and an effective date must be assigned based on that evidence. See McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 3536 (2000). The effective date should not be "assigned mechanically" as of the date of an examination. Swain, 27 Vet. App. at 224 n.4 (2015). There must be a factual basis for choosing an earlier date.

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran's headaches have been evaluated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100. Under Diagnostic Code 8100, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months. A 30 percent disability evaluation is assigned where there are characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average once a month over the last several months. For a higher, 50 percent disability evaluation to be warranted, there must be migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100. A 50 percent rating is the highest rating available under the Schedular criteria governing the evaluation of headaches.

The rating criteria do not define "prostrating" as used in Diagnostic Code 8100. By way of reference, the Board notes that according to Webster's New College Dictionary, 909 (3rd Ed. 2008), "prostrate" is defined as "physically or emotionally exhausted." "Incapacitated" is listed as a synonym. A very similar definition is found in Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 1554 (31st Ed. 2007), in which "prostration" is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."

Similarly, the regulations provide no clarification as to the meaning of the phrase "productive of severe economic inadaptability." The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), however, has issued a precedential decision which focuses on the meaning of this phrase. In Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440 (2004), the Court interpreted the phrase as follows: "nothing in Diagnostic Code 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50% rating" because "[i]f 'economic inadaptability' were read to import unemployability," a claimant who "met the economic-inadaptability criterion, would then be eligible for a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability [(TDIU)]... rather than just a 50% rating." Id.

The Court therefore rejected the notion that "severe economic inadaptability" was equivalent to an inability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, the unemployability standard for TDIU. Id. (citing 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a). In addition, the Court in Pierce acknowledged the VA Secretary's concession that the phrase "productive of severe economic inadaptability" in Diagnostic Code 8100 should be construed as either "producing" or "capable of producing" severe economic inadaptability. Id. at 445.

Unlike most rating codes, 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a Diagnostic Code 8100 for headaches is successive and cumulative, meaning that all the criteria for a higher rating must be met for the higher rating to be warranted. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018).

	Analysis

Initially, the Board must determine the date of claim for the appeal period. The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for headaches on November 29, 1993, this claim was denied in a May 12, 1994 rating decision. No appeal was taken from this decision and no new and material evidence was submitted within one year of this decision, so the rating decision is final and the November 1993 claim is not pending. On March 26, 2015, the Veteran filed a request to reopen the claim for service connection for headaches based on new and material evidence, the claim was denied in a September 14, 2015 rating decision. No appeal was taken from this decision and no new and material evidence was submitted within one year of this decision, thus, it became final and the March 2015 claim is not pending.

The Veteran then filed a VA 526EZ claim form claiming service connection for headaches on December 15, 2020. She was informed in a March 2021 letter that  this was the incorrect form and directed to file the claim on the correct form. On March 29, 2021, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection on the correct form. In an April 2021 decision the Veteran was awarded service connection for headaches and assigned a noncompensable rating. The Veteran has consistently pursued her appeal of this rating since this decision, thus, the Board finds that the appeal period begins on March 29, 2021.

The remaining question is when entitlement to an increased rating arose. If it arose after March 29, 2021 the effective date is the date entitlement arose as the later of the two dates, if entitlement arose before March 29, 2021, then the effective date is March 29, 2021, as the later of the two dates. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

In the decision on appeal, the AOJ relied on a November 17, 2022, private medical opinion in awarding the Veteran a 50 percent rating. In the opinion, the examiner specifically noted that the Veteran's headaches met the definition of "prostrating;" thus, warranting a 50 percent rating. However, the Veteran's prior examinations do not show headache symptoms of the same severity. 

For example, in her March 2021 VA headaches examination, the Veteran reported having 1 to 2 headaches per month, and she reported that she takes extra strength Tylenol for pain. She was noted to have pain on both sides of the head, with headache pain lasting less than 1 day, as well as sensitivity to light and sound. However, there were no prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine pain, and the examiner found that the Veteran's headaches did not impact the Veteran's ability to work. 

Similarly, in her April 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported that her migraines have progressed. Again, she reported taking extra strength Tylenol. The examiner noted symptoms of pulsating or throbbing head pain, with pain on both sides of the head. It was noted that pain worsens with physical activity. The Veteran had non-headache symptoms that included sensitivity to light and changes in vision. Her head pain lasted less than 1 day, and she had no characteristic prostrating attacks of headache pain, and no very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine headaches. The examiner found that the Veteran's headaches did not impact the Veteran's ability to work. 

In addition to the above, the Board observes the Veteran's VA treatment records do not show that the Veteran's headaches were prostrating or caused prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability prior to November 17, 2022.  In a July 2020 VA medical visit, the Veteran reported that her migraines are changing; however, she did not specify how. Nevertheless, a subsequent March 2021 treatment record shows that the Veteran's migraines were stable.

Based on the above, the first factually ascertainable evidence showing a worsening of the Veteran's headaches was in the November 17, 2022, private medical opinion. Prior to this, the evidence does not show that the Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks one in two months over the last several months, characteristic prostrating attacks once a month over the last several months or that her headaches occurred with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100. Therefore, entitlement to a compensable rating for her headaches did not arise prior to November 17, 2022. Given that this date is after the March 29, 2021 date of claim, November 17, 2022, is the appropriate effective date for the award of the 50 percent rating for headaches. The persuasive evidence of record is against the claim; therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
