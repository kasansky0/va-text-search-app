DOCKET NO. 240927-507725
DATE: April 3, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical care furnished to the Veteran from October 29, 2015, to March 2, 2017, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1960 to December 1963.

The decision on appeal was issued in September 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In his September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. However, with the VA Form 10182, he also submitted new evidence. In a March 2025 docketing letter, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) provided notice to the Veteran that the additional evidence he submitted could not be considered unless he switched AMA dockets (to Evidence Submission or Hearing).  See generally Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023). No docket switch request has been received to date.  

The Board acknowledges that this decision is being issued prior to the expiration of the period during which the Veteran may elect to switch dockets. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). While this time has not expired, the Board finds that there is no prejudice in proceeding with this claim as it is being remanded in full, and to hold this case any longer to seek clarification from the Veteran as to whether he would like to waive the remaining period would ultimately result in prejudice to him.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  As discussed above, the Board is remanding this claim; therefore, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of the cost of non-VA medical care furnished to the Veteran from October 29, 2015, to March 2, 2017

The Board has reviewed the claim file and has determined that a remand is warranted based on due process issues that frustrate the Board's ability to review this claim.

Generally, in issuing a decision on a claim for benefits, the AOJ has a statutory duty to include a summary of the applicable laws and regulations, a summary of the evidence considered, and the basis of the decision, to include, in the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 5104(b).  The Board finds itself unable to determine if the VHA properly decided all questions of law and fact necessary or provided the Veteran with an appropriate basis for any decision, to specifically include the correct identification of any elements not satisfied leading to a denial. Moreover, prior to any decision on the claim at all, the AOJ had a statutory duty to inform the Veteran of any information or evidence not previously provided to VA that was necessary to substantiate the claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103(a)(1). There is no indication that the AOJ provided any such notice. As correction of these errors by the AOJ in satisfying its regulatory and statutory duties would have at least a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the issue on appeal, the appeal must be remanded.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Issue appropriate notice to the Veteran of any information or evidence not previously provided to VA that is necessary to substantiate the claim.

2. Then, comply with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 5104 as needed.
