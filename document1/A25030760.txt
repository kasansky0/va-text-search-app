DOCKET NO. 240813-467854
DATE: April 3, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to recognition of the Appellant as the surviving spouse of the Veteran, for purposes of receiving Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) survivor benefits is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1969 to October 1986. Unfortunately, the Veteran died in December 2020. The Appellant is seeking to be recognized as his surviving spouse.

This appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arose from a July 2024 decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO).

In December 2024, the Appellant testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in a virtual hearing. A copy of the hearing transcript is of record.

As the Appellant selected the Hearing docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ decision on appeal as well as any evidence submitted by the Appellant or her representative at the hearing of within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding this claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to recognition of the Appellant as the surviving spouse of the Veteran, for purposes of receiving Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) survivor benefits is remanded.

When this matter was last before the Board in September 2022, it was remanded for the AOJ to contact the Appellant and the late Veteran's daughter to request documents relating to divorce proceedings for the Appellant and the late Veteran. 

Although some court documents related to the aforementioned divorce proceedings were submitted in February 2023 and March 2024, a Registry of Actions submitted in February 2023, indicates that there are additional divorce proceeding documents, such as a motion to modify the temporary order filed by the Appellant's attorney, which are relevant and pertinent to this appeal, that were not obtained by the AOJ prior to the issuance of the July 2024 decision on appeal herein. The Board finds the failure of the AOJ to obtain a copy of all the divorce proceeding documents prior to the issuance of the decision on appeal to be a pre-decisional duty to assist error that must be corrected on remand. Accordingly, remand is warranted to obtain copies of all the divorce proceeding documents of record.
