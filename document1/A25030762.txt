DOCKET NO. 240116-409369
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an initial 60 percent disability rating for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's GERD results in pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, arm pain, shoulder pain, sleep disturbances occurring four or more times per year, and vomiting, and the combination of these symptoms is productive of severe impairment of health.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial 60 disability rating for service-connected GERD have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1995 to March 2003.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

The increased initial rating claim has been continuously pursued through various decision review requests that culminated in an August 2023 rating decision in response to a June 2023 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application.  Thereafter, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review in August 2023.  The December 2023 rating decision on appeal was issued thereafter, considering the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 rating decision.  

In the January 204 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

As mentioned above, the Veteran has continuously pursued a higher initial disability rating for her GERD since her initial service connection claim, effective January 13, 2020.  She is currently in receipt of a 30 percent disability rating for the duration of the appeal.  See December 2023 rating decision.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3. 

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of any disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  Although the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings, the Board is to consider the Veteran's medical history in determining the applicability of a higher rating for the entire period in which the appeal has been pending.  Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31, 34 (1999). 

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous."  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).  In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time.  Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings).  When adjudicating a claim for an increased initial evaluation, the relevant time period is from the date of the claim.  Moore v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 211, 215 (2007), rev'd in irrelevant part, Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369 (2009).    

The Veteran's GERD has been evaluated under Diagnostic Code 7346, which prior to May 19, 2024, was used by analogy to rate GERD.  Effective May 19, 2024, VA amended the schedule of ratings for the digestive system and created Diagnostic Code 7206.  Because this appeal (and its review period) predates the implementation of this amendment, it is appropriate to review the Veteran's appeal with Diagnostic Code 7346, as it has been done for the duration of the claim and appeal period.  

Under Diagnostic Code 7346, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346.  A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. A maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 

Under the amended criteria, a new diagnostic code, that is, Diagnostic Code 7206, was added for GERD, which provides the same rating criteria as Diagnostic Code 7203 for stricture of the esophagus.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 19735.

Under the new Diagnostic Code 7206 for GERD, a noncompensable evaluation is assigned for documented history without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7206.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic.  Id.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilation no more than 2 times per year.  Id.  A 50 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement.  Id.  An 80 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube).  Id.

Findings must be documented by barium swallow, computerized tomography, or esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  Id. at Note 1.  Non-gastrointestinal complications of procedures should be rated under the appropriate system.  Id. at Note 2.  This diagnostic code applies to, but is not limited to, esophagitis, mechanical or chemical; Mallory Weiss syndrome (bleeding at junction of esophagus and stomach due to tears) due to caustic ingestion of alkali or acid; drug-induced or infectious esophagitis due to Candida, virus, or other organism; idiopathic eosinophilic, or lymphocytic esophagitis; esophagitis due to radiation therapy; esophagitis due to peptic stricture; and any esophageal condition that requires treatment with sclerotherapy.  Id. at Note 3.  Recurrent esophageal stricture is defined as the inability to maintain target esophageal diameter beyond 4 weeks after the target diameter has been achieved.  Id. at Note 4.  Refractory esophageal stricture is defined as the inability to achieve target esophageal diameter despite receiving no fewer than 5 dilatation sessions performed at 2-week intervals.  Id. at Note 5.

The Board notes that 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 does not define the terms "persistently recurrent" or "considerable."  The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the Board's statement of reasons or bases may be inadequate where it does not define key terms, Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018), and the Board must ensure that any ambiguous terms used in the VA regulations are properly defined when applying the VA diagnostic criteria for a particular disability.  Rivera-Colon v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 221 (2022).  The Court has discussed, and approved of, the use dictionaries such as Dorland's Medical Dictionary by the Board.  While the Court noted that dictionaries or treatises cannot properly be used to make medical determinations, the Court presumes terms carry their ordinary dictionary meaning where they are not defined in the regulation.  Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 67, 71-72 (2020).  The Court has similarly held that in discussing the meaning of terms, the Board is permitted to consult with a dictionary.  See Nielson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 56, 59 (2009) ("It is commonplace to consult dictionaries to ascertain a term's ordinary meaning."); see also Hime v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2016) (using a law dictionary to define "decision").

The revised rating criteria apply to all claims received by VA or that are pending before the AOJ on or after May 19, 2024.  Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both the old and new rating criteria and the criteria which is more favorable to the Veteran's claim(s) will be applied.  The Federal Circuit has held that the Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise.  See Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  The Board is not precluded from applying the prior version of an applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective date of the new regulations if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the claim(s) (as in this appeal).  38 U.S.C. 5110(g).  Here, the Board finds that there is no evidence of esophageal stricture, which would be required under Diagnostic Code 7206.  Thus, the Board will apply the rating criteria under Diagnostic Code 7346 which is more favorable to the Veteran.

VA has provided several VA examinations throughout the claim and appeal period.  See April 2020, August 2021, July 2022, January 2023, and July 2023 VA examinations.  The July 2023 VA examination shows the most severe symptoms (which the RO relied on in the December 2023 rating decision to award an initial 30 percent disability rating for the entire appeal period).  Specifically, the examiner noted that the Veteran's GERD results in pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, arm pain, shoulder pain, sleep disturbances occurring four or more times per year (four was the maximum number available on the questionnaire), and vomiting.  The Veteran indicated that the content of her stomach would go to her throat, creating a feeling of a lump in her throat.  She had chest pain that radiated into her shoulder, vomiting, and she suffered from nighttime choking due to regurgitation on a weekly basis.  She took Nexium and tums daily.  The examiner explained that the Veteran's GERD made it difficult to sleep, which caused fatigue.  The fatigue, in turn, caused concentration issues which made it difficult to complete tasks.   

The July 2023 VA examination is consistent with a December 2022 statement by the Veteran.  In addition to listing the same symptoms that were enumerated in the July 2023 VA examination, she reported that due to her fatigue she had difficulty concentrating, trouble thinking, mood changes, weight gain, irritability, depressed mood, frequent yawning, and a hard time staying on task and concentrating.  

In a May 2023 private opinion, P.D., an advanced practice medical nurse, considered the VA examination findings from the claim and appeal period, as well as the Veteran's lay statements, to assert that the Veteran's disability picture was productive of severe impairment of health.  She specifically considered the physical symptoms of the Veteran's classic GERD, the health related emotional, psychological and spiritual impacts on behavioral and social functions, and the development of abnormal physical structural/cellular anatomical defects with the loss of normal gastrointestinal function related to GERD.  P.D. further focused on how the Veteran's symptoms would drastically increase in severity without the use of the prescribed Nexium.  The VA examinations of record do list the medication.  For instance, the July 2023 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's Nexium helped during daytime episodes of GERD.  

The Board finds this annotation significant because in assigning a rating under DC 7346, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).  The VA examinations of record do not specifically separate the Veteran's symptoms without Nexium or tums from her symptoms with the medications.  For this reason, the Board places more weight into the May 2023 private opinion by P.D., who clearly opines that the Veteran's GERD symptoms result in severe impairment of health.  It is evident based on the private medical opinion, the July 2023 VA examination, and the Veteran's statements, that her life is significantly impacted by her GERD.  

Given the above, the Board resolves doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that an initial 60 percent disability rating is warranted for her GERD.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  In doing so, the Board acknowledges that chronic sleep impairment is noted as a symptom included in the Veteran's service-connected depression.  However, a July 2022 VA examination documents the Veteran relating her sleep impairment to physical symptoms of pain, not to her psychiatric disorder.  However, the Board has considered the whole impact of the Veteran's GERD when it finds that it results in severe impairment of health.
