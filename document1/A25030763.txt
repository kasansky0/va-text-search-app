DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for bilateral pes planus is dismissed.

Service connection for a right knee disorder is dismissed.

Service connection for a left knee disorder is dismissed.

Service connection for a right hip disorder is denied.

Service connection for a left hip disorder is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran served on active duty from July 2014 to August 2023.

2. In September 2023, the Veteran appealed an August 2023 rating decision denying service connection for bilateral pes planus and right and left knee disorders to the Board via a VA Form 10182, which was docketed as appeal number 230901-373802 and subsequently remanded by the Board in January 2025.

3. In March 2024, the Veteran again appealed the August 2023 rating decision denying service connection for bilateral pes planus and right and left knee disorders, in addition to right and left hip disorders, to the Board via a VA Form 10182, which was docketed as appeal number 240331-429667.

4. Concurrent review of the same issues in different appeal streams is not permitted; the issues of bilateral pes planus and right and left knee disorders are not properly in appeal stream 240331-429667.

5. Bilateral hip disorders or functional impairment of the hips have not been shown.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The claim of service connection for bilateral pes planus is not properly docketed and is therefore dismissed from this appeal stream. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.205 (2024).

2. The claim of service connection for a right knee disorder is not properly docketed and is therefore dismissed from this appeal stream. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.205 (2024).

3. The claim of service connection for a left knee disorder is not properly docketed and is therefore dismissed from this appeal stream. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.205 (2024).

4. A right hip disorder was not incurred in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303 (2024).

5. A left hip disorder was not incurred in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

This decision has been written under the guidelines of the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). In August 2023, the AOJ denied the claim. In September 2023, the Veteran appealed the pes planus and knee claims to the Board via a Form 10182 and elected the Direct Review docket. In March 2024, the Veteran appealed the pes planus, knee, and hip claims to the Board via a second Form 10182 and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Dismissal of Bilateral Pes Planus and Knee Disorders 

Turning to the relevant laws and regulations, the Board may not exercise concurrent review of the same claim. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). Errors in submitting concurrent appeals claims constitute defects in compliance with "claims-processing rules" which are a type of procedural defect as opposed to a jurisdictional bar. When such errors occur, any improperly docketed claims must be dismissed.

The Veteran's first VA Form 10182 appeal to the Board dated in September 2023 was docketed by the Board in September 2023 only on the issues of bilateral pes planus and bilateral knee disorders and was docketed as AMA number 230901-373802. The Board remanded these appeals in January 2025. 

The second VA Form 10182 appeal to the Board dated in March 2024 was docketed by the Board in April 2024 and again included the issues of pes planus, bilateral knee disorders, but also included the bilateral hip disorders and was docketed as AMA number 240331-429667. 

As the issues of bilateral pes planus and bilateral knee disorders were already a part of docket number 230901-373802, they were improperly placed on docket number 240331-429667 due to a procedural defect and accordingly are dismissed from the current appeal stream. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d). This decision has no impact on the development of the appeals for bilateral pes planus and bilateral knee disorders currently in remand status under docket number 230901-373802. 

Service Connection for Bilateral Hip Disorders

Turning to the relevant laws and regulations, service connection may be granted on a direct basis as a result of disease or injury incurred in service using a three-element test: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a), (d); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Service connection may only be granted for a current disability; when a claimed condition is not shown, there may be no grant of service connection. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141 (1992). However, pain alone can constitute a disability if it results in functional impairment. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

Turning to the medical evidence, the service treatment records (STRs) show treatment for right hip pain in November 2018, described as dull to achy to sharp, depending upon usage and decreased flexion and abduction due to such pain. A December 2018 clinician noted that the hip pain originated from a hike that occurred years prior and that the right hip only bothered the Veteran when load bearing. 

The Veteran underwent a VA general medical separation examination in February 2019, although he subsequently reenlisted. Nonetheless, at that time, the examiner diagnosed right hip sacroiliitis based on X-rays from earlier that month. The examiner found that the Veteran experienced functional loss or impairment due to not being able to bear as much weight as he previously could; however, range of motion measurements were normal and there was no pain noted on the examination. The examiner found that the disorder impacted the Veteran's ability to sit or stand for prolonged periods of time. 

In July 2019, a clinician noted that the Veteran's bilateral anterior thigh/hip flexors had tight myofascial bands. The right side was tender and the left side was only tender with aggressive palpitation. There was no pain with sartorius loading and minimal pain with heavily resisted straight leg raises at 45 degrees. 

In January 2022, the Veteran received treatment for dull right hip pain that had been present for 2 to 3 months, was more prevalent at the end of the day when idle, and was accompanied by popping when walking downhill every other step or more. He reported right hip pain level as 0 out of 10, but 5 out of 10 with activity. He also reported clicking in the right hip and treated the disorder with Tylenol and a massage gun. A January 2022 clinician noted the Veteran's hip pain as having been resolved with trigger point dry needling (TDN). 

A September 2022 clinician noted that the Veteran's internal and external bilateral hip rotation was normal. Similarly, a January 2023 clinician noted normal bilateral hip flexion and extension strength. At the March 2023 service separation examination, the Veteran self-reported pain in the ankles and knees and the lower extremities were found to be abnormal but it was not attributed to the hips. 

Similarly, at a March 2023 VA General Medical - Separation Health Assessment, the Veteran reported joint pain in the lower extremities; however, a physical examination of the lower extremities was normal and there was no diagnosis related to the hips.

At a March 2023 VA Hip and Thigh Conditions examination, the Veteran reported that the disorder began in 2014 when he had torn both hip flexors during a hike and torn them again in 2017. The current symptoms included constant pain in the front of the hips and popping in the right hip with limited mobility which impacted the Veteran's ability to run on flat ground or walk uphill, flare ups of both hips, and that the disorder was treated with stretching. 

Importantly, however, the examiner found that the Veteran likely did not experience pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination that significantly limited the functional ability of either hip during flare-ups. No ankylosis or atrophy was noted and the range of motion was normal. Based upon such findings, the examiner concluded that the Veteran did not have a diagnosed disorder and was not unable to perform any type of occupational task. 

Accordingly, while a February 2019 medical examiner diagnosed right hip sacroiliitis, the right hip disorder was found to have subsequently resolved and there was no evidence of such disorder during the appeal period. As there are no confirmed current diagnoses of right or left hip disorders and no evidence of functional impairment, the medical evidence does not support service connection.

The Board has considered the lay statements that the hip disorders are related to service. He is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses, but he is not otherwise competent to diagnose a disability or its etiology.

Such competent evidence concerning the nature and cause of the Veteran's disorders has been provided by the medical personnel who have examined him.  The medical findings (as provided in the examination reports and other medical evidence) directly address the nature and cause of the Veteran's disorders.  

Moreover, as the examiner has the requisite medical expertise to render medical opinions regarding the etiology and degree of impairment caused by the disorders  and had sufficient facts and data on which to base the conclusion, the Board affords the medical opinions great probative value. As such, these medical records are more probative than the Veteran's subjective statements and assertions.  

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, for the Board's consideration.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
