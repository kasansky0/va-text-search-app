DOCKET NO. 250220-522959
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 10, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty with the United States Marine Corps from November 1976 to May 1980.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals on appeal from a February 2025 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in this matter.

In a February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  The Veteran resubmitted his VA Form 10182 in March 2025 and again elected the Direct Review Docket.  However, shortly thereafter, also in March 2025, the Veteran submitted a written statement requesting to withdraw his appeal.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  Here, the Veteran's withdrawal was in writing and included his name, applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
