DOCKET NO. 230925-379004
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The claim for entitlement to additional dependency benefits for the Veteran's spouse, D.P., is dismissed as moot.  

FINDING OF FACT

In a February 2024 notification, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted the Veteran's claim for additional dependency benefits for his spouse, D.P.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There being no remaining justiciable case or controversy with respect to the claim of entitlement to additional dependency benefits for the Veteran's spouse, D.P., the appeal as to this issue is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1972 to October 1980. He has additional service with the National Guard.

In the September 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The claim for entitlement to additional dependency benefits for the Veteran's spouse, D.P., is dismissed as moot.  

The Veteran appealed to the Board the June 2023 notification which denied entitlement to additional dependency benefits for the Veteran's spouse, D.P. However, while his appeal was pending, the AOJ granted entitlement to additional dependency benefits in a February 2024 decision. 

Therefore, the Board finds that because the February 2024 rating decision effectively replaces the decision from which the Veteran appeals and because such decision represents a full grant of the available benefit with respect to the claim for dependency benefits for D.P., there remains no justiciable case or controversy with respect to this appeal. Accordingly, the appeal is moot and must be dismissed. See, e.g., Ramsey v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 223, 224-225 (2006); Bond v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 376, 377 (1992) (When the relief sought has been accomplished, the appropriate course of action is to dismiss the matter as moot).

The Board notes that the Veteran has also appealed the effective date assigned in the February 2024 decision. This appeal will be addressed in a separate, forthcoming decision.
