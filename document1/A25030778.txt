ORDER

Service connection for prostate cancer is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's prostate cancer is related to an in-service event.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for prostate cancer have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Air Force from June 1965 to November 1968.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is granted.

The Veteran generally contends that his prostate cancer is related to his military service. See August 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, including malignant tumors, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Veteran's service treatment records do not reflect any complaints or treatment related to prostate cancer. The evidence of record reflects that the Veteran was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2024, more than a year after his separation from service. Thus, the requirements for presumptive service connection are not met.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

In the September 2024 rating decision, the AOJ conceded toxic exposure based on the Veteran's military occupation of fuel specialist and found that the Veteran has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Concerning element three of direct service connection, there are probative opinions in favor of and against the claim.

The evidence against the claim includes a September 2024 VA opinion in which the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's current prostate cancer was less likely than not caused by his toxic exposure risk activities. In support of the opinion, the VA examiner relied on a study from the National Library of Medicine that found exposure to high doses of jet fuels can lead to skin tumors. However, the data was insufficient to reach a conclusion concerning the carcinogenicity of inhaled jet fuel and whether it is associated with an increased incidence of various types of cancers. The opinion indicated that the committee who completed the study had recommended that the Department of Defense follow a cohort of military personnel to determine if there is any association. 

The evidence in favor of the claim includes a December 2024 private opinion in which the private physician opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's prostate cancer is secondary to jet fuel exposure. In support of the opinion, the private physician noted dioxins and benzene are present in jet fuels, although not intentionally added they are formed as unintentional byproducts of industrial processes. In addition, evidence shows that dioxin can cause damage at the DNA level and lead to cancer. Although there are other risk factors for prostate cancer, dioxin itself is a strong risk factor. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds these opinions to be entitled to equal weight of probative value, as they both considered the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activities and applicable medical literature and provided a rationale for the conclusions reached. As such, the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's current prostate cancer is related to his service. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for prostate cancer is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
