ORDER

The overpayment of educational assistance benefits under the Transfer of Entitlement (TOE) provisions of Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (known as the Post-9/11 GI Bill), to include in the amounts of $7,176 and $1,291.67, were not validly created. The appeal is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

All overpayments created as a result of the TOE provisions were not validly created.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The debt created by the overpayment of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits in the amounts of $7,176 and $1,291.67, and any other amounts created from the TOE provisions, are not valid. 38 U.S.C. § 5302 ; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.7136, 21.7144.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 2008 to August 2008, from January 2009 to September 2010, from July 2014 to July 2015, and from September 2016 to March 2021. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the March 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Whether the overpayment of payment of educational assistance benefits under the TOE provisions of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, to include in the amounts of $7,176 and $1,291.67, was validly created

While the Veteran was in service, he successfully applied to transfer his education benefits to his dependents on March 11, 2019, with an obligated end of duty date of March 9, 2023. The Veteran contends that he was discharged from service prior to his obligated end of duty date due to a disability. Therefore, the veteran argues that the overpayment amounts generated as a result of his transfer of entitlement of education benefits were not validly created. 

In the instant appeal, in September 2020, a Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) found that the Veteran was physically unfit and recommended that the Veteran be separated from the military. The PEB stated that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type II was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, not due to intentional misconduct, willful neglect, or unauthorized absence, and is permanent and stable. 

Furthermore, in response to the September 2020 PEB finding, the Veteran submitted an October 2020 appeal stating that he elected to be transferred to the Retired Reserve in lieu of being separated for a disability with entitlement to disability severance pay. This appears to be reflected on the Veteran's Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214). The Veteran's DD Form 214 does not indicate that the Veteran was separated for a disability.

Relevant to the issue on appeal, the law provides that the Secretary of Defense or, in this case, the Secretary of the Army, may approve a member of the Armed Forces who is entitled to basic educational assistance under Chapter 33, under certain circumstances, to elect to transfer to one or more dependents the unused portion of entitlement to such assistance. 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (a). To be eligible to transfer educational assistance benefits, a transferor must have served six years on active duty or in the Selected Reserve at the time of his approval by the Secretary of the Army and must have entered into an agreement to serve at least four more years as a member of the Armed Forces, or the years of service as determined in regulations pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (j). 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (b).

The law further provides that if an individual transferring entitlement under 38 U.S.C. § 3319 fails to complete the service agreed to in accordance with the terms of the agreement under 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (b)(1), the amount of any transferred entitlement under this section that is used by a dependent of the individual as of the date of such failure shall be treated as an overpayment of educational assistance. 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (i)(2)(A). In the event of an overpayment of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits with respect to a dependent to whom entitlement is transferred, the dependent and the individual making the transfer shall be jointly and severally liable for the amount of the overpayment. 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (i)(1).

Exceptions however exist and subparagraph (A) will not apply in the case of an individual who fails to complete service agreed to by the individual (1) by reason of the death of the individual or (2) for a reason referred to in 38 U.S.C. § 3311(c)(4). 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (i)(2)(B). In accordance with 38 U.S.C. § 3311(c)(4), if the individual transferring entitlement fails to complete the service agreed to due to early discharge or release from active duty for (1) a medical condition which preexisted the applicable period of service of the individual and which the Secretary determines is not service-connected; (2) hardship; or (3) a physical or mental condition that was not characterized as a disability and did not result from the individual's own willful misconduct but did interfere with the individual's performance of duty, as determined by the Secretary concerned in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, an overpayment of education assistance benefits will not be assessed. 38 U.S.C. § 3311 (c)(4); 38 C.F.R. § 21.9570 (l)(1)(i). Additionally, a transferor is considered to have completed his or her service agreement as a result of being discharged for a disability or a reduction in force. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9570 (l)(1)(ii).

Here, the Board finds that the evidence of record demonstrates that although the Veteran failed to complete his agreed service, he did so due to a physical condition that interfered with his performance of duty, that did not result from his own willful misconduct. See 38 U.S.C. § 3311 (c)(4). Therefore, the overpayment of educational assistance benefits under the Transfer of Entitlement (TOE) provisions of Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (known as the Post-9/11 GI Bill), to include in the amounts of $7,176 and $1,291.67, were not validly created and the appeal is granted.
