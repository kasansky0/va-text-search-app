ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is denied. 

Entitlement to survivors' pension benefits is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran's cause of death was related to her service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to include major depressive disorder, cannabis use, and insomnia. 

2. The Appellant's countable income exceeds the maximum annual pension rate (MAPR) for a surviving child.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1310, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.5, 3.312.

2. The criteria for entitlement to survivors' pension benefits based on the surviving child's countable income have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1542; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.3, 3.21, 3.24, 3.57, 3.271, 3.272, 3.273, 3.278.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 2007 to August 2012.  During her period of service, she earned the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with three (3) Campaign Stars, Army Commendation Medal (Third Award), Army Achievement Medal (Second Award), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Award, Meritorious Unit Commendation, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with two (2) Campaign Stars, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon (Second Award), NATO Medal, Combat Medical Badge, Marksmanship Badge with Rifle Bar, and Driver and Mechanic Badge with Driver-Wheeled Vehicle(s) Clasp.  The Veteran died in February 2022.  The Appellant is her surviving minor child.  The Appellant's custodian is her father.  See Birth Certificate, received May 11, 2022.

In the March 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

In January 2025, the Board informed the Appellant, through her custodian and representative, that she had submitted additional documents with her July 2022 VA Form 10182 and advised her that any additional evidence submitted could not be considered by the Board because she had selected the Direct Review docket.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  In accordance with Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023), she was advised that if she wanted the Board to consider any additional evidence, she must change her Board appeal request by switching AMA dockets to Evidence submission or Hearing docket.  See AMA Notification Letter, dated January 29, 2025.  The Board explained the requirements for the Appellant to switch dockets.  She did not respond to the Board's letter.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Appellant does not wish to switch AMA dockets and that she understands that with her appeal remaining in the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 decision on appeal.

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death

Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits are payable to the surviving spouse, children, and parents of a veteran who dies from a service-connected or compensable disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1310.  A veteran's death will be considered as being due to a service-connected disability when the evidence establishes that the service-connected disability was either the principal or a contributory cause of death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312(a).  

In order to establish service connection for the cause of a veteran's death, the evidence must show that a disability incurred in or aggravated by active military service either caused or contributed substantially or materially to the veteran's demise.  To constitute the principal cause of death, the service-connected disability must be one of the immediate or underlying causes of death or be etiologically related to the cause of death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312(b).  To be a contributory cause of death, it must be shown that the service-connected disability contributed substantially or materially to cause death; that it combined to cause death; or that it aided or lent assistance to the production of death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312(c).  It is not sufficient to show that the service-connected disability casually shared in producing death, but rather it must be shown that there was a causal connection between the service-connected disability and a veteran's death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312(c)(1).

In determining whether service connection for cause of death is warranted, the laws and regulations generally applicable to compensation for service-connected disability apply.  38 U.S.C. § 1310.  To that end, under the relevant laws and regulations, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.  Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 U.S.C. § 5103(a).

A death certificate associated with the record indicates that the Veteran died in February 2022.  The immediate cause of death was listed as immediate severe trauma.  The manner of death was noted to be an accident.  At the time of her death in February 2022, the Veteran was service connected for PTSD, to include major depressive disorder, cannabis use, and insomnia.  The Board initially notes that the Appellant, through her custodian, does not contend, and the evidence does not demonstrate, that the Veteran's severe trauma was incurred in or aggravated by the Veteran's active service.  Rather, the Appellant contends that the Veteran's PTSD, to include major depressive disorder, cannabis use, and insomnia contributed substantially or materially to the cause of death listed on the Veteran's death certificate.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(c).

A review of the Veteran's VA treatment records reveals four mental health hospitalizations in 2021.  See CAPRI, dated July 1, 2022, pp. 2, 21, 76-77, 80, 95, 103, 121, 154.  Prior to her death, the Veteran appeared for a VA PTSD examination in August 2021.  At that time, she denied suicidal ideation; however, she reported there was not much to live for.  She endorsed feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, depressed mood, lower social interest, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, loss of energy, and anxiety.  She also denied any immediate plans to harm herself or others.  The Veteran expressed awareness of the VA Crisis Hotline.  

After considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board concludes that service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is not warranted.  The Board acknowledges a statement submitted in March 2023 by the Appellant's custodian in which he stated that the Veteran expressed she would "jump in front of a moving truck to kill herself."  See Correspondence, received March 15, 2023.  However, neither the Appellant nor her custodian have the medical training and expertise to adequately evaluate how the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms would impact her behavior.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  As noted above, other than an unsupported statement by the Appellant's custodian that the Veteran had expressed suicidal thoughts, there is no probative evidence submitted during the evidentiary window that PTSD, to include major depressive disorder, cannabis use, and insomnia contributed substantially or materially to the Veteran's death.  Moreover, the Board finds that there is also no probative evidence submitted during the evidentiary window that the Veteran's manner of death was other than an accident.  

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence in this case does not reach the level of equipoise.  Unfortunately, the claim of entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the persuasive evidence of record weighs against the Appellant's claim, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board emphasizes that it is very sympathetic to the Appellant's claim.  Unfortunately, as explained above, by law the evidence submitted by the Appellant's custodian after issuance of the July 2022 rating decision could not be considered by the Board in making a decision at this time.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.302.  The Appellant is again encouraged to file a supplemental claim to allow the AOJ to issue another decision in consideration of such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

2. Entitlement to survivors' pension benefits

Survivors' pension benefits are generally available for surviving child as a result of the veteran's nonservice-connected death.  38 U.S.C. § 1541(a).  Basic entitlement exists if (i) the veteran served for 90 days or more during a period of war; or (ii) was, at the time of death, receiving or entitled to receive compensation or retirement pay for a service-connected disability, and (iii) the surviving child meets the net worth requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.274 and has an annual income not in excess of the maximum annual pension rate (MAPR) specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.23.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.3(b)(4).

For VA purposes, the term "child" means an unmarried person who is a legitimate child, a legally adopted child, a stepchild who was a member of the veteran's household at the time of death, or an illegitimate child (acknowledged by the veteran either in writing or via court ordered child support) of the veteran; and is under the age of 18 years; or before reaching the age of 18 years became permanently incapable of self-support; or after reaching the age of 18 years and until completion of education or training (but not after reaching the age of 23 years) is pursuing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution.  38 U.S.C. § 101(4); 38 C.F.R. § 3.57.

The MAPR is published in Appendix BVA Manual M21-1 (M21-1) and is to be given the same force and effect as if published in VA regulations.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.21, 3.24.  The MAPR is revised every December 1st and is applicable for the following 12-month period.  The MAPR shall be reduced by the amount of the countable annual income of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1521; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.3, 3.23(b).

In determining annual income, all payments of any kind or from any source (including salary, retirement or annuity payments, or similar income, which has been waived) shall be included during the 12-month annualization period in which received, except for listed exclusions.  38 U.S.C. § 1503(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.271(a).  Income from the Social Security Administration (SSA) is not specifically excluded under 38 C.F.R. § 3.272.  Such income is therefore included as countable income.

For purposes of calculating pension benefits, total income may be reduced by amounts equal to amounts paid by a claimant for unreimbursed medical expenses that were "in excess of five percent of the applicable maximum annual pension rate or rates... as in effect during the 12-month annualization period in which the medical expenses were paid."  38 C.F.R. § 3.272(g)(1)(iii).

In order to be excluded from income, these medical expenses must be paid during the time period at issue, regardless of when they were incurred.  In addition, they must be out-of-pocket expenses, for which the surviving child received no reimbursement, such as through an insurance company.  However, the medical insurance premiums themselves, as well as the Medicare deduction, may be applied to reduce countable income.

For the purpose of determining initial entitlement, or resuming payments on an award that was previously discontinued, the monthly rate of pension shall be computed by reducing the applicable maximum pension rate by the countable income on the effective date of entitlement and dividing the remainder by twelve.  38 C.F.R. § 3.273(a).

In essence, VA subtracts the total amount of countable income in one year, less excluded income, from the MAPR for that year; then, if a positive amount remains, the rest is divided by twelve to determine the monthly death pension benefit.  When a change in the MAPR occurs, the Board repeats the calculation with the new MAPR as the starting amount.  38 C.F.R. § 3.273(b)(1).  When a change in income occurs, the MAPR will be reduced by the new annualized income effective on the date that the increased income began.  38 C.F.R. § 3.273(b)(2).

After a review of the evidentiary record, the Board finds that the Appellant's countable income exceeds the maximum allowable income for survivors' pension.

The MAPR for a surviving child was $2,523.00, effective December 1, 2021.

In her May 2022 VA Form 21P-534EZ (Application for DIC, Survivors Pension, and/or Accrued Benefits), the Appellant reported receiving no income.  A June 2022 SSA Inquiry shows that monthly benefits were paid to the Appellant at a rate of $1,341.00 per month (or $16,092.00 annually), effective the month of the Veteran's death.  See SSA Profile and Benefit Data, received June 27, 2022.  Therefore, the Appellant had an annualized SSA income of $16,092.00 in 2022, which exceeds the MAPR for a surviving child.

Accordingly, the undisputed facts in this case establish the Appellant's countable annual income exceeds the MAPR for a surviving child.  The payment of VA survivors' pension benefits to those whose countable income exceeds statutory limits is prohibited.  Although the Board is sympathetic to the Appellant's claim, based upon the application of existing law to the evidence, the Board must conclude that the Appellant is not legally entitled to VA survivors' pension benefits.  As such, the claim of entitlement to survivors' pension benefits must be denied as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
