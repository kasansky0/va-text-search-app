ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a neck disability is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for service-connected pseudofolliculitis barbae is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a neck disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The most probative evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae resulted in a skin condition that affected at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body, or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or, intermittent systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than six weeks during the past 12-month period. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a neck disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for service-connected pseudofolliculitis barbae have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7820.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 2013 to October 2013, with additional service in the Mississippi National Guard and Air Force Reserve. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Veteran elected the Board's Direct Review docket. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. This restricts the Board's review to the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that evidence was associated with the claims file after the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, which was during a period of time that is outside the applicable evidentiary window. Therefore, the Board has not considered that evidence in its present decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300(a). If the Veteran would like VA to consider the additional evidence that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and identify the evidence for the AOJ's consideration. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. However, as the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a back disability is being remanded, the AOJ will consider the claim in light of the entire claims file upon remand.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a neck disability is denied.

The Veteran contends that his claimed neck disability was caused by service. Specifically, the Veteran claims that while working in civil engineering, he suffered an accident which aggravated his neck. See February 2023 VA 21-526EZ.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Further, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the evidence is not in approximate balance and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

Upon review of the claims file, the Board is persuaded that the medical evidence does not reflect that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a neck disability and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Board understands that the Veteran did not undergo a VA examination of his neck during the applicable appeal period. VA must provide a medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) there is insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5103 (d)(2), 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4)(i).

Here, the Board notes that although the Veteran reported suffering a neck injury, prior to the rating decision on appeal, the evidence of record does not contain medical evidence of a currently diagnosed neck disability or even lay evidence of current recurrent symptoms of a neck disability. See generally Mclendon, 20 Vet. App. 79; see also Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (noting when pain produces functional impairment of earning capacity, it can be considered a disability for service connection). Thus, VA's duty-to-assist to provide the Veteran a VA examination of his claimed neck disability was not triggered. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103 (d)(2), 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4)(i).

While the Veteran believes he has a current diagnosis of a neck disability, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education, knowledge of the interaction between multiple organ systems in the body, and the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a neck disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. As there is no evidence that the Veteran currently has a neck disability, a required element of a claim for service connection has not been established and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82. Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for a neck disability must be denied at this time. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) ("In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim.").

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for service-connected pseudofolliculitis barbae is denied.

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. The Board has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).

For claims for increase of initial ratings, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). If later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, "staged" ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability should be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In a March 2024 rating decision, entitlement to service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae was granted with a noncompensable disability rating under DC 7820, effective October 3, 2023. See March 2024 Rating Decision Codesheet. The Veteran is appealing this initial evaluation and generally asserts that his service-connected skin condition is more severe than his current rating reflects. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. 

The General Rating Formula for the Skin applies to DCs 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Under this formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected. A 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period. A 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period. A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period. Or rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DCs 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating for the Skin for DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824.

VA regulations explicitly state that systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 (a).

The Veteran underwent a VA skin diseases examination in February 2024. Upon examination, the Veteran reported that his condition has stayed the same since his separation from service, and he still experiences itchiness, burning sensation, pimples, and redness after shaving. The February 2024 VA skin diseases examination report reflects that found that the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae had not been treated with medications, treatments, or procedures in the past 12 months. Further, visible characteristic lesions, here razor bumps on the Veteran's face and chin, covered less than 5 percent of the Veteran's total body area and less than 5 percent of the exposed area. Moreover, the examiner noted the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae does not cause scarring or disfigurement of the Veteran's head, face, or neck. There is no contrary evidence of record.

Furthermore, available private treatment records are silent as to treatment for pseudofolliculitis barbae throughout the appeal period. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under regulations because the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae does not more nearly approximate (1) characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or (2) at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or (3) intermittent systemic therapy required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects. The Veteran is competent to report what he observed. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). However, he does not assert, and medical treatment records do not show, that the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae more nearly approximated the criteria required for the next higher rating.

The Board has considered whether any other DCs related to disabilities of the skin would provide for a higher disability evaluation. However, the evidence does not reflect that the pseudofolliculitis barbae would warrant a higher rating under a different diagnostic code. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for pseudofolliculitis barbae. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his back and neck disabilities are due to a motor vehicle accident during service. See September and December 2023 VA 21-526EZ. Specifically, in the September 2023 VA 21-526EZ, the Veteran contends that he was in a motor vehicle accident while under Active Guard Reserve (AGR) Orders. 

The Board notes that a February 2016 service treatment record reflects that the Veteran reported he was treated for back pain and prescribed medication after a motor vehicle accident a week prior. 

Eligibility for VA benefits, such as service connection, is governed by statutory and regulatory law which defines an individual's legal status as a veteran of active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (2), 101(24); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.6. 

"Active military, naval, or air service" includes any period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred in line of duty. 38 U.S.C. § 101 (24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (a). ACDUTRA is full-time duty in the Armed Forces performed by Reserves for training purposes or by members of the National Guard of any state. 38 U.S.C. § 101 (22); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (c). Active military, naval, or air service also includes any period of inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA) during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty or from an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebral vascular accident occurring during such training. 38 U.S.C. § 101 (24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (a). INACDUTRA means duty other than full-time duty prescribed for Reserves or the National Guard of any state. 38 U.S.C. § 101 (23); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (d).

National Guard duty is different from other Reserve service in that a member of the National Guard may be called to duty by the governor of their state. Members of the National Guard only serve the federal military when they are formally called into the military service of the United States. At all other times, National Guard members serve solely as members of the State militia under the command of a state governor. Allen v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 54, 57 (2007). Therefore, to have basic eligibility for Veterans benefits based on a period of duty as a member of a state National Guard, a National Guardsman must have been: (1) been ordered into federal service by the President of the United States; (2) performed "full-time duty" under the provisions of 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505; or (3) ordered to ACDUTRA under 10 U.S.C. § 12301 (d). 10 U.S.C. § 12401. 

In other words, when a claim is based on a period of Reserve or National Guard service, it must be shown that the individual concerned became disabled as a result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty on Reserve ACDUTRA/INACDUTRA or during Federalized National Guard service. In the absence of such evidence, the period of ACDUTRA would not qualify as "active military, naval, or air service" and the claimant would not achieve veteran status for purposes of that claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 101.

Regrettably, the Board finds that a remand is necessary for further development to correct a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error. The Board finds that it is necessary to corroborate the Veteran's service dates, as the AOJ determined his active service to be from February 2013 to October 2013, but the Veteran claims that he served under AGR orders when he sustained injuries in a motor vehicle collision. At this time, the Board is unable to determine whether the reported 2016 motor vehicle collision occurred during a period of inactive service, AGR, active duty for training (ACDUTRA), or inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA). On remand, the AOJ should take appropriate action to obtain a list and verify all periods of the Veteran's National Guard and Reserve service.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Verify and specifically enumerate (month, day, year) all periods of active duty while the Veteran was in the Mississippi National Guard and Air Force Reserve. Contact all appropriate sources in order to verify these dates, including if necessary, a request should be made to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). 

All verified dates of service, as well as requests and responses received should be documented in the claims file. If the records are unavailable because they have been irretrievably lost or destroyed, it should be so noted in the record (with the scope of the search described). The Veteran should be so notified and asked to submit copies of all additional service records he may have in his possession. 

Prepare a formal finding memorandum detailing dates of active service, including service in the Active Guard Reserve (AGR), ACDUTRA, and INACDUTRA.
