REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1980 to April 1983.

The matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The rating decision on appeal constitute an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

Historically, a January 2022 rating decision denied service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. In August 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2022 decision. In September 2022, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. In February 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision and continued to deny the Veteran's service connection claims for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and requested review of a February 2023 decision. In March 2023, the AOJ issued a HLR rating decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2023 decision. The AOJ decision granted service connection for bilateral lower extremity sciatic nerves and left lower extremity femoral nerve and assigned 20 percent ratings for each of the three nerves, effective from December 7, 2021, the date of the original claim for service connection.

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and requested review of the prior March 2023 decision relevant to the effective date assigned as well as the initial ratings assigned. In October 2023, the AOJ issued a HLR rating decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2023 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). There, the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). In this case, a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) as it is more than one year from the date that the AOJ mailed notice of the decision on appeal, and it is more than 60 days of the date that the Board received the March 2024 VA Form 10182. 

Finally, the Board is cognizant of the Court's holding in Edwards v. McDonough that new evidence submitted with a VA Form 10182 on which the Direct Review option is selected creates uncertainty as to which Board review option the claimant intended, triggering the Board's duty to seek clarification under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f). Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023). The Court reasoned, in-part, that consideration must be given to the "full context within which [veterans'] submissions are made" including liberally construing the filings of pro se claimants. Id. (citing Rivera v. Shinseki, 654 F.3d 1377, 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011)). Here, new evidence was not submitted with the March 2024 VA Form 10182. Rather, the evidence submitted was already of record before the AOJ's decision. Therefore, the Board shall proceed with adjudication.

Effective Date Criteria

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim or a claim reopened after final disallowance, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an award of service connection shall be the day following the date of discharge or release if application is received within one year from such date of discharge or release. Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

To preserve an effective date, an intent to file a claim may be submitted to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, appropriate to the benefit sought within one-year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

The law provides that, where compensation is awarded pursuant to any Act or administrative issue, the effective date shall not be earlier than the effective date of such Act or administrative issue. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g). If compensation is awarded pursuant to a liberalizing law, or a liberalizing VA issue approved by the Secretary, the effective date of such award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the act or administrative issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

With regard to compensation for disabilities for which service connection was granted on a secondary basis, the effective date can be no earlier than the date of the claim for service connection on a secondary basis. Ellington v. Nicholson, 22 Vet. App. 141, 145 (2007) (finding that the effective date for a grant of service connection for diabetes and hypertension as secondary to leukemia was the date of the claim for secondary service connection, not the date of the claim of service connection for leukemia), aff'd sub nom. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2008); Ross v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 528, 532-33 (2008) (holding that the effective date for a grant of secondary service connection for depression with anxiety was the date of the secondary service connection claim, not the date of the claim for service connection for the primary heart condition).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 7, 2021 for the award of service connection of left lower extremity (femoral nerve) radiculopathy is denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 7, 2021 for the award of service connection of left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) radiculopathy is denied.

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 7, 2021 for the award of service connection of right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) radiculopathy is denied.

The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date of August 19, 2021 for the award of service connection for right and left lower extremity radiculopathy is warranted. The Veteran's representative argues that August 19, 2021 should be the effective date for the awards of service connection as it is the date the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim.  See March 2024 statement submitted with the VA Form 10182.

On August 19, 2021, the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim for compensation.  Within a year of the intent to file a claim, on October 20, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940. In conjunction with the claim, the Veteran failed to report to a lumbar spine VA examination scheduled on October 26, 2021. On December 7, 2021, the Veteran submitted a formal claim for service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy as secondary to a back condition. The March 2023 rating decision granted service connection for left lower extremity femoral radiculopathy, left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and assigned and effective date of December 7, 2021, the date of the claim for service connection. These basic facts are not in dispute.

The AOJ found in a subsequent October 2023 rating decision that the October 20, 2021, VA Form 21-8940 (unemployability claim) subsumed the August 2021 intent to file claim for compensation and that an earlier effective date for the awards of service connection for left lower extremity femoral radiculopathy, left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy. The Board agrees.

The Board notes that under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1) only one complete claim for a benefit (e.g. compensation, pension) may be associated with each intent to file a claim for that benefit, though multiple issues may be contained within a complete claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1). In the event multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within one year of an intent to file a claim for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim. Id.

VA's commentary in the publication of the regulation in the Federal Register reiterates those provisions:

VA also makes clear that only one complete claim for a particular benefit may be associated with each intent to file a claim for that same benefit for purposes of this special effective date rule. In other words, if a claimant files one intent to file a claim for compensation, and then files two or more successive complete claims for compensation within one year, only issues contained within the first complete claim would relate back to the intent to file a claim for effective date purposes. There is no limit on the number of issues or conditions in each complete claim. Accordingly, it is in claimants' best interests to claim all potential issues under a particular benefit in one comprehensive package. 79 Fed. Reg. 57660, 57669 (September 25, 2014).

The Board notes that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1) as in effect prior to February 19, 2019, are now contained verbatim in current 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii) (2024).

As previously discussed, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940 on October 20, 2021, within a year of his August 2021, intent to file a claim.  The Veteran failed, without good cause, to report to an October 2021 VA lumbar spine examination in conjunction with the claim for unemployability.  The Board notes that evidence expected from the examination, which might have been material to the outcome of the claim, could not be considered. The Board observes that a February 2021 VA examination report, obtained prior to the scheduled October 2021 VA examination, as well as prior to the Veteran's December 2021 formal claim for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, documented that no radiculopathy of either extremity was present. 

The Veteran filed an initial claim for service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy as secondary to a back condition on December 7, 2021. The March 2023 AOJ decision granted service connection for left lower extremity femoral radiculopathy, left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and assigned and effective date of December 7, 2021, the date of the claim for service connection.

As the intent to file submitted on August 19, 2021 was followed by the filing in October 2021 of the claim for unemployability that did not include bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, it could not apply to the claim for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy that was subsequently filed on December 7, 2021. As discussed, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1), "[o]nly one complete claim for a benefit (e.g. compensation, pension) may be associated with each intent to file a claim for that benefit," and "[i]n the event multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within 1 year of an intent to file a claim for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim." Id. Thus, as the October 2021 claim was the first claim filed after the August 19, 2021 intent to file, only that claim may be associated with the intent to file. See Id. Thus, the subsequent claim for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy filed on December 7, 2021, may not be associated with the August 2021 intent to file. Moreover, as noted above, the Veteran was scheduled for an October 2021 VA examination for his service-connected lumbosacral strain, in conjunction with his unemployability claim, for which he failed, without good cause, to appear. As previously discussed, evidence from the examination might have been material to the outcome of the claim, could not be considered.

As the August 2021 intent to file may not be associated with the claim for service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy as secondary to the Veteran's lumbosacral strain, this claim is not considered to have been filed on the date of that intent to file; therefore, earlier effective date of service connection may not be assigned based on the August 2021 intent to file.

Accordingly, the Board finds that an effective date prior to December 7, 2021 for the awards service connection for left lower extremity femoral radiculopathy, left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy is not warranted. The appeals are denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.

Increased Rating Criteria

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. It is permissible to switch diagnostic codes to reflect more accurately a claimant's current symptoms. See Read v. Shinseki, 651 F. 3d 1296, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2011).

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Although a rating specialist is directed to review the recorded history of a disability in order to make a more accurate evaluation, see 38 C.F.R. § 4.2, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). With a claim for an increased initial rating, separate staged ratings may be assigned based on facts found. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. Therefore, the Board has considered the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the veteran, as well as the entire history of the veteran's disability in reaching its decision. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. Pyramiding, the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when rating a veteran's service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. It is possible for a veteran to have separate and distinct manifestations from the same injury which would permit rating under several diagnostic codes, however, the critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the conditions is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

The basis of disability evaluation is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no obligation to discuss, in detail, the extensive evidence of record. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that the Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence). Therefore, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as it relates to the Veteran's claims.

4.  Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (femoral nerve) is denied.

5.  Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) is denied.

6.  Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) is denied.

The Veteran generally contends that his radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities warrant higher ratings. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. Indeed, his representative indicates that the lower extremities are more severe than the current ratings assigned.

Under Diagnostic Code 8520, a 10 percent rating is assigned for mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, a 20 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis, a 40 percent rating is assigned for moderately severe incomplete paralysis, and a 60 percent rating is assigned for severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscular atrophy. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. An 80 percent rating is assigned for complete paralysis, where the foot dangles and drops, there is no active movement possible of the muscles below the knee, and flexion of the knee is weakened or (very rarely) lost. Id.

Under Diagnostic Code 8526, mild incomplete paralysis is assigned a 10 percent rating. A 20 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is assigned a rating for 20 percent. Severe incomplete paralysis is assigned a rating of 30 percent. Finally, a 40 percent rating is assigned for complete paralysis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8526 (femoral nerve).

The term "incomplete paralysis" with peripheral nerve injuries indicates a degree of loss or impaired function substantially less than the type pictured for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to the varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for mild, or at most, the moderate degree. See Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124(a).

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" are not defined in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence, to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.

Mild is generally defined as "not being or involving what is extreme" or "not severe." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 787 (11th ed. 2003). Moderate is generally defined as "tending toward the mean or average amount." Id. at 798. Severe is generally defined as "of a great degree" or "serious." Id. at 1140.

When the involvement is only sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. In rating peripheral nerve disability, neuritis-characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain, at times excruciating-is to be rated on the scale provided for injury of the nerve involved, with a maximum equal to severe, incomplete paralysis. The maximum rating to be assigned for neuritis not characterized by organic changes referred to in this section will be that for moderate incomplete paralysis, or with sciatic nerve involvement, for moderately severe incomplete paralysis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.123.

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran first reported for a VA examination in February 2021. During this examination, the examiner found no radicular pain or signs and symptoms due to radiculopathy. The Veteran failed to report to a scheduled October 2021 VA examination.

A December 2021 VA examination reflected a diagnosis of radiculopathy. Physical examination reflects the Veteran's reports constant daily back pain with radiation to both legs with numbness and tingling to both lower extremities, more severe on the left. Muscle strength testing was 4/5 for bilateral hip flexion, bilateral great toe extension, bilateral knee extension, bilateral ankle plantar flexion and bilateral ankle dorsiflexion. Muscle atrophy was not found. Reflex examination was found to be normal bilaterally for knee and ankle. Sensory examination found the upper anterior thigh, thigh/knee, to be normal bilaterally while the lower leg/ankle and foot toes to be decreased bilaterally. Straight leg raising test was positive bilaterally. Constant pain and intermittent pain were found to be moderate in the right lower extremity and severe in the left lower extremity. Paresthesias and/or dysesthesias were found to be moderate bilaterally; and numbness were found to be mild bilaterally. The examiner noted that the affected nerves were bilateral sciatic nerves and the left lower extremity femoral nerve. 

Further review of the record shows that the Veteran receives VA treatment for various disabilities. However, there is no indication from the treatment notes of record that the Veteran has reported bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy symptoms that are worse than those noted above.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 20 percent for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve as well as left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve is not warranted. The February 2021 VA examination found the Veteran's lower extremity reflexes to be normal bilaterally and sensation examination to be normal bilaterally. In addition, the December 2021 VA examination found muscle strength testing 4/5 for bilateral hip flexion, bilateral great toe extension, bilateral knee extension, bilateral ankle plantar flexion and bilateral ankle dorsiflexion. Constant pain and intermittent pain were found to be moderate in the right lower extremity and severe in the left lower extremity. Paresthesias and/or dysesthesias were found to be moderate bilaterally; and numbness were found to be mild bilaterally. The Veteran has not alleged, and the record does not establish, diminished or loss of reflexes or muscle atrophy. Accordingly, a rating in excess of 20 percent for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve as well as left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve is not warranted at any time during the appeal period.

In so finding the above, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's contentions that his left and right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve as well as left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve are more severe than contemplated by the current rating assigned. The Veteran is competent to report symptoms such as pain because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). However, he is not considered competent to medically attribute or assess the severity of his lower extremity radiculopathy as required in the Diagnostic Code. See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007). Moreover, to the extent that the Veteran alleges that he is entitled to a higher rating due to pain, interference with standing, balance and ambulation problems, and difficulty walking, and other symptoms reported, the Board notes that such symptoms are contemplated under the current ratings assigned. Therefore, his statements do not constitute competent evidence and, the Board assigns more probative weight to the competent medical evidence of record. To the extent that the Veteran's representative has asserted that the December 2021 examination is not adequate to rate the Veteran's radiculopathy, the Board notes that this examination provided findings related to a loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain and reflected the Veteran's subjective complaints. The December 2021 VA examination is adequate for rating purposes and argument is without merit.

The Board has considered whether a staged rating under Hart v. Mansfield, supra, is appropriate for the Veteran's service-connected left and right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve as well as left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve; however, the Board finds that his symptomatology has been stable throughout the period on appeal. Therefore, assigning a staged rating for such disabilities are not warranted. The Veteran and his attorney have not raised any other issues, and no other issues have been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).

Additionally, the Board has considered whether an inferred claim for a total disability based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) has been raised pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). An April 2024 rating decision awarded entitlement to a TDIU, effective December 7, 2021, as a result of the Veteran's service connected right hand 5th metacarpal fracture, lumbosacral strain, left lower extremity femoral radiculopathy, right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy. The Veteran has not alleged, and the record does not establish, that he is unable to obtain and maintain employment solely due to his left lower extremity femoral radiculopathy, left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and/or right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy. As such, the Board finds that a claim for a TDIU is not raised in connection with the instant appeals. See Rice v. Shinseki, supra.

VA's duty to maximize benefits requires it to assess all of a claimant's service connected disabilities to determine whether any combination of the disabilities establishes eligibility for special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008). In Bradley, the Court held that 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) permits a TDIU rating based on a single disability to satisfy the statutory requirement of a "total" rating. When a veteran is awarded TDIU based on a single disability and receives schedular disability ratings for other conditions, special monthly compensation based on the statutory housebound criteria may be awarded so long as the same disability is not counted twice, i.e., as a basis for TDIU and as a separate disability rated 60 percent or more disabling. See 75 Fed. Reg. 11,229, 11,230; Summary of Precedent Opinions of the VA General Counsel (March 10, 2010) (withdrawing VAOPGCPREC 6-1999 in light of Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 280).

A veteran with a 100 percent schedular rating for a single service-connected disability could also obtain a TDIU on a single separate disability (though not on multiple service-connected disabilities), in order to meet the special monthly compensation requirements (100 percent rating plus 60 percent rating). A TDIU could meet the special monthly compensation requirements by either: a) increasing a single disability rating of less than 60 percent to at least 60 percent (in a case where a separate 100 percent rating is already established), or b) increasing a single disability that is less than 100 percent to a "total" (100 percent) rating, in a case where there is already established a combination of other ratings that meet the separate 60 percent rating requirement for special monthly compensation. See Buie at 249-50. The Veteran has been awarded a TDIU based on the combined effects of his service connected right hand 5th metacarpal fracture, lumbosacral strain, left lower extremity femoral radiculopathy, right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and he does not have service connected disabilities that are separately rated as 60 percent disabling. Therefore, special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) for statutory housebound benefits is not warranted.

Based on foregoing, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity femoral radiculopathy, right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy is not warranted. The appeals are denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.
