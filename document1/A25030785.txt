ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran does not have a verified stressor.

2. The Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was not incurred during service and is not otherwise etiologically related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 4.125.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1976 to June 1979.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  The Board notes that on the VA Form 10182, the Veteran expressed disagreement with the denial of service connection for PTSD in a February 9, 2024, decision.  A review of the record indicates that a rating decision was not issued on February 9, 2024, and the only rating decision issued in the one-year period prior to the Board's receipt of the VA Form 10182 that addressed the issue of service connection for PTSD was issued on January 22, 2024.  Thus, the Board concludes that the Veteran is appealing the denial of service connection for PTSD in the January 22, 2024, rating decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.

The Veteran contends he has PTSD due to witnessing a soldier fall to his death while parachuting.  

Based on the evidence of record, the Board has recharacterized the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, more broadly as a claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection for PTSD requires (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); (2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).  Lay evidence alone may be sufficient to establish the occurrence of an in-service stressor only in certain circumstances, such as when PTSD is diagnosed during service with a stressor related to that service; when a "combat veteran" under 38 U.S.C. § 1154 asserts a stressor related to combat; when the stressor is related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity; or when a prisoner-of-war (POW) under 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(y) asserts a stressor related to POW experience.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(1)-(4).

In the January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability as he was currently being treated for depression.  The AOJ also favorably found that the evidence showed that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service.  However, the Board finds that the AOJ's favorable finding of a qualifying event, injury, or disease during service is a clear and unmistakable error.  The rating decision states, and the record reflects, that the Veteran only provided subjective evidence of a stressor that could not be verified.  As such, the Board is not bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) does not reveal any complaints, treatment, or a diagnosis of PTSD or any psychiatric disorder.  June 1979, January 1985, and January 1989 Reports of Medical Examination documented that the Veteran had a normal psychiatric clinical evaluation, and in January 1985 and January 1989 Reports of Medical History, the Veteran denied experiencing frequent trouble sleeping, depression or excessive worry, or nervous trouble of any sort.

Post-service private treatment records from June 2015, June 2016, March 2017, June 2017, June 2018, August 2018, November 2018, and October 2019 contain psychiatric review of systems findings that were negative for anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances.  December 2014, March 2015, May 2015, June 2016, September 2016, June 2017, March 2018, and March 2019 private treatment records contain psychiatric review of systems findings that document the Veteran had a history of nervousness.

Post-service VA treatment records contain a negative PTSD screening in May 2020 and negative depression screenings in June 2021 and July 2022.  

A February 2023 VA treatment record reflects that the Veteran reported thinking about his son that he lost to murder in 2003 and that he had "flashbacks" about seeing a fellow soldier's parachute not opening.  He reported having intrusive thoughts of losing his son and the soldier who lost his life from jumping from the airplane.  The impression was major depressive disorder, single episode, severe; rule out PTSD - "likely PCL5 suggestive of severe PTSD symptoms;" insomnia likely due to mental disorder and obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and prolonged grief/bereavement.  A February 2023 VA after visit summary provided to the Veteran documented diagnoses of major depressive disorder, single episode, severe without psychotic features; PTSD, chronic; other insomnia; and other chronic pain.

A May 2023 VA treatment record noted he had a history of major depressive disorder, and an August 2023 VA treatment record noted diagnoses of depression and PTSD.

In August 2023, the Veteran filed a claim seeking service connection for PTSD, and in an August 2023 Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for PTSD, the Veteran reported that around 1978 to 1979 while serving at Fort Bragg, he witnessed a soldier's parachute not opening and the soldier fell to his death.  Subsequently, the AOJ sent the Veteran a letter advising him that the information received did not meet the minimum level of detail needed for VA to seek assistance from the U.S. Army and Joint Service Records Research Center (JSRRC) to verify the claimed stressful event.  The AOJ requested the Veteran provide an approximate 90-day date range of the accident and the name of the soldier involved in the parachute accident.  The Veteran was advised that failure to respond or failure to provide a complete response to the request may result in a denial of the claim.

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a second Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for PTSD, on which he reported the incident occurred in 1977 at Fort Bragg.  He stated that while going through basic training of combat jumps, the Veteran and a fellow soldier had just completed their jump when they looked up and observed a fellow trooper coming down with his parachute "in a cigarette roll position."  The Veteran stated that he "did not use his reserve and fell to his death."  He reported that he did not know who the soldier was and that he was with another unit on a training exercise.  He stated that they did not hear anything of the incident after this, and he said that the soldier that was with him that day was A.M., who he had not seen or heard from since departing from the military.

In a June 2024 Appellate Brief, the Veteran's representative requested the Board remand the claim to afford the Veteran a VA examination.

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is not warranted.  The evidence does not support finding that his acquired psychiatric disorder was incurred during service or is otherwise etiologically related to his active service.

First, his STRs are silent for complaints, treatment, or a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder.  Reports of Medical Examinations in June 1979, January 1985, and January 1989 documented a normal psychiatric clinical evaluation, and in January 1985 and January 1989 Reports of Medical History, the Veteran denied experiencing frequent trouble sleeping, depression or excessive worry, or nervous trouble of any sort.  Post-service treatment records do not document an acquired psychiatric disorder for many decades following separation from service.  The record reflects a diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder in February 2023, over 40 years after his separation from service.  See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the passage of many years between discharge from active service and the medical documentation of a claimed disability is one factor to consider as evidence against a claim of service connection).  

The Board recognizes that the Veteran was not provided with a VA examination with respect to his claim and acknowledges the representative's request for the Board to remand the claim to afford the Veteran a VA examination.  Under McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), in initial service connection claims, VA must provide a VA medical examination where there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service; (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service; and (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for VA to make a decision on the claim.

In this case, the Board finds that the AOJ did not commit a pre-decisional duty to assist error in not affording the Veteran a VA examination with respect to his claim, as the Veteran provided insufficient evidence that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service.  Accordingly, the Board finds that no further development of the Veteran's claim is required.

As noted above, the Veteran contends that his psychiatric disorder is related to witnessing the death of another soldier during a parachute accident.  In an August 2023 letter, the AOJ requested the Veteran provide more specific details regarding the parachute accident including an approximate 90-day date range of the accident and the name of the soldier involved in the accident.  However, the Veteran did not provide the AOJ with this information.  Additionally, the Veteran provided inconsistent information regarding the parachute accident.  For instance, he initially reported in the August 2023 statement that the accident occurred in 1978 to 1979, but in his September 2023 statement, he reported the accident occurred in 1977.  Such inconsistencies weigh against his overall credibility.  Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 510-11 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (in weighing credibility, VA may consider interest, bias, inconsistent statements, bad character, internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, self-interest, consistency with other evidence of record, malingering, desire for monetary gain, and demeanor of the witness).

As to PTSD specifically, his claimed stressor has not been verified, and he did not provide sufficient information for the AOJ to attempt to corroborate his stressor.  He also does not qualify for any of the regulatory exceptions to the requirement for corroborating evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(1)-(4).  Specifically, the Veteran does not assert, and there is no evidence otherwise showing, he was diagnosed in service with PTSD, a combat veteran asserting a stressor related to that combat, a stressor related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, or a POW.  Although the record includes a diagnosis of PTSD, a diagnosis alone does not constitute sufficient evidence to grant service connection.  As no verified stressor has been shown, service connection for PTSD is not warranted.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran has participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) due to exposure to a gas chamber while acting as a drill sergeant training other soldiers.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1119.  Although VA has an obligation to obtain medical opinions for any service connection claim which cannot be granted where there is evidence of a TERA and of a disability, VA has identified several exceptions to this general obligation where there is no indication of an association between the disability and the TERA.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(b).  Specifically, a TERA opinion is not required for disabilities resulting from physical trauma; mental disorders; disabilities that have not been shown to have any positive association with herbicide exposure; and disabilities that manifested during service or with a clear etiology that is not associated with toxic exposure.  See VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).  In this case, as the Veteran is claiming service connection for a mental disorder, an exception to the TERA opinion requirements applies, and thus, there was no pre-decisional duty to assist error on the part of the AOJ in not affording the Veteran a VA examination and obtaining a TERA medical opinion.  As such, remand for an examination and opinion is also not warranted on this basis. 

For the reasons and bases stated above, the Board finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is not warranted.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not nearly in balance, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Accordingly, the claim is denied.
