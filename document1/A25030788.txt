ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 11, 2021 for the award of additional dependency benefits for the Veteran's child, A., is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Regional office (RO) did not receive the appellant's completed VA Form 21-686c form to add A. as a dependent until March 11, 2021.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to March 11, 2021 for the award of additional dependency benefits for the Veteran's child A. have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1115, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.4, 3.31, 3.204, 3.400, 3.401.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1980 to May 1987.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2021 decision letter of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).   

In the May 12, 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 11, 2021 for the award of additional dependency benefits for the Veteran's child A.

A Veteran who is in receipt of disability compensation of 30 percent or more is entitled to an additional allowance for each dependent.  38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4(b)(2).

A "child" of the Veteran for VA benefits purposes is defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.57.  A child must be "unmarried" and must be either (i) under the age of 18; (ii) have become permanently incapable of self-support before the age of 18; or (iii) be between the ages of 18 and 23 and pursuing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution.  38 U.S.C. § 101(4)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.57(a)(1).

An award of additional compensation on account of dependents based on the establishment of a disability rating in the percentage evaluation specified by law for the purpose shall be payable from the effective date of such rating; but only if proof of dependents is received within one year from the date of notification of such rating action.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(f); 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b)(3).

Regarding additional compensation for dependents, the effective date will be the latest of the following dates: (1) date of claim; (2) date the dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating, provided evidence of dependency is received within a year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the Veteran's award.  38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).

The "date of claim" for additional compensation for dependents is the date of a veteran's marriage or the date of birth or adoption of a child, if evidence of the marriage, birth, or adoption is received within one year of the event; otherwise, the "date of claim" is the date that notice is received by VA of the dependent's existence, if evidence supporting the existence of the dependent is received within one year of a veteran's notification of VA's request for that evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (f), (n); 38 C.F.R. § 3.401 (b)(1).

However, 38 C.F.R. § 3.31 instructs that regardless of VA regulations concerning effective dates of awards, generally, the payment of monetary benefits based on original, reopened, or increased awards of compensation, pension, dependency and indemnity compensation, or a monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 cannot be made for any period prior to the first day of the calendar month following the month in which the award became effective. 

The appellant has been in receipt of the requisite VA disability compensation benefits to add a dependent since February 20, 1996.  See September 1998 Rating Decision Codesheet.  

In January 2018, the RO received VA 21-686c request form to add S. as a dependent.  It noted her date of birth, social security number, and place of birth.  It also noted she was adopted.  See January 2018 Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents.  The Veteran also submitted court documents showing he and his spouse were appointed the child's legal guardian in January 2018.  See January 2018 Court Documents - General.  

In April 2018, the RO denied the claim based on the child's relationship as a dependent was not established since the child had not been legally adopted.  See January 2018 Notification Letter.  

In December 2018, the Veteran submitted another VA 21-686c form for S. along with an adoption decree dated that same month that also shows her name was legally changed to A.  The dependency form listed the child under the former name and the new name.  See December 2018 Adoption Decree.  

In January 2019, the RO informed the Veteran and appellant that A.'s place of birth on the January 2018 form was different than the place of birth listed on the December 2018 form and that to reconcile the discrepancy, the child's birth certificate was needed.  See January 2019 Subsequent Development Letter. 

In March 2019, the RO also informed the Veteran and appellant that there were two different social security numbers provided for A and that to reconcile the inconsistency, the child's social security card was needed.  See March 2019 Subsequent Development Letter.  

A May 2019 letter notified the Veteran and appellant that the claim was denied because the requested evidence to reconcile the inconsistencies was not submitted.  See May 2019 Notification Letter.

In October 2020, the RO received A.'s birth certificate.  See October 2020 Birth Certificate.  

In March 2021, the RO received a completed VA 21-686c for A.  See March 2021 Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependent.  

In March 2021, the RO granted the application and added A. as a dependent child, effective March 11, 2021, as this was the date they received the required information.  See March 2021 Notification Letter.  

In May 2021, the appellant stated, due to Covid, there was a delay in getting A.'s birth certificate.  Because there had been a backlog, it had taken over a year to get the birth certificate.  The appellant requested back pay to when A. was first adopted.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

Because the RO did not receive the necessary information until March 2021, the Board is unable to assign an earlier effective date.  When the Veteran submitted the December 2018 application to add A. along with the adoption decree, the RO explained that there were inconsistencies that required the submission of additional records.  While the appellant provided a reasonable explanation for why there was a delay in providing A.'s birth certificate earlier, he only had one year to submit the requested information to protect the December 2018 effective date.  As the information was not received within the prescribed time period, the December 2018 effective date could not be established.  As shown, not all the necessary information and records were in the file until the appellant filed the new application in March 2021. 

Given the above, there is no legal basis to assign an effective date prior to March 11, 2021.  The Board is sympathetic to the appellant's claim; however, the Board is bound by the laws and regulations that apply to claims.  38 U.S.C. § 7104 (c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.5, 20.101(a); see also Taylor v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 147 (2019).
