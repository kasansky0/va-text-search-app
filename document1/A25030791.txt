FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is presumed exposed to herbicide agents due to service in Vietnam during the presumptive period and is diagnosed with hypertension.

2. In December 2024, prior to issuance of a Board decision in the appeal, the Veteran withdrew the claim of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1120, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, 3.317.

2. The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea by the appellant or authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1969 to June 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2021 rating decision issued by Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).   On September 22, 2021, the Veteran filed a timely appeal of that decision using VA Form 10182, Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected to have a Board hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 19.2.  

A Board hearing was scheduled for December 2024.  However, on September 5, 2024, the Board received notice from the Veteran's attorney stating that the Veteran wanted to withdraw the hearing request for the issues of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea and hypertension.  38 C.F.R.§ 20.704(e). 

Because of the Veteran's selection of review through the Board's hearing docket and subsequent withdrawal of that hearing request, the Board may only consider evidence submitted at the time of the rating decision on appeal and evidence submitted within 90 days following receipt of the September 5, 2024, withdrawal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.302(b).   

Remand is permitted only to cure pre-decisional errors in VA's duty to assist the Veteran in substantiating the claim; and to correct errors in VA's duty to satisfy a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability caused by disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  In order to establish service connection for a claimed disability, there must be (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence, generally medical, of a causal relationship between the claimed in service disease or injury and the current disability.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247 (1999).

For purposes of establishing service connection for a disability resulting from exposure to herbicide agents, a veteran who had active service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam Era, beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, will be presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents during that service, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to herbicide agents during that service.  38 U.S.C. § 1116(f); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a), 3.309(e).  A disease associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents, listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e), will be considered to have been incurred in service under the circumstances outlined in that section even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a).  

On August 10, 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) became law.  In part, the PACT Act added hypertension to the list of diseases presumed to be associated with exposure to herbicide agents.  PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022).

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension

The service personnel records show service in Vietnam from June 1970 to June 1971.  Therefore, the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents during that service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307.  Medical records show that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension in or around 2003.

If a veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during active service, certain diseases shall be service-connected if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6) are met even though there is no record of the disease during service, provided further that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d) are also satisfied.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309.  Hypertension was included in the list of diseases presumptively related to exposure to herbicide agents as of the passage of the PACT Act.  Pub. L. Number 117-168 (2022).

As the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents and has been diagnosed with hypertension, the criteria for service connection for hypertension pursuant to the PACT Act are met and service connection for hypertension is granted pursuant to the PACT Act.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

2. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea

The Board may dismiss any appeal which does not allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the veteran or the authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In December 2024, the Veteran, through his attorney, submitted a request to withdraw the appeal of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  That withdrawal was effective when received.  

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran has withdrawn the appeal and there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration regarding entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, under a basis other than the PACT Act, is remanded.

The Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for hypertension was pending prior to the enactment of the PACT Act.  Therefore, in order to fully consider the claim, a medical opinion which considers whether there is a basis for establishing service connection for hypertension based on direct causation, or on any basis other than as pursuant to the PACT Act is necessary.  Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

A March 2021 VA examiner opined that hypertension was less likely than not the result of a service-connected psychiatric disability.  The examiner explained that the Veteran's hypertension was the result of genetics, smoking, and the Veteran's history of hyperlipidemia, renal disease, and cardiomyopathy.  

The Board finds the March 2021 VA examination report incomplete because the VA examiner did not address whether service or any service-connected disability aggravated the Veteran's hypertension.  Although the examiner attributed hypertension to the Veteran's genetics, smoking, and other morbidities, the examiner did not explain why those etiologies were a more likely cause of the Veteran's hypertension.  When VA provides an examination or obtains an opinion, the examination or opinion must be adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).

Providing an incomplete or inadequate VA examination is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  The AOJ did not obtain a complete or adequate etiology opinion.  Therefore, remand for a VA examination is necessary to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the etiology of hypertension.  The examiner must review the claims file, to include a copy of this Remand, and consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding symptoms during and since service.  A clearly stated rationale with references to the record, and medical literature should be provided for each opinion.  The examiner should:

(a.) Opine whether it is as likely as not that hypertension had its onset in or is otherwise related to service or any incident of service.  The examiner is advised that an opinion based on the lack of medical evidence without considering the Veteran's lay reports is inadequate.  The examiner should discuss: (1) the August 2003 VA medical record showing diagnoses of renal failure due to steroid therapy from cryptococcal pneumonia, cholecystectomy, chronic pneumonia, cardiomyopathy, and hypertension; and (2) the March 2021 VA examination report.  If the disability is attributed to another etiology, the examiner should explain why the other etiology is more likely.    

(b.) Opine whether it is as likely as not that hypertension manifested to a compensable degree within one year following separation from service.

(c.) Opine whether it is as likely as not that hypertension, is due to, the result of, or caused by the service-connected disabilities or treatment for the service-connected disabilities, to specifically include a psychiatric disability.  

(d.) Opine whether it is as likely as not that hypertension, has been aggravated (increased in severity) by the service-connected disabilities or treatment for the service-connected disabilities, to specifically include a psychiatric disability.  Aggravation need not be permanent.  Aggravation can be found where the service-connected disability prevents treatment of, or lessens the efficacy of treatment of, the nonservice-connected disability, resulting in increase in the nonservice-connected disability.
