ORDER

The appeal involving service connection for fatty liver (hepatic steatosis) and neurological problems (also claimed as neurobehavioral effects) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a January 21, 2025, correspondence, the Veteran, through his representative, requested withdrawal of the above claims on appeal. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for fatty liver (hepatic steatosis) have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for neurological problems (also claimed as neurobehavioral effects) have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the U.S. Marine Corps from March 1986 to September 1992.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In his July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

1. Entitlement to service connection for fatty liver (hepatic steatosis, also claimed as liver malfunctions)

2. Entitlement to service connection for neurological problems (also claimed as neurobehavioral effects)

The Veteran's appeal stems from a January 2023 Supplemental Claim requesting service connection for hepatic steatosis and neurobehavioral effects including anxiety, sleeplessness and anger. A February 2024 rating decision denied service connection for fatty liver and neurological problems (also claimed as neurobehavioral effects).

On January 21, 2025, the Veteran's representative notified the Board that the Veteran wished to withdraw his appeals. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. Id.

In the present case, the Veteran's representative submitted a "Motion to Withdraw Appeal" with Docket Number 240627-452724 listed on January 21, 2025. The Veteran's representative indicated the Veteran "moves" the Board to withdraw his appeal. See January 2025 Correspondence, Motion to Withdraw Appeal. Given this request to withdraw the Veteran's appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.
