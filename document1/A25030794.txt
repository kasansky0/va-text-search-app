ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is proximately due to his service-connected generalized anxiety disorder and lumbosacral strain.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 1982 to January 1992; and from February 2002 to August 2003.

This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an August 2023 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). Given the date of the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran's appeal is governed by the modernized review system (known by the Board as AMA). 38 C.F.R. § 19.2. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea

The Veteran asserts he is entitled to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to his service-connected generalized anxiety disorder and lumbosacral strain.

Generally, to establish service connection there must be competent evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the in-service injury incurred or aggravated during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for a disability which is aggravated by, proximately due to, or the result of a service-connected disease or injury under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995). In order to prevail on the issue of entitlement to secondary service connection, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

A January 2017 VA General Counsel opinion concluded that indirect secondary service connection can be granted with obesity acting as an "intermediate step." VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. Specifically, a grant is warranted (1) if the service-connected disability caused the veteran to become obese, (2) if obesity was a substantial factor in causing a subsequent disability, and (3) if this subsequent disability would not have occurred but for obesity. Id.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

In the August 2023 rating decision, the AOJ made favorable findings of a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea and service connection for generalized anxiety (the primary disability). Despite these findings, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim because there was no medical nexus linking his obstructive sleep apnea to his service-connected generalized anxiety. Nevertheless, the Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings under the AMA.

The Veteran submitted a private medical opinion in support of his claim in May 2023. Here, the private physician found that the Veteran's obesity is at least as likely as not due to his generalized anxiety disorder and lumbar spine condition; and that this obesity led to, caused, and/or aggravated his obstructive sleep apnea. The physician explained that the Veteran's service-connected conditions can lead to pain, painful motion, sleep disturbances, diminished motivation, and overeating for comfort which promotes weight gain and obesity. Further, the physician noted that medical literature has documented that obesity is known to predispose patients to, and directly cause, obstructive sleep apnea. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in May 2023. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was less likely than not related to his military service because there was no evidence of complaints or a diagnosis of sleep apnea during his active duty service. The VA examiner did not address whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was proximately due to, or aggravated beyond its normal progression by, his service-connected generalized anxiety disorder or lumbosacral strain.

Another VA medical opinion was obtained in July 2023. Here, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was less likely than not proximately due to his service-connected generalized anxiety disorder. The examiner explained what while this condition can lead to poor sleep, it cannot obstruct the upper airway. The examiner did not address whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is aggravated beyond its normal progression by his service-connected generalized anxiety disorder; and did not address whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is proximately due to, or aggravated beyond its normal progression by, his service-connected lumbosacral strain.

Upon reviewing the pertinent evidence of record, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, as secondary to service-connected generalized anxiety and lumbosacral strain, is warranted. In this regard, the competent medical evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran's service-connected generalized anxiety disorder and lumbosacral strain caused the Veteran to become obese and subsequently develop obstructive sleep apnea. 

Here, the May 2023 and July 2023 VA medical opinions are inadequate. The May 2023 VA medical opinion did not address whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was proximately due to, or aggravated beyond its normal progression by, his service-connected generalized anxiety disorder or lumbosacral strain. The July 2023 VA examiner did not address the Veteran's contentions that his service-connected conditions caused him to gain weight, and did not address whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was proximately due to his service-connected lumbosacral strain; or aggravated beyond its normal progression by his service-connected generalized anxiety disorder or lumbosacral strain. Thus, these medical opinions are inadequate and are afforded little probative weight. 

In contrast, the Board finds that the May 2023 private physician's medical opinion is entitled to great probative weight as it considered all the pertinent evidence of record, to include the statements of the Veteran, and provided a complete rationale, relying on and citing to the records reviewed. Moreover, the private physician offered clear conclusions with supporting data as well as reasoned medical explanations connecting the two. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A]medical opinion... must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions"). 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence of record is in favor of the Veteran's claim, and entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is warranted.
