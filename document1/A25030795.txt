CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of May 13, 2011, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(c).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service with the U.S. Marine Corps from November 1985 to December 1991.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 higher level review (HLR) decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). The HLR decision was based on the record at the time of an October 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601.

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement (Form 10182) and elected the Direct Review docket. Under direct review, no development may be undertaken; the Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) considers the same record as the AOJ in rendering a decision, in this case that set by the October 2023 decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601, 20.301.

Earlier Effective Date

The determination of the effective date of an award is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), which states that, "[u]nless specifically provided otherwise..., the effective date of an award based on an original claim, [or] a claim reopened after final adjudication... shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor."

By way of history, the Veteran filed an original claim for service connection for PTSD on May 13, 2011. In a February 2012 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for PTSD. Under evidence the AOJ noted that excerpts of his military personnel file were reviewed. The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement (NOD) disagreeing with the February 2012 rating decision or otherwise seek appellate review of the decision. However, on August 29, 2013, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ seeking service connection for PTSD. In a June 2014 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for PTSD. Under evidence the AOJ did not list that the Veteran's military personnel records were reviewed. The Veteran did not file a NOD disagreeing with the June 2014 rating decision. 

On March 8, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA 20-0995 seeking service connection for PTSD. In July 2023, military personnel records were associated with the Veteran's file. In an October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD with an effective date of March 8, 2023. Under evidence the AOJ noted that the Veteran's personnel records from November 8, 1985, to December 16, 1991, were reviewed. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), if, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim. By directing a reconsideration of the previously denied service connection claim, rather than a reopening, it places the Veteran in the position he would have been had the VA considered the relevant service department record before the disposition of his earlier claim. See Blubaugh v. McDonald, 773 F.3d 1310, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

In analyzing the record, and in the interest of viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds that the appropriate date for the Veteran's award of service connection for PTSD is May 13, 2011, the receipt date of the Veteran's initial claim of service connection. In the February 2012 rating decision, the AOJ noted that only "excerpts" of his military personnel file were reviewed. In the June 2014 rating decision, the AOJ did not indicate review any military personnel records. 

In July 2023, complete military personnel records were associated with the file. In the October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD. The AOJ noted the Veteran's completed military personnel records were reviewed.  The Board notes that it cannot know which military personnel records were reviewed during the February 2012 rating decision. Resolving in favor of the Veteran, because military personnel records had not been previously considered, the prior May 2011 claim should be reconsidered under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). Service connection has been granted, and the question at issue is selection of the proper effective date. No prior unadjudicated claims were outstanding. Therefore, the Board finds that the appropriate date for the Veteran's award of service connection for PTSD is May 13, 2011.
