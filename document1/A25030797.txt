ORDER

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a sinus disorder is dismissed.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In an unappealed December 2019 rating decision, the issues of entitlement to service connection for a sinus disorder and sleep apnea were denied. The determination is final.

2. In July 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) did not render a decision addressing the issues of entitlement to service connection for a sinus disorder and/or sleep apnea.

3. The August 2023, VA Form 10182, Appeal to the Board, is untimely for the December 2019 determination and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for a sinus disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.151, 3.2400, 19.2, 20.205, 20.1103.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.151, 3.2400, 19.2, 20.205, 20.1103.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2005 to November 2005, December 2008 to November 2009, and June 2013 to March 2014. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from receipt of an August 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), in which the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Notably, the Veteran indicated his appeal pertained to a rating decision issued in July 2023, however, no July 2023 rating decision was issued. The only rating decision which addressed the issue of entitlement to service connection for a sinus disorder and/or sleep apnea was issued in December 2019.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a sinus disorder.

2. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.

The Board finds that the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for a sinus disorder and sleep apnea must be dismissed.

As noted above, the Veteran's claims for service connection for a sinus disorder and sleep apnea were denied in December 2019. The Veteran did not appeal that decision. Thus, it became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103. It is also noted that the determination does not meet any criteria for review within the Veterans Appeals Implementation and Modernization Act (AMA). See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2.

Thereafter, the record shows that in July 2023 the Veteran submitted, in relevant part, VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, indicating he sought service connection for a sinus condition and sleep apnea. In a July 2023 correspondence, the Veteran was informed that as his claim for service connection for a sinus condition had previously been denied, he must file his claim on the proper form, a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. The record does not indicate the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 for his claimed disorders prior to the filing of the August 2023 NOD. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (a claim means a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief of entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). Further, as noted above, no rating decision was issued in July 2023. Thereafter, in August 2023 VA received the Veteran's NOD. Notably, after the Veteran's NOD was received by the Board, the Veteran filed an August 2024 supplemental claim which was adjudicated by the AOJ in rating decision issued in January 2024. 

In January 2025, the Board sent the Veteran and his representative a letter indicating the Veteran's NOD was not timely and provided the Veteran 60 days to respond. The letter further indicated if the Veteran or his representative did not respond within 60 days, the immediate appeals would be dismissed. No response from the Veteran or his representative has been received. 

In this case, prior to the filing of the August 2023 NOD, the Veteran did not submit a claim for service connection for a sinus disorder and/or sleep apnea on the proper form. The July 2023 administrative letter is not a decision addressing the service connection claims. Further, the August 2023 NOD is not a timely submission for any decision regarding the matter, nor has good cause asserting such been presented. Accordingly, there is no allegation of error of fact or law for appellate review.
