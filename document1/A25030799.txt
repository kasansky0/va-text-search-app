REMANDED

The claim for service connection for a low back disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1979 to April 1994.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2020 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the August 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

A February 2024 Board decision denied service connection for a low back disability, which the Veteran appealed. In October 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) vacated the Board decision and returned the case to the Board for compliance with a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR).

Service connection for a low back disability is remanded.

The February 2024 Board decision denied service connection for a back disability based on a June 2020 VA medical opinion, which found that the Veteran's current back disability was not related to his active service as the in-service injuries were acute and degenerative joint disease is caused by normal wear and tear Additionally, the examiner stated that as there was an absence of back complaints from 1994 to 2008, a nexus could not be established.

The JMR found that the June 2020 VA medical opinion was inadequate, in that it was based primarily on the absence of corroborating medical records and did not consider the Veteran's report of back pain since his in-service back injury, as conveyed in an April 2020 statement. The JMR directed the Board to obtain a new opinion that does not rely only on a lack of corroborating medical records, and adequately addresses the Veteran's reports of experiencing back pain since service.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a VA medical opinion to assess the etiology of the Veteran's back disability. The examiner should answer the following question:

(a.) Is it as likely as not (approximate balance or nearly equal) that the Veteran's current back disability occurred during or was otherwise caused by his active service, to include the in-service back injuries? Why or why not?

In doing so, examiner should address all evidence of record including the Veteran's lay reports (Correspondence received April7, 2020) and should not render the opinion merely based on the absence of objective evidence of chronicity of care. The examiner should review the JMR dated October 2024 (see 10/16/2024 document entitled "CAVC Decision") to 

understand why the June 2020 VA medical opinion was found to be inadequate.
