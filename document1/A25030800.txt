Entitlement to TDIU for service-connected major depressive disorder, from August 1, 2020, is granted.

Special monthly compensation (SMC) under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1114(s), is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to TDIU on an extraschedular basis prior to May 7, 2018, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence of record is at least approximately balanced (or nearly equal) to show that the Veteran service-connected major depressive disorder precluded substantially gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience from May 7, 2018, to June 30, 2019.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding the Veteran's employment from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, was marginal. 

3. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence of record is at least approximately balanced (or nearly equal) to show that the Veteran service-connected major depressive disorder precludes substantially gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience from August 1, 2020.

4. As a result of this decision, the Veteran is in receipt of a TDIU-for two different time periods-based on his service-connected major depressive disorder alone, as well as additional service-connected disabilities rated as at least 60 percent disabling.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to TDIU, from May 7, 2018, to June 30, 2019, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

2. The criteria for entitlement to TDIU from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.16, 4.18, 4.19.

3. The criteria for entitlement to TDIU, from August 1, 2020, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

4. The criteria for SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) are met.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i)a.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably on active duty with the United States Army from July 2005 to June 2008.  

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2019 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the August 2019 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

In the October 27, 2020, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2019 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative, with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Procedural History

In the November 2024 Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) the United States Court of Appeal for Veterans' Claims (CAVC) remanded, in part, the April 2024 Board decision.  In the November 2024 JMPR the parties agreed, the April 2024 Board decision failed to address whether the Veteran's employment prior to October 25, 2020, was only marginal.  The parties agreed the April 2024 Board decision grant of TDIU from October 25, 2020, is a favorable finding that may not be disturbed.

Therefore, the matter remaining before the Board is whether the Veteran's employment prior to October 25, 2020, was only marginal, and if so from when, entitling the Veteran to TDIU prior to October 25, 2020.

Entitlement to TDIU

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Id. 

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018) (combining disabilities as "one disability" to meet the rating threshold of § 4.16(a) requires the use of the combined rating table).

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person.  Id.  The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment.  Id.  Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity).  Id.

Employment in a "protected environment" within 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) is defined as unambiguously "lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market."  LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024).

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training.  See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014).  It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability.  Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  The ultimate question is whether they are capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The Veteran had the following disabilities that were service-connected on the date of the November 2019 rating decision: major depressive disorder rated 50 percent from May 2018, degenerative arthritis of the spine rated 20 percent from June 2017, cervical strain rated 10 percent from June 2008, Gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) rated 10 percent from June 2008, tinnitus rated 10 percent from March 2017, left lower extremity radiculopathy rated 10 percent from April 2019, bilateral pes planus at a non-compensable rating from June 2008, and pseudofolliculitis barbae at a non-compensable rating from June 2008.  The Veteran's combined evaluation for compensation in November 2019 was 70 percent, effective from May 7, 2018. 

Based on the forgoing, on the date of the November 2019 rating decision, the Veteran had at least one disability rated at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Accordingly, the Board may consider the claim for a TDIU on a schedular basis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Entitlement to TDIU is a legal determination, not a medical one.  See Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Medical examiners may provide evidence regarding functional and occupational impairment, but the Board must decide whether a veteran may "secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" based on all evidence of record.  See Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232, 243 (2019). 

1. Entitlement to TDIU due to service-connected major depressive disorder, from May 7, 2018, to June 30, 2019, is granted.

The Veteran submitted the March 2019 fully developed claim for an increased rating of service-connected major depressive disorder.  The Veteran raised TDIU as part of the claim for increased rating.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) (holding that a request for TDIU, whether expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record, is not a separate "claim" for benefits, but rather, is part of a claim for increased compensation).

The July 2019 rating decision granted the Veteran an increased rating for major depressive disorder, to 50 percent disabling, effective May 7, 2018.  The July 2019 rating decision found the May 7, 2018, VA treatment record provides the earliest ascertainable increase in the Veteran's major depressive disorder.  As a result, May 7, 2018, is the earliest date at which the Board may consider the claim for a TDIU on a schedular basis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  The Veteran had at least one disability rated at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  

Factual background

The August 2018 VA treatment record notes that the Veteran works for Toyo Tire factory as an inspector, but the Veteran had not been able to do his job since February 26, 2018.  The August 2018 VA treatment record noted the Veteran had returned to mental health treatment after a tire blew up at work in May 2018.  The Veteran is recorded as stating he worked for a call center from home in 2010 but had difficulty because of anxiety and panic attacks.

The September 2018 VA treatment record notes the Veteran forgets to take his medication and that he remained out of work.

The November 2018 VA treatment record states the Veteran lost his job in October as his employer would not accept his doctor note for being absent.  The Veteran stated the doctors could not find a reason he became lightheaded at work.  The Veteran reported working for post mates when possible and Amazon flex but that he was let go and that his mood has been down.

The March 2019 application for increased compensation based on unemployability set out that the Veteran experienced a triggering event at work in May 2018 while working in tire manufacturing.  The Veteran stated that there was a loud explosion, and it triggered an emotional reaction due to his experience of explosions while deployed in Iraq.  The Veteran sought help in the VA emergency room in Atlanta as a result.  The Veteran stated that he was unable to work as his employer would not agree to accommodations.  The Veteran included a copy of the May 2018 Toyo Tire North America Manufacturing Inc. incident investigation report.  The Veteran's shift manager noted the Veteran was in a disoriented state having heard a loud noise and that it was determined necessary to send the Veteran home for the day.  The Veteran gave his earnings for 2018 as $9000.  The Veteran gave his last date of employment with Toyo tires as October 18, 2018.

The March 2019 Request for employment information confirmed the Veteran last worked for Toyo Tire North America on June 14, 2018, although the Veteran was employed till October 18, 2018.  The Veteran's gross pay for 12 months before leaving employment was $11,183.30.

The March 2019 VA treatment record noted that the Veteran was struggling to find suitable employment and that he was delivering flowers.  The Veteran reported that he worked a couple of jobs through a temp agency, but he quit his first job after 2 days.  The Veteran reported that working in customer service on a chat brought on his anxiety.

The April 2019 VA treatment record noted that the Veteran does some contract work delivering flowers and working part time with his uncle catering.  

The April 2019 VA medical exam (Lumbar spine), the April 2019 VA medical exam (foot conditions), the April 2019 VA medical exam (peripheral nerve conditions), the April 2019 VA medical exam (neck conditions) all noted that the Veteran was able to undertake sedentary work but that he would have difficulty with walking or lifting over 30lbs. 

The June 2019 VA treatment record noted the Veteran was working overnight delivering newspapers as the post mates was not guaranteed work.  The Veteran stated that he likes to work by himself as being around people raises his anxieties. 

The July 2019 VA medical exam (mental disorders) noted the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder.  The July 2019 VA medical exam (mental disorders) found the Veteran to have occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks.  The July 2019 medical exam (mental disorders) found the VA treatment records indicated the Veteran had a history of presenting to the ER with symptoms of anxiety and depression.  The July 2019 VA medical exam (mental disorders) recorded that the Veteran worked for Frito Lay for less than a year and for a couple of months driving a chassis.  The Veteran is recorded as working from February to October 2018 for a tire factory but quit due to "head issues."  From May 2019 the Veteran advised he delivered newspapers but has to go to the emergency room to get shots for back pain.  The Veteran was noted to have depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, flattened affect, and disturbance of motivation and mood.  The July 2019 VA medical exam (mental disorders) recorded the Veteran's report of depressed moods most days, social isolation, and irritability.  The July 2019 VA medical exam (mental disorders) noted that the Veteran stopped taking Prozac as it was ineffective.

The November 2019 Veteran's statement stated that he had not worked at Toyo Tires since June 2018 due to his mental condition, and that in turn led to his termination in October 2018.  The Veteran stated that he had applied to multiple casual jobs including post mates, a flower delivery job, and a newspaper job but that he was no longer working with any or any temp agencies.  The Veteran stated that he continues to experience impulsive bouts of frustration and anger that makes it difficult to interact in employment environments.

The November 2019 VA treatment record states that the Veteran worked for Amazon.

The May 2020 VA treatment record noted that the Veteran was working delivering packages but that he reported that he goes through days with anxiety around his job.  The May 2020 VA treatment record includes a note to excuse the Veteran from work due to severe back pain.  

The October 2020 Veteran's statement provided the Veteran's work history in detail.  The Veteran stated that he worked full time from 2010 to 2014 at Aloricares as a home customer support. The Veteran stated that the office he worked for is now closed and the web site is dead.  The Veteran advised that he lost the position due to anxiety attacks.  The Veteran advised he worked temporarily from June to August 2014 in construction, but his neck went numb.  The Veteran states he worked from 2016 to 2017 for Frito Lay in a part time detailer job but his back experienced spasms.  The Veteran states that from May to August 2017 he worked for Parsec providing train yard work, but his back gave out and medication prohibited his working with heavy machinery.  The Veteran states that he worked for Toyo Tires from February 2018 to October 2018 and as previously detailed he left due to panic attacks.  The Veteran advised that in January 2019 he started working for Inalfa roofing but left after the first day due to anxiety.  In March or April 2019, the Veteran worked in Grubhub customer service but again had an anxiety attack on his first day and left.  The Veteran detailed that he worked as a delivery driver for Marietta Daily Journal from May to July 2019 but left as he got overwhelmed, angry, and depressed.  The Veteran states he worked for Amazon via a courier distribution system from July 2019 to July 2020 but left as he could feel his heartbeat and felt lightheaded.  The Veteran states he went to the ER on two consecutive days, but no physical explanation was identified.  The Veteran advised that he worked for two days in October 2019 for Iron Works but left due to anxiety.  The Veteran states that he last worked from July 2020 to October 2020 for Pristine connections as a delivery driver on contract.  The Veteran states that he had to travel for his job which left him with anxiety and depression, so he had to leave.  The Veteran stated that he was also unable to finish various educational courses from 2014 to 2016, and 2017 to 2018 as he was unable to concentrate due to the feeling of being overwhelmed.

Analysis 

Based on the above the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least evenly balanced to show that - due to the effects of his service-connected major depressive disorder - the Veteran's employment from May 7, 2018, to June 30, 2019, was marginal, and that entitlement to TDIU from May 7, 2018, to June 30, 2019, is warranted.

The April 2024 Board decision found the Veteran competent and credible in his account of his employment history, as well as the reasons he was unable to work.  Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who had knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2).  The April 2024 Board decision afforded the Veteran's November 2019 and October 2020 statements probative weight.

The Board again notes that a finding of TDIU does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability.  Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  The ultimate question is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether the Veteran can find employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).  The Board reiterates the phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person.  Id.   

The Board notes the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person in 2018 was $12,140, in 2019 was $12,490, and in 2020 was $12,760. https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines/prior-hhs-poverty-guidelines-federal-register-references/2020-poverty-guidelines.

The Board finds the evidence of record confirms the Veteran's panic attack while working at Toyo Tires in the May 7, 2018, incident report from Toyo Tires.  

The Board finds the March 2019 Request for employment information confirmed the Veteran last worked for Toyo Tire North America on June 14, 2018, although the Veteran was employed till October 18, 2018.  The Veteran's gross pay for 12 months before leaving employment was $11,183.30.

The Board finds that while there are no other employer confirmations of the Veteran's employment history, there is no reason to doubt the Veteran's November 2019 and October 2020 statements detailing his employment history.  Moreover, as stated above, the Veteran's accounts of his employment are consistent with contemporaneous accounts given in VA treatment records.

In the October 2020 Veteran's statement, the Veteran states he worked for Amazon via a courier distribution system from July 2019 to July 2020 but left as he could feel his heartbeat and felt lightheaded.  The Veteran states he went to the ER on two consecutive days, but no physical explanation was identified.  The Veteran's evidence is that he remained employed for a period of 12 months.  The Veteran has provided no further information as to his income during the 12 months he states he remained employed.

The Board is aware the Veteran provided a February 2021 application for increased compensation based on unemployability.  However, as this is outside of the evidentiary window of the present appeal the Board cannot consider it.  As set out above, if the Veteran would like VA to consider evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  

The Board notes that the duty to assist is a two-way street, and the Veteran has the responsibility to present and support a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).  The Board finds this includes providing sufficient evidence to support finding employment is not more than marginal.

The Board finds, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's employment from May 7, 2018, to June 30, 2019, was only marginal, with income below the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person.  

The Board finds the persuasive weight of evidence supports the Veteran's employment from May 7, 2018, to June 30, 2019, was marginal, due to his service-connected major depressive disorder.

The Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is in favor of finding that the Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder disability precluded him from the ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his education, skills, training, and work history, from May 7, 2018, to June 30, 2019.  At a minimum, the positive evidence in favor of the claim and the negative evidence against the claim are "nearly equal" or "in approximate balance."  

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  Therefore, after resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the evidence supports a grant of TDIU from May 7, 2018, to June 30, 2019.  The Veteran's claim for a TDIU-for this time period-is hereby GRANTED.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

2. Entitlement to TDIU due to service-connected major depressive disorder, from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, is denied.

As set out above, the Board finds the October 2020 Veteran's statement, states the Veteran worked for Amazon via a courier distribution system from July 2019 to July 2020.  The Veteran's evidence is that he remained employed for a period of 12 months.  The Veteran has provided no further information as to his income during the 12 months he states he remained employed.

As the Board has already stated, the duty to assist is a two-way street, and the Veteran has the responsibility to present and support a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).  The Board finds this includes providing sufficient evidence to support finding employment is not more than marginal.

The Board finds the probative evidence does not support finding the Veteran's employment from July 1, 2019, to July 30, 2020, was marginal.  The Board accepts the Veteran's evidence, that he stopped working at the courier distribution system July 2020, due to experiencing a medical event.  However, the Board finds no evidence of record as to the Veteran's income for 12 months from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020.  The Veteran has not provided exact dates of employment in July 2019 or July 2020.  Accordingly, the Board finds it is not reasonable to extend the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, that employment from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, was marginal.  

The Board finds that there is no evidence of record to support finding the Veteran's employment from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, was marginal.  As a result, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, including major depressive disorder, did not render him unable to secure or maintain substantially gainful employment from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  The Board finds TDIU from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  This portion of the Veteran's claim is hereby DENIED.  

3. Entitlement to TDIU due to service-connected major depressive disorder, from August 1, 2020, is granted.

Based on the evidence of record, already set out above, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least evenly balanced to show that - due to the effects of his service-connected major depressive disorder - the Veteran's employment from August 1, 2020, was marginal, and that entitlement to TDIU from August 1, 2020, is warranted.

In the October 2020 Veteran's statement, the Veteran states that he last worked from July 2020 to October 2020 for Pristine connections as a delivery driver on contract.  The Veteran states that he had to travel for his job which left him with anxiety and depression, so he had to leave.  

The Board finds the Veteran's October 2020 statement provides credible evidence the Veteran's employment from July 2020 to October 2020 was limited to less than 3 months.  Although the Veteran has not provided further information on his income, the Board has resolved the benefit of the doubt in the Veteran's favor, that income from contract delivery work, for less than 3 months, does not exceed the U.S. Department of Commerce poverty threshold for one person in 2020.  The Board finds the persuasive weight of evidence supports the Veteran's employment from August 1, 2020, was marginal, due to his service-connected major depressive disorder.

The Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is in favor of finding that the Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder precluded him from the ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, consistent with his education, skills, training, and work history, from August 1, 2020.  At a minimum, the positive evidence in favor of the claim and the negative evidence against the claim are "nearly equal" or "in approximate balance."  

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  Therefore, after resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the evidence supports a grant of TDIU from August 1, 2020.  The Veteran's claim for a TDIU-for this time period-is hereby GRANTED.   See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

4. SMC under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1114(s) is granted. 

As the Board has found that the Veteran is entitled to TDIU based upon his major depressive disorder and has other service-connected disabilities, the Board must also determine whether the Veteran is entitled to SMC.  The Board has jurisdiction to consider entitlement to ancillary benefits such as SMC where entitlement to them is reasonably raised by the claim on appeal.  Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991); 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (2019).

SMC is available when a veteran's service-connected disability causes them to suffer additional hardships above and beyond those contemplated by the schedule for rating disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s).  The regulations provide additional compensation on the basis of being housebound where the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent, and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of their service-connected disability or disabilities.  This permanently housebound requirement is met when the veteran is substantially confined as a direct result of service-connected disabilities to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or, if institutionalized, to the ward or clinical areas and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i).

The Veteran has a TDIU based on a single disability and therefore has "a single disability rated as total" for SMC housebound purposes.  In addition to the Veteran's major depressive disorder the Veteran has the independently rated disabilities of: OSA rated 50 percent, degenerative arthritis of the spine rated 20 percent, cervical strain rated 10 percent, Gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) rated 10 percent, tinnitus rated 10 percent, left lower extremity radiculopathy rated 10 percent, Bell's Palsy rated 10 percent, pseudofolliculitis barbae at a noncompensable rating, restrictive lung disease at a noncompensable rating, and migraines associated with major depressive disorder at a noncompensable rating.  The Board finds that the Veteran has additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability involving different anatomical segments or body systems.  

The Board finds the Veteran meets the criteria for entitlement to SMC(s). 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  Consequently, entitlement to SMC(s) is GRANTED.  The effective date of this award will be assigned by the RO upon implementation of this decision.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to TDIU on an extraschedular basis prior to May 7, 2018, is remanded.

The appeal is remanded so that the AOJ can correct a duty-to-assist error that occurred prior to the November 2019 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) (2020).  The AOJ committed a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error by failing to refer the Veteran's claim of entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis to the Director of Compensation Service. 

VA will grant a TDIU when the evidence shows that the Veteran is precluded, by reason of his service-connected disabilities, from securing or following "substantially gainful employment" consistent with his education and occupational experience.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16; VAOPGCPREC 75-91; 57 Fed. Reg. 2317 (1992).  TDIU can be assigned based on individual unemployability if the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disability, provided that he has one service-connected disability rated at 60 percent or higher; or two or more service-connected disabilities, with one disability rated at 40 percent or higher and the combined rating is 70 percent or higher.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Prior to May 7, 2018, the Veteran was in receipt of an overall disability rating of 70 percent, but no one disability was rated at 40 percent or higher.  Thus, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), the Veteran is not eligible for a schedular TDIU prior to May 7, 2018.  However, as detailed below, extraschedular TDIU referral is warranted.

As noted above, the percentage requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) are not met prior to May 7, 2018; however, a TDIU may still be granted on an extra-schedular basis where a Veteran is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  The Board cannot, in the first instance, award an extraschedular TDIU, but must remand the matter to the VA's Director of Compensation Service for consideration.  Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 10 (2001).

The decision to refer a claim for extraschedular consideration is a factual finding that does not bind the Board when it later decides whether to award an extraschedular rating.  This is because the decisions to refer and to award a rating are fundamentally different.  Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 65 (2019).

Recently, Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1 (2021), held that if the Board denies a referral, it must make two determinations: (1) that a referral for extraschedular TDIU consideration is not warranted because there is insufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a veteran is unemployable because of service-connected disabilities; and (2) that TDIU benefits are not warranted because service-connected disabilities did not render the veteran unemployable.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), remands are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The Board finds there is sufficient pre-decisional evidence to indicate that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities may render him unemployable, or employed in only marginal employment, at least to the extent that referral for extraschedular consideration is warranted. 

The August 2018 VA treatment record notes that the Veteran works for Toyo Tire factory as an inspector, but the Veteran had not been able to do his job since February 26, 2018.  The August 2018 VA treatment record noted the Veteran had returned to mental health treatment after a tire blew up at work in May 2018.

The March 2019 Request for employment information confirmed the Veteran last worked for Toyo Tire North America on June 14, 2018, although the Veteran was employed till October 18, 2018.  The Veteran's gross pay for 12 months before leaving employment was $11,183.30.

This evidence, which was of record at the time of the November 2019 rating decision on appeal, suggests that the Veteran was only in marginal employment from February 26, 2018.  The Board finds the AOJ committed a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error in the November 2019 rating decision.  

The AOJ stated the evidence failed to show the Veteran was unemployable due to service-connected disabilities and did not refer the Veteran's claim of entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis to the Director of Compensation Service.  The Board finds there is evidence of record prior to the November 2019 rating decision the Veteran may have only been in marginal employment due to service-connected disabilities from February 26, 2018.  Accordingly, the Board will remand the matter for referral to the Director of Compensation Service.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Refer the issue of entitlement to an extraschedular TDIU for the period on appeal (prior to May 7, 2018) to the Director of Compensation Service.
