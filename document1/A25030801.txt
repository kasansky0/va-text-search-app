ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 29, 2014 for the grant of service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis is denied.    

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis was granted by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in a March 2022 rating decision, effective May 29, 2014. The claim for pes planus and plantar fasciitis had been previously denied in unappealed and final April 1993, January 2000, November 2004 and May 2013 legacy rating decisions.

2. In a March 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was assigned an effective date for pes planus and plantar fasciitis of May 29, 2014, the date the request to reopen the claim for pes planus and plantar fasciitis was received by VA.

3. There was no formal claim, informal claim, or written intent to file a petition to reopen the claim of entitlement to service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis after the issuance of the final May 2013 rating decision and before the May 2014 request to reopen the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than May 29, 2014 for the grant of service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1991 to December 1992. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the March 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that in August 2022, a Privacy Act request was received from the Veteran for a copy of his claim file. In a September 2024 Report of General Information (VA Form 27-0820), the Veteran stated that he wanted to cancel the request so that his appeal could be decided. In a February 2025 letter, the Board returned the request because the August 2022 Privacy Act request was unsigned. The Veteran did not respond to the letter. As the Board found the Privacy Act request incomplete and given the Veteran's reported withdrawal of the request, the Board shall proceed with adjudication. 

The Board is cognizant of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) holding in Edwards v. McDonough that new evidence submitted with a VA Form 10182 on which the Direct Review option is selected creates uncertainty as to which Board review option the claimant intended, triggering the Board's duty to seek clarification under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f). Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023). The Court reasoned, in-part, that consideration must be given to the "full context within which [veterans'] submissions are made" including liberally construing the filings of pro se claimants. Id. (citing Rivera v. Shinseki, 654 F.3d 1377, 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011)). Here, new evidence, namely an Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance was submitted simultaneously with the March 2022 VA Form 10182. However, the evidence is not relevant to the appeal as the examination pertains to establishing a separate claim for entitlement to special monthly compensation based on the need for aid and attendance. Therefore, the Board shall proceed with adjudication.

The Board notes that in August 2019 correspondence, the Veteran generally reported treatment at several VA facilities. In a September 2019 letter, the AOJ asked the Veteran to provide the dates and places of treatment in order to obtain the necessary records. In September 2019, the Veteran submitted a 38 U.S.C. § 5103 Notice Response that indicated that he had no other information or evidence to give VA to support his claim and that he wanted his claim decided as soon as possible. In a November 2019 letter, the AOJ asked the Veteran to list all medical providers, both Federal and private, their mailing addresses and the dates he was treated. In a November 2019 VA Form 27-0820, the Veteran reported that he had no additional information to provide and waived any remaining response time. The duty to assist is a two-way-street. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991). If the Veteran wished to help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information essential in obtaining the relevant evidence. Id. The Board also notes that in September 2019, November 2019, January 2020, March 2020, August 2020, December 2021 and March 2022 updated VA treatment records were associated with the claim file. Accordingly, the Board proceeds with adjudication of the claim on appeal on the merits.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 29, 2014 for the grant of service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis is denied.   

The Veteran contends that an effective date earlier than May 29, 2014 for the grant of service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis is warranted. See March 2022 Correspondence. Specifically, the Veteran asserts that an effective date of the original service connection claim of December 28, 1992, or in the alternative March 1999, the date of the request to reopen the claim for service connection, is warranted as the AOJ committed clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in evaluating the evidence of record. Id. The Veteran also contends that an effective date of December 28, 1992 is warranted as he filed his original claim for service connection within one year of separation from service. Id.

According to applicable law and regulation, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based upon an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The date of entitlement to an award of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

The effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on a reopened claim is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2), (r). Thus, once a previous decision has become final, the earliest effective date of service connection generally is the date of the petition to reopen rather than the date of the initial claim. Exceptions to this rule include a later grant of service connection based in whole or in part on newly obtained service department records under certain circumstances, as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), and when the decision is revised or reversed on the basis of CUE, as provided in 38 U.S.C. § 5109A(a) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).

A "claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). Any communication indicating an intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). An informal claim must identify the benefits sought; and upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of the receipt of the informal claim. Id. VA regulation explicitly states that "[a]n intent to file a claim must identify the general benefit (e.g., compensation, pension), but need not identify the specific benefit claimed or any medical condition(s) on which the claim is based." See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(2).

The general rule for claims for increased ratings is that the award is effective the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). The effective date of an award of increased compensation is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred, if the claim is received within one year from such date, otherwise, the date of receipt of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). 

An exception to that rule provides that the effective date of an award of an increase shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2), 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

However, if, at any time after the VA issues a decision on a claim, the VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when the VA first decided the claim, the VA will reconsider the claim, notwithstanding the subsection addressing reopening claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3). Service department records that are relevant to the claimed in-service event, injury, or disease, are such                        § 3.156(c) records. However, to qualify as such records, the award of benefits must be based at least in part on the records. Additionally, this does not apply to records that the VA could not have obtained when it decided the claim because the records did not exist when the VA decided the claim, or because the claimant failed to provide sufficient information for the VA to identify and obtain the records.

Significantly, if the claim is granted based on such service department records, the award is to be effective on the date entitlement arose or the date the VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later, or such other date as may be authorized by the provisions of this part applicable to the previously decided claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3).

Although a claimant need not identify the benefit sought "with specificity," see Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 199-200 (1992), some intent on the part of the Veteran to seek benefits must be demonstrated. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998). See also Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995) (noting that while VA must interpret a claimant's submissions broadly, VA is not required to conjure up issues not raised by claimant). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has emphasized VA has a duty to fully and sympathetically develop a veteran's claim to its optimum. Hodge v. West, 155 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1998). This duty requires VA to "determine all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations," Roberson v. West, 251 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and extends to giving a sympathetic reading to all pro se pleadings of record. Szemraj v. Principi, 357 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

A rating decision becomes final and binding if the veteran does not timely perfect an appeal of the decision within one year from the date of the issuance of notice of the decision of the AOJ. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.160(d), 20.200, 20.302, 20.1103. Previous determinations that are final and binding, including decisions of service connection, will be accepted as correct in the absence of collateral attack by showing the decision involved CUE. 38 C.F.R.               § 3.105(a).

The mere presence of medical evidence does not establish intent on the part of the veteran to seek service connection for a disability. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998). The effective date of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but rather, on the date the application was filed with VA. Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999).

The Court held in Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 248 (2002) that, "[t]he statutory framework simply does not allow for the Board to reach back to the date of the original claim as a possible effective date for an award of service-connected benefits that is predicated upon a reopened claim." In order for the veteran to be awarded an effective date based on an earlier claim, he has to show CUE in the prior denial of the claim. Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332, 340 (1995). Moreover, there is no basis for a free-standing earlier effective date claim from matters addressed in a final and binding rating decision. See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

When all the evidence is assembled, the Secretary is then responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

By way of history, the Veteran filed his initial claim of entitlement to service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis on December 28, 1992. The claim for entitlement to service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis was denied in an April 1993 rating decision. In March 1999, the Veteran sought readjudication of the claim. The claim for entitlement to service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis was denied in a January 2000 rating decision. In May 2004, the Veteran sought readjudication of the claim. In a November 2004 rating decision, the claim for entitlement to service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis was denied. In April 2011, the Veteran sought readjudication of the claim. In a May 2013 rating decision, the claim for entitlement to service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis was denied. In May 2014, the Veteran sought readjudication of the claim. In a September 2014 rating decision, the claim for entitlement to service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis was denied. The Veteran timely appealed the decision, and the Board most recently remanded the claim in December 2021. In a March 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis and assigned a 10 percent rating, effective May 29, 2014 and a 50 percent rating, effective January 7, 2020. The Veteran timely appealed the decision to the Board. Those basic facts are not in dispute.  

In April 1993, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for service connection and the Veteran was advised of the decision and his appellate rights in a July 1993 letter. In December 1993 correspondence, the Veteran appealed the decision. In June 1993, physical evaluation board records were received. In June 1994, VA treatment records were received. Neither record addressed the Veteran's pes planus and plantar fasciitis. The AOJ then issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) in July 1994 listing the new evidence and continuing the denial of service connection. The Veteran was advised of the decision in a July 1994 letter. The Veteran did not perfect his appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 19.22, 19.52, 20.302, 20.1103. In this regard, the Board has considered the applicability of 38 C.F.R.             § 3.156(b). However, in the instant case, such regulation is inapplicable as no relevant evidence pertaining to the Veteran's claim for service connection was received or was in the constructive possession of VA prior to the expiration of the appeal period stemming from the April 1993 rating decision. See also Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (2020); Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2011); Roebuck v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 307, 316 (2006); Muehl v. West, 13 Vet. App. 159, 161-62 (1999). In addition, in the July 1994 SOC, VA considered whether the evidence submitted in the year after the notification of the April 1993 rating decision was new and material and considered it in connection with the Veteran's claim. Williams v. Collins, No. 2023-1840 (Fed. Cir. March 19, 2025). Moreover, no additional relevant service records (warranting reconsideration of the claim) have been received at any time. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). The April 1993 rating decision is therefore final.

In January 2000, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for service connection and the Veteran was advised of the decision and his appellate rights in a February 2000 letter. The Veteran did not appeal this decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R.             §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103. In this regard, the Board has considered the applicability of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). However, in the instant case, such regulation is inapplicable as no relevant evidence pertaining to the Veteran's claim for service connection was received or was in the constructive possession of VA prior to the expiration of the appeal period stemming from the January 2000 rating decision. See also Lang v. Wilkie, supra; Bond v. Shinseki, supra; Roebuck v. Nicholson, supra; Muehl v. West, supra. Moreover, no additional relevant service records (warranting reconsideration of the claim) have been received at any time. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). The January 2000 rating decision is therefore final.

In November 2004, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for service connection and the Veteran was advised of the decision and his appellate rights in a November 2004 letter. The Veteran did not appeal this decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103. In this regard, the Board has considered the applicability of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). However, in the instant case, such regulation is inapplicable as no relevant evidence pertaining to the Veteran's claim for service connection was received or was in the constructive possession of VA prior to the expiration of the appeal period stemming from the November 2004 rating decision. See also Lang v. Wilkie, supra; Bond v. Shinseki, supra; Roebuck v. Nicholson, supra; Muehl v. West, supra. Moreover, no additional relevant service records (warranting reconsideration of the claim) have been received at any time. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). The November 2004 rating decision is therefore final.

In May 2013, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for service connection and the Veteran was advised of the decision and his appellate rights in a May 2013 letter. The Veteran did not appeal this decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103. In this regard, the Board has considered the applicability of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). However, in the instant case, such regulation is inapplicable as no relevant evidence pertaining to the Veteran's claim for service connection was received or was in the constructive possession of VA prior to the expiration of the appeal period stemming from the May 2013 rating decision. See also Lang v. Wilkie, supra; Bond v. Shinseki, supra; Roebuck v. Nicholson, supra; Muehl v. West, supra. Moreover, no additional relevant service records (warranting reconsideration of the claim) have been received at any time. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). The May 2013 rating decision is therefore final.

The Board notes the Veteran's contention that he filed his original service connection claim within one year of separation from service. However, as previously discussed, the Veteran's April 1993 rating decision is final. The Board also notes that there is an indication from the record that the Veteran had pes planus and plantar fasciitis before he filed his 1992 claim for entitlement to service connection for such. See March 2022 VA examination. However, the effective date of an award of compensation is the date of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Therefore, the date of receipt of claim is the appropriate effective date as it is later than the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; see Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232 (2007); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28 (2000). 

Given the unappealed, and final, April 1993, January 2000, November 2004 and May 2013 rating decisions, the Veteran can only obtain an earlier effective date prior to May 29, 2014 by establishing that CUE was committed. See Juarez v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 537, 539-40 (2008) ("Of the two options for challenging a final decision, only a request for revision premised on CUE could result in the assignment of an earlier effective date for an award of service connection, because the proper effective date for an award based on a claim to reopen can be no earlier than the date on which that claim was received.") (citing Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d 1333, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("[A]bsent a showing of CUE, [an appellant] cannot receive disability payments for a time frame earlier than the application date of [a] claim to reopen, even with new evidence supporting an earlier disability date."); Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332, 340 (1995) ("[W]hen a claim to reopen is successful and the benefit sought is awarded upon readjudication, the effective date is the date of the claim to reopen."); Bingham v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 470, 475 (2004) ("[I]t is well established that the effective date for an award based on a claim to reopen is generally the date of the claim to reopen."). The Veteran is free to file a motion alleging CUE with the AOJ as to the effective date of May 29, 2014 for entitlement to service connection awarded in the March 2022 decision. Absent such a motion however, the Board cannot find that an effective date prior to the date of the claim to reopen, May 29, 2014, is warranted as the Board lacks jurisdiction to address a matter of CUE in the first instance. Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006).

Accordingly, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than May 29, 2014 for the grant of entitlement to service connection for pes planus and plantar fasciitis is not warranted. The appeal is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
