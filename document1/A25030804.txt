ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus first manifested during active service and he has experienced continuous symptomatology since that time. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(b), 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1980 to July 1984. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in February 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the July 7, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran referenced the February 2024 decision elected the Board's Direct Review docket. Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of February 5, 2024-the date of the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after February 5, 2024, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Service Connection 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. In order to establish entitlement to service connection, there must generally be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) causal connection between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established for a current disability on the basis of a presumption that certain chronic diseases, to include organic diseases of the nervous system, manifesting themselves to a certain degree within a certain time after service must have had their onset in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309(a). For organic diseases of the nervous system, the disease must have manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3). Tinnitus is an organic disease of the nervous system under 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3) and 3.309(a).

If there is no manifestation within one year of service, service connection for a recognized chronic disease can still be established through continuity of symptomatology. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (2013). Continuity of symptomatology requires the chronic disease to have manifested in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). In-service manifestation means a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings. Id. 

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C § 1154(a). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Relatedly, a veteran is competent to report symptoms that he experiences at any time because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007).

In making a determination, the Board must consider all the evidence of record and make appropriate determinations of competence, credibility, and weight. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, all reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran asserts that he began experiencing tinnitus while he was in active service and that his symptoms have continued to the present, having progressively worsened since their original onset. 10/7/2023 VA Form 21-4138, p. 1. As discussed below, because the Veteran has been experiencing tinnitus with continued symptomology since its onset during military service, service connection is warranted. 

The RO's February 5, 2024 rating decision included favorable findings that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus per a January 2024 VA examination and that he experienced an in-service event, injury or disease in relation to his military occupational specialty (MOS) of Land Combat Electronic Missile System Repairer (94A), which had a moderate probability for hazardous noise exposure. 2/5/2024 Rating Decision, p. 4. Because the Board finds no clear and unmistakable error in relation to these favorable findings and otherwise no reason to disturb them, the Board finds that the first two elements of service connection have been established. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

Therefore, the final inquiry involves determining whether there is a medical nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and his active military service. 

The Veteran states that the ringing in his ears started in early 1983 after he was experiencing constant exposure to loud noises from military equipment, including diesel engines, large generators, and cooling units. 10/7/2023 VA Form 21-4138, p. 1. In addition, the Veteran was exposed to live-fire events and rifle ranges. Id. During the summer of 1983, the Veteran attended air assault training, after which time his ringing worsened. Id. Since service, the Veteran's ringing has progressively worsened, with the frequency increasing from approximately once a week to nearly every day of the week. Id.

The Veteran further reported that his ringing has significantly impacted his life, causing distress, physical discomfort, disruption in his sleep, insomnia, depression, and heightened stress. Id. The Veteran attributes his tinnitus with the development of various mental health issues, including anxiety, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. Id. These symptoms have resulted in social withdraw and negative effects on his relationships and work. Id. The Board finds no reason to question the credibility of the Veteran in his description of the manifestation, effects, and history of his symptoms. Therefore, the Board finds that his statements are both competent and credible and that they carry substantial probative weight. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in January 2024. 1/30/2024 C&P Exam. At the examination, the Veteran reported that his symptoms began in approximately 1983, when he was exposed to noise at gun ranges. Id. at 7. The Veteran reported that the sound he hears is a high-pitched, constant ringing sound similar to that of a cicada. Id. The Veteran reported to the examiner that his tinnitus has a negative impact on his ability to focus and to fall asleep. Id. The examiner concluded that because there were no in-service reports of tinnitus and the Veteran had normal entrance and exit examinations, the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not medically related to his active service. Id.

The January 2024 VA opinion does not adequately consider the Veteran's relevant and probative lay statements of record concerning his symptomatology and history. A medical opinion based solely on the absence of documentation in the record is inadequate and a medical opinion is inadequate if it does not take into account the Veteran's reports of symptoms and history (even if recorded in the course of the examination). Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). The January 2024 VA opinion appears to discount the probative value of the Veteran's reported onset of tinnitus in service, as well as his report of continued and worsening symptoms since onset. The report's reliance on the absence of contemporaneous documentation in the record, as well as the lack of consideration given to the Veteran's credible lay statements, renders the opinion inadequate. For these reasons, the Board assigns the January 2024 examination report no probative weight. 

The Veteran's credible lay statements of record establish that his tinnitus onset during service in approximately 1983. The Board finds that this statement, combined with the Veteran's competent and credible reports that he has experienced tinnitus continuously since service, with an increase in frequency from approximately once per week to nearly every day, satisfies the criteria for entitlement to presumptive service connection for tinnitus based on continuity of symptomatology for a chronic disease. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309.

After review of the competent and probative evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is, at a minimum, in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus was caused by his military service. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82. As a result, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is applicable and the Board finds that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.
