REMANDED

The issue of whether the amount of $55,202.93, withheld for fees, is reasonable based on past-due benefits awarded in the May 2024 rating decision is remanded. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's May 2019 appointment of Adam G. Werner (AGW) as his attorney and the associated fee agreement are valid. See Notice of Representation dated May 2019.

2. The attorney's March 2020 withdrawal from representation is valid. See Notice of Withdrawal dated March 2020.

3. In an April 2024 decision, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) issued a decision which granted service connection for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to asbestos exposure.   

4. In a May 2024 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) implemented the Board's April 2024 decision and granted service connection for COPD with an evaluation of 60 percent effective March 30, 2009; an evaluation of 100 percent assigned from March 28, 2018.  In the same decision, the AOJ found special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound criteria being met granted from November 4, 2021; and granted an earlier effective date for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) being established from March 23, 2018.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in the May 2024 rating decision are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant, served on active duty in the United States Navy from December 1963 to May 1965, discharged with under honorable conditions. 

Adam G. Werner (AGW) is the Veteran's former attorney. 

The case is before the Board on appeal from a May 2024 Summary of the Case (fee decision) and constitutes an initial decision on the issue of attorney fees; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Because this is a contested claim, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 fee decision on appeal; a brief or argument filed by the party who did not file the NOD if received within 30 days of the notice of the content of the NOD; and any evidence received within 90 days following the notice that the appeal had been docketed. 38?C.F.R. §§?20.400-20.405.  

If evidence was added to the record during an ineligible period identified above, the Board has not considered that evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The evidence may, however, be considered by the VA Office of General Counsel (OGC) when it adjudicates the issue of the reasonableness of fees. 

The record reflects both the Veteran and AGW were mailed copies of the AMA Initial and Final Notification Letters dated September 2024 and November 2024. 

As for matter of representation, the Veteran has appointed Professor Stacey-Rae Simcox of Stetson University College of Law, Veterans Advocacy Clinic, as his Power of Attorney, effective October 11, 2021.

Issue: Whether AGW is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a May 2024 rating decision. 

Legal Criteria

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904. 

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA.  The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney, and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a).  A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time.  Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1). 

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.  To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined.  Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits.  A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within 30 days of its execution.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).  Fee agreements must be reasonable; those which do not exceed 20 percent of past-due benefits are presumed reasonable.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f).

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1); see also Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28, 32-34 (2023).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case. This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1).

In Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (Federal Circuit) held that agents and attorneys are eligible to receive fees pursuant to supplemental claims filed more than one year after a decision has been under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (b), and thereby invalidating the regulatory provision of 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(c)(1)(i). 7 F.4th 1110, 1135-41 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The Federal Circuit explained that while § 5104C(b) supplemental claims may have a different effective date and duty to notify than § 5104C(a) supplemental claims, see §§ 5110(a)(3), 5103(a)(3), such distinctions should matter in the context of charging attorneys' fees. Id. at 1139.  The Court expressly rejected the government's argument that a § 5104C(b) supplemental claim filed more than a year after a prior decision is not part of the same "case" as that earlier decision, thereby barring attorneys from charging fees for any work on such claims until the supplemental claim itself is rejected. Id. at 1138.

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2). 

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

Analysis

In May 2019, the Veteran executed a VA Form 21-22a on which he appointed Adam G. Werner as his representative.  The parties executed a fee agreement in May 2019 which provided that AGW was entitled to attorney fees in the amount of 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded, and that the fee was to be paid directly by VA to AGW. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's appointment of AGW as his attorney, and the associated fee agreement, are valid. See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g); 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d).  The Board also finds that a valid fee agreement was in place throughout AGW's representation of the Veteran. 

However, the record shows that in March 2020, AGW informed VA that he was withdrawing is representation of the Veteran.  See Notice of Withdrawal dated March 3, 2020.  The Board observes there was no written waiver from the attorney as to collection of fees.  The Veteran appointed Stacey-Rae Simcox as his Power of Attorney, effective October 11, 2021.

By way of history, this matter originates from a July 2009 rating decision under the legacy system, and has a lengthy procedural history outlined below.  By July 2009, June 2010, January 2012, and January 2013 rating decisions, the AOJ denied service connection for COPD associated with asbestos exposure because evidence did not show the claimed condition was related to military service.  

The Veteran, through his representative at the time, initiated an appeal in a legacy Notice of Disagreement (NOD) dated December 2012, before the effective date of the modernized review system.  The Veteran perfected an appeal to the Board where the matter was remanded in August 2016, September 2017, and February 2019.  Notably, AGW was not listed as power of attorney on any of the above decisions.

By August 2020 decision, the Board denied the claim.  The Veteran appealed this decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), which vacated the Board's August 2020 decision.  After another remand in February 2023, the Board ultimately issued a decision in April 2024 granting service connection for COPD based on Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) which confirmed the Veteran's exposure to asbestos with military occupational specialty (MOS) as a firefighter which exposed him to chemicals.  At the time, Stacey-Rae Simcox was listed as the Veteran's power of attorney. 

In a May 2024 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the Board's April 2024 decision.

In a May 2024 Summary of the Case (the fee decision on appeal), the AOJ awarded attorney fees to AGW based on the past-due benefits granted in the May 2024 rating decision.  Specifically, the fee decision explained, "The amount of past-due benefits, which is computed from the effective date of the award through the date of the decision, is $276,014.67. The amount withheld for fees is $55,202.93, which is 20% of past due benefits." 

In a May 2024 statement, the Veteran contested the award of attorney fees of $55,202.93 to AGW, that "this payment to [AGW] is unfair."  The Veteran stated that, "[AGW] did not submit anything to VA regarding my COPD condition. He sent doctor's notes regarding my bladder cancer which has never been service-connected. The only organizations that worked on my COPD condition were DAV and Stetson Law School, both of which provide free services to veterans." See Statement and VA Form 10182 dated June 2024.

As further explained below, the Board finds AGW is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees as a result of past-due benefits awarded in the May 2024 rating decision.  Although the attorney is eligible to the fees, the Board however agrees with the Veteran that the amount is unreasonable.  The Veteran's challenge regarding the reasonableness of such a fee will be discussed further below.

Here, the Veteran first appointed AGW as his representative in May 2019 and the parties entered into a valid fee agreement until March 2020 when AGW informed VA that he was withdrawing his representation of the Veteran.  At the time of withdrawal, the two had a general fee agreement covering all claims before VA, including service connection for COPD.  Because the parties had a general fee agreement, which covered the claims during the pendency of the appeal, AGW represented the Veteran on the issue during a portion or a phase of the appeal.  The benefit granted by the Board in April 2024 and later implemented by the AOJ in May 2024 rating decision was part of the service connection claim, where the AOJ previously issued notice of the initial decision and appeal initiated in a legacy NOD dated December 2012, before the effective date of the modernized review system.  

In May 2019, the Veteran appointed AGW as his representative through valid and established process and the parties had a valid general fee agreement during the pendency of the appeals which covered the issue of service connection for COPD. Therefore, the requirements for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees has been met and, to this extent, the Veteran's appeal is denied. 

Lastly, the Board points out that the Veteran has also raised the issue of the reasonableness of fees awarded to AGW.  Because AGW did not represent the Veteran through the date of the May 2024 rating decision which granted the past-due benefits, 20 percent in past-due benefits is not presumed to be reasonable. See 38?C.F.R. §?14.636(f)(1).  The issue of the reasonableness of the amount of fees awarded must be adjudicated by the VA Office of General Counsel (OGC) in the first instance and is addressed in the remand below.  

Therefore, AGW is not entitled to payment of fees at this time. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The issue of the amount of fees that is reasonable based on past-due benefits awarded in the May 2024 rating decision is remanded. 

Remand of the issue of the reasonableness of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in the May 2024 rating decision is necessary to refer the issue to the VA Office of General Counsel (OGC).  The Board determined that Adam G. Werner is eligible for payment of the fees in the decision above.  

However, the OGC must decide the reasonableness of the amount of the fees in the first instance. See 38?U.S.C. §?5904(c)(3)(A); 38?C.F.R. §?14.636(i); see also Accreditation of Agents and Attorneys; Agent and Attorney Fees, 73 Fed. Reg. 29,852, 29,868-29,869 (May 22, 2008); M21-1, I.3.C.6.c. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Refer the issue of the reasonableness of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in the May 2024 rating decision to the OGC. The Board determined above that Adam G. Werner is eligible for payment of the fees awarded.
