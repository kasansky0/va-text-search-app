ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for hammertoe left foot is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for hammertoe right foot is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his bilateral hearing loss was at least as likely as not attributable to his in-service noise exposure.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his hammertoe left foot began during his active service.

3. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his hammertoe right foot began during his active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hammertoe left foot have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 1112, 1153, 1154, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hammertoe right foot have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 1112, 1153, 1154, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1988 to March 1992.

The Veteran filed an intent to file application in September 2022 and a subsequent claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss, hammertoe left foot, and hammertoe right foot, among other things, in October 2022, with a February 2023 rating decision denying bilateral hearing loss and deferring hammertoe left foot and hammertoe right foot.  A rating decision denying hammertoe left foot and hammertoe right foot was issued in March 2023.  The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 request for higher level review (HLR) of the March 2023 rating decision denying hammertoe left foot and hammertoe right foot.  

In September 2023, the AOJ issued a HLR rating decision denying hammertoe left foot and hammertoe right foot, which, along with the February 2023 bilateral hearing loss denial, are the rating decisions on appeal.  Evidence considered by the AOJ in an HLR decision is limited to the evidence considered in the rating decision for which HLR is requested.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2601(f). Thus, in this case, the evidence considered by the AOJ with respect to hammertoe left foot and hammertoe right foot was limited to evidence received by March 14, 2023.

The AOJ rating decisions on appeal constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 and March 2023 AOJ decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §?20.301.

The Board notes that the Veteran listed bilateral hearing loss as an issue twice in the VA Form 10182; however, such was a harmless error and there are no issues on appeal other than these enumerated herein.  Moreover, to the extent that the Veteran continuously pursued his bilateral hearing loss claim, he filed a Supplemental claim for the same in June 2023, within one year of the February 2023 bilateral hearing loss denial, and the subsequent August 2023 rating decision found there was new and relevant evidence submitted, which constitutes an implicit favorable finding to which the Board is bound.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hz is 40 dB or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hz are 26 or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The absence of in-service evidence of hearing loss is not fatal to a claim for service connection.  Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).  Evidence of a current hearing loss disability (i.e., one meeting the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, as noted above) and a medically sound basis for attributing such disability to service may serve as a basis for a grant of service connection for hearing loss.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993).  Moreover, to establish service connection for sensorineural hearing loss, a veteran is not obligated to show that his hearing loss was present during active service.  However, if there is insufficient evidence to establish that a claimed chronic disability was present during service or during the one-year presumptive period thereafter, the evidence must establish a nexus between his current disability and his in-service exposure to loud noise.  Godfrey v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 352 (1992).

The Veteran is seeking service connection for bilateral hearing loss based on his in-service exposure to hazardous noise as a military police and electronics material specialist.  VA Form 21-526EZ, Receipt Date: October 10, 2022.

Audiometric findings establish bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes from a January 2023 VA examination, and such was conceded in the February 2023 rating decision as an enumerated favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The February 2023 rating decision also conceded noise exposure as a favorable finding.

Therefore, the question before the Board is whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is related to service.  On this question there is evidence in favor of and against the claim.  For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is related to his military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

The evidence against the claim includes a pertinent unfavorable January 2023 VA medical opinion which the Board finds inadequate, in as much as (1) it states that the Veteran did not have any significant shifts in auditory thresholds without addressing the service treatment record (STR) evidence showing threshold shifts, for instance, the audiograms dated April 1, 1988 and September 29, 1989; (2) the rationale relied primarily on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) study without addressing the contradictory language in the report.  See STR, page 28 of 102, Receipt Date: May 2, 2007; McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243 (2019).  After considering the foregoing, the Board assigns minimal probative value to the January 2023 VA medical opinion.  

The evidence in favor of the claims includes the aforesaid STR evidence showing, for instance a shift of +15 decibels for the right ear at 3000 Hertz, as well as the January 2023 VA medical opinion, in so far as the opinion identifies the premise that "the gold standard for determination of auditory damage is positive, permanent shift in auditory thresholds."  The Board acknowledges that the conclusion drawn by the January 2023 VA examiner was unfavorable.  The Board nevertheless relies on the STR evidence to note that the January 2023 VA examiner's conclusion was based on inaccurate facts.  In sum, the Board acknowledges the unfavorable medical evidence of record, noting the deficiencies in the medical rationales as outlined above.  At the same time, the Board acknowledges that the STR evidence contradicts the premise embedded within that very same rationale.  

The Board concludes that the unfavorable medical nexus evidence on the one hand, and the favorable evidence on the other hand, are at least in approximate balance as to the question of whether the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss is etiologically related to his military service.  Given the foregoing, the Board has resolved reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that service connection is warranted for bilateral hearing loss; the claim is thus granted in full.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to service connection for hammertoe left foot.

Entitlement to service connection for hammertoe right foot.

The Veteran was treated during service for bilateral hammertoe.  See STR, page 40 of 102, Receipt Date: May 2, 2007.  Pursuant to a January 2023 VA examination, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of bilateral hammertoe.  Unfortunately, the January 2023 VA examiner erroneously assumed that the Veteran's bilateral hammertoe preexisted service because that was the question which was posed to the VA examiner.  However, as pes planus (not hammertoe) was noted in the Veteran's entrance examination, the VA examiner's rationale is inadequate as it does not address the evidence of an in-service diagnosis and instead provides a rationale for a fact-pattern that is inapplicable to this Veteran.  This is likewise true regarding the March 2023 VA medical opinion, which addresses aggravation of a disability that preexisted service.  

In other words, given that there is no adequate VA medical opinion regarding direct service connection for a disability that did not preexist service, and considering the Veteran's in-service diagnosis and reports during service that he had pain on walking, as well as his current pain and symptoms related to his bent toes, the Board has resolved reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor to find that service connection is warranted for hammertoe left foot and hammertoe right foot; the claims are thus granted in full.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
