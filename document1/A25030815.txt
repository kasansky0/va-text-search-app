FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's OSA was as least as likely as not caused by his service-connected asthma.

2. The Veteran's pulmonary hypertension was as least as likely as not caused by his service-connected OSA.

3. The Veteran's congestive heart failure was as least as likely as not caused by his service-connected pulmonary hypertension.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for OSA as secondary to asthma are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

2. The criteria for service connection for pulmonary hypertension as secondary to OSA are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

3. The criteria for service connection for congestive heart failure as secondary to pulmonary hypertension are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Marine Corps from November 1986 to September 1990. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  The February 2022 rating decision is a higher-level review of a December 2021 rating decision.  

In the October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. Evidence was submitted (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, and the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Within the AMA framework, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) will readjudicate a previously denied claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).  The AOJ acknowledged the need for new and relevant evidence in its December 2021 rating decision in denying the Veteran's claim. However, in a February 2022 Higher-Level Review rating decision, the AOJ did not explicitly state that new and relevant evidence had been presented or secured to warrant readjudication of the claims, but the AOJ proceeded to readjudicate the merits of the other claims. The Board finds that the AOJ implicitly found that readjudication of those claims was also warranted. Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings made by the AOJ. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c)(2021). The Board will therefore proceed to the merits of the Veteran's claims.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c). 38 U.S.C. § 7107 (a)(2).

The Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The evaluation of evidence generally involves a three-step inquiry. First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source. The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007). The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the evidence in light of the entirety of the record.

Neither the Veteran nor his attorney have raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease. In order to prevail on the issue of service connection there must be competent evidence of a current disability; medical evidence, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and competent evidence of a nexus between an in-service injury or disease and the current disability. See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Secondary service connection may also be established for a nonservice-connected disability which is aggravated by a service-connected disability. In such an instance, the Veteran may be compensated for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b); see Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

1. Entitlement to service connection for OSA, to include as secondary to service-connected asthma

The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for OSA. Specifically, he contends that his OSA was caused or aggravated by his service-connected asthma.

The rating decision on appeal states that the Veteran does have a current diagnosis of OSA, as confirmed by a March 2021 VA examination. Accordingly, at issue in the Veteran's claim is whether his current OSA was caused or aggravated by his service-connected asthma.

The Veteran underwent a VA sleep apnea examination in March 2021. The examination included and an-person examination of the Veteran and review of his pertinent medical records. Following the examination, the examiner reasoned that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's OSA was due to or the result of his service-connected asthma. The examiner explained, "[s]leep apnea is not caused by asthma it is caused by oropharyngeal mechanical obstruction." The Board finds that the March 2021 medical opinion is inadequate for purposes of determining secondary service connection because it does not address if the Veteran's OSA was aggravated by his service-connected asthma. Accordingly, no probative value is assigned to the March 2021 medical opinion. 

Conversely, in December 2021, prior to the December 2021 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion addressing the etiology of his OSA. The medical opinion was authored following a video-conference appointment with the Veteran and review of his pertinent medical history. The examiner determined that the "Veteran's diagnosis of [obstructive sleep apnea] was at least as likely as not (50 percent or greater probability) was due to or caused by [service-connected asthma]. The examiner reasoned that medical studies have shown a link between bronchial asthma and OSA, noting that several studies have shown an increased prevalence of sleep disturbance among asthmatic patients, and that "population-based prospective epidemiological study showed that asthma is associated with an increased risk of new-onset OSA. The Board finds the December 2021 medical opinion is thorough and well-reasoned. The December 2021 medical examiner is competent and credible. The Board finds that the December 2021 medical opinion is highly probative evidence in favor of the Veteran's claim for service connection.

Based on the probative medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's current OSA was caused by his service-connected asthma. Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for OSA is warranted.    

2. Entitlement to service connection for pulmonary hypertension, to include as secondary to service-connected OSA

The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for pulmonary hypertension. Specifically, he contends that his pulmonary hypertension was caused or aggravated by his OSA.  The Board granted service connection for OSA in this decision.  

The rating decision on appeal states that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, as confirmed by a March 2021 VA heart conditions examination. Accordingly, at issue in the Veteran's claim is whether his current pulmonary hypertension was caused or aggravated by his service-connected OSA.

In December 2021, prior to the December 2021 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion addressing the etiology of his pulmonary hypertension. The medical opinion was authored following a of the Veteran's pertinent medical history. The examiner determined that the Veteran's diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was at least as likely as not due to or caused by obstructive sleep apnea. The examiner reasoned that OSA is an independent risk factor for pulmonary hypertension, and that pulmonary hypertension tends to improve with treatment of OSA. The examiner noted that pulmonary hypertension is prevalent in patients with OSA. The Board finds the December 2021 medical opinion is thorough and well-reasoned. The December 2021 medical examiner is competent and credible. The Board finds that the December 2021 medical opinion is highly probative evidence in favor of the Veteran's claim for service connection.

Based on the probative medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's current pulmonary hypertension was at least as likely as not caused by his OSA. As a result of this decision, the Veteran's OSA is now a service-connected disability. Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for pulmonary hypertension is warranted.    

3. Entitlement to service connection for congestive heart failure, to include as secondary to service-connected pulmonary hypertension

The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for congestive heart failure. Specifically, he contends that his congestive heart failure was caused or aggravated by his OSA or pulmonary hypertension.  Both OSA and pulmonary hypertension are service-connected as a result of this decision.  

The rating decision on appeal states that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of congestive heart failure, as confirmed by a March 2021 VA heart conditions examination. Accordingly, at issue in the Veteran's claim is whether his current congestive heart failure was caused or aggravated by his OSA or pulmonary hypertension.

The Veteran underwent a VA heart conditions examination in March 2021. The examination included and an-person examination of the Veteran and review of his pertinent medical records. Following the examination, the examiner reasoned that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's congestive heart failure was due to or the result of his service-connected asthma. The examiner reasoned, "Based on the available information from the cardiology consult, [the Veteran's] heart failure in systolic left-sided, and so it is as likely as not secondary to his [hypertension], not asthma." The Board finds the March 2021 medical opinion to be competent, credible, and well-reasoned.

Based on the probative medical evidence of record, including the above-discussed March 2021 VA medical opinion, the Board finds that the Veteran's congestive heart failure was caused by his pulmonary hypertension. The Board notes that as a result of this decision, the Veteran's pulmonary hypertension is now a service-connected disability. Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for congestive heart failure is warranted.
