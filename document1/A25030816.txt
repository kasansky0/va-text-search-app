CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to attorney fees, based on past-due benefits from the November 2022 RO decision granting service connection for a psychiatric disability, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1972 to October 1974.

The appellee is the Veteran's former attorney representative.

This case is on appeal from a November 2022, fee decision which granted eligibility to attorney fees.

In January 2023, the Veteran's current attorney representative timely filed VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement (NOD) to the November 2022 fee decision and elected the Direct Review docket.

A copy of the Veteran's VA Form 10182 pursuant to contested claims procedures was provided to the appellee on January 22, 2025. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.403-4. AMA notification letters were provided to both parties on January 22, 2025, and March 12, 2025. The appellee did not submit a response Therefore, the claim remains on the Direct Review docket, and the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.405. 

Eligibility to attorney fees based on a November 15, 2022, RO decision is not warranted, and the Veteran's appeal is granted.

The Veteran asserts that the appellee should not have received any attorney fees based on the grant of service connection for a psychiatric disability. The Veteran's current attorney representative asserts two arguments. First, that because the appellee lost his accreditation legal fees should not have been withheld. The Board notes that it is on this basis that the RO in the fee decision on appeal found it necessary to refer the case to OGC for a reasonableness determination. Second, the Veteran asserts that the criteria for eligibility was not met because the November 2022 grant of service connection for a psychiatric disability was the initial decision based on an initial claim.

As will be discussed in further detail below, the Board finds that the criteria for eligibility to attorney fees was not met as the November 2022 grant of service connection for the Veteran's psychiatric disability was an initial decision on an initial claim; therefore, the Veteran's appeal is granted. Further, as eligibility to attorney fees must first be established in order for the appeal to be referred to OGC for a reasonableness determination, the Board need not, and will not address the matter of reasonableness.

Legal Criteria

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5904.

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA. The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 (a). A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time. Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 (f)(1).

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney. To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined. Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits. A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g).

Fee agreements must be reasonable; those which do not exceed 20 percent of past-due benefits are presumed reasonable. See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (f). When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim. A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636 (h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3). The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran. See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection. The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision. If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3)(i).

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1); see also Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28 (2023).

Analysis

Historically, the Veteran and the appellee signed, countersigned, and filed, a VA form 21-22a and a fee agreement on September 22, 2010.The appellee, on behalf of the Veteran, submitted a claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability to include as secondary to service-connected disabilities on September 23, 2010. The Veteran and the appellee and signed a filed a Fee Agreement on November 15, 2013. On June 2, 2022, the Veteran and his current attorney representative signed and filed a VA Form 21-22a.

The RO issued a rating decision on November 15, 2022, granting service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood with an evaluation of 30 percent effective September 22, 2010. On November 18, 2022, the RO issued a fee decision finding that the requirements for eligibility to attorney fees based on the November 2022 RO decision were met by the appellee but also found that referral for a reasonableness determination by the Office of General Counsel (OGC) was necessary. The Veteran appealed the fee decision.

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that attorney fees are not warranted as the record does not contain an initial decision denying entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, followed by continuous pursuit. The November 2022 decision granting the Veteran's initial claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability was the grant of the benefit sought by the Veteran's September 22, 2010, claim. As such, the record lacks a triggering event for the award of fees, and further a request for review was not filed. See Held, 37 Vet. App. at 28.

In sum, the criteria for eligibility to attorney fees based on the past-due benefits to the Veteran granted as a result of the November 2022 decision have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636. The Veteran's appeal is granted.
