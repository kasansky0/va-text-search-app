DATE: April 3, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to additional backpay for service connection for right ankle tendonitis, obstructive sleep apnea, right hip condition, acute intermittent tension headaches, right hip limited extension, and right hip limited flexion, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from April 1980 to December 1995.

The rating decision underlying the present appeal was issued in July 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.   Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the July 2023 rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to additional backpay for service connection for right ankle tendonitis, obstructive sleep apnea, right hip condition, acute intermittent tension headaches, right hip limited extension, and right hip limited flexion, is remanded.

In July 2023, the Veteran was granted service connection for right ankle tendonitis, obstructive sleep apnea, right hip condition, acute intermittent tension headaches, right hip limited extension, and right hip limited flexion.  The effective date of the Veteran's award was May 15, 2023, and the Veteran's combined disability rating was raised from 60 percent to 90 percent from that date.  It is unclear upon review of the Veteran's file if he was paid the additional compensation he was entitled to based upon the increase in his combined disability rating.

On remand, the RO should perform an audit of the Veteran's account. This audit should be sent to the Veteran along with a memo and summary of the audit, explaining the breakdown of his payments.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Perform an audit of the Veteran's account.

2. Send the Veteran a copy of the audit along with a memo and summary of the audit, explaining the breakdown of his payments. The RO should also indicate the amounts paid for the Veteran's retroactive award of his right ankle tendonitis, obstructive sleep apnea, right hip condition, acute intermittent tension headaches, right hip limited extension, and right hip limited flexion.

*During the course of performing the audit, if VA finds the Veteran has not been paid all the money he is entitled to, the Veteran should be compensated appropriately.

*Do NOT simply send the Veteran a copy of the audit without an explanation and breakdown of the amounts paid.
