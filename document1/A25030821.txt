ORDER

Entitlement to restoration of a 40 percent disability rating for service-connected left knee anterior cruciate ligament tear with limitation of extension is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In the December 2023 rating decision, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) proposed to reduce the rating assigned to the Veteran's service-connected left knee anterior cruciate ligament tear with limitation of extension from 40 percent disabling to noncompensable.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim of entitlement to restoration of a 40 percent disability rating for service-connected left knee anterior cruciate ligament tear with limitation of extension are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from July 1996 to July 2000.

By a December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ proposed to decrease the rating assigned to the Veteran's service-connected left knee anterior cruciate ligament tear with limitation of extension from 40 percent disabling to noncompensable.  The Veteran submitted a January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), electing Direct Review of his claim.

Entitlement to restoration of a 40 percent disability rating for service-connected left knee anterior cruciate ligament tear with limitation of extension.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  For the reasons discussed below, the Board must dismiss this appeal.

As noted above, in a December 2023 rating decision the AOJ proposed to decrease the rating assigned to the Veteran's service-connected left knee anterior cruciate ligament tear with limitation of extension from 40 percent disabling to noncompensable.  In response, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (NOD) in January 2024.  

From this, there was a proposal in the December 2023 rating decision to reduce the rating assigned to the Veteran's service-connected left knee anterior cruciate ligament tear with limitation of extension from 40 percent disabling to noncompensable.  The Veteran's January 2024 VA Form 10182 was in response to a proposed reduction.  However, this is not an appealable decision, as it is not a final action by the AOJ.  

As such, at the time of the Veteran's January 2024 VA Form 10182, there was no initial decision with regard to the reduction of the rating assigned to the Veteran's service-connected left knee anterior cruciate ligament tear with limitation of extension.  The identified December 2023 rating decision is not an appealable decision under 38 U.S.C. § 511, as a proposed reduction does not

decide any questions of law or fact.  Accordingly, the reduction issue is dismissed as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
