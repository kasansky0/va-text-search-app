ORDER

Entitlement to a 30 percent initial disability rating, but no higher, for service-connected for asthma is granted, subject to the applicable regulations concerning the payment of monetary benefits.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service-connected asthma is characterized by regular use of corticosteroids, without FEV-1 of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a 30 percent initial rating, but no higher, for service-connected asthma have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6602.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2019 to February 2023. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision of a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the initial rating for asthma, most recently addressed in a February 2023 rating decision.  In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

Finally, the Board notes that subsequent to the rating decision on appeal and receipt of the Veteran's May 2024 VA Form 10182, the RO issued a June 2024 rating decision granting the Veteran an increased rating, to 30 percent effective April 11, 2023, for his service-connected asthma.  Because, however, this award does not constitute a full grant of all benefits sought on appeal and is not effective the entirety of the appeals period, this issue remains in appellate status.  

Entitlement to a compensable initial disability rating for service-connected asthma

The Veteran seeks a compensable initial rating for service-connected asthma.  He asserts this disability results in more impairment than is contemplated by a noncompensable rating, and an increased rating is therefore warranted.  

Disability evaluations are based upon the average impairment of earning capacity as contemplated by the schedule for rating disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  In adjudicating increased rating claims, the level of disability in all periods since the effective date of the grant of service connection must be taken into account, to include the possibility that a staged rating may be assigned.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  As such, the Board will consider whether staged ratings are appropriate to the pending appeals.  In cases in which a reasonable doubt arises as to the appropriate degree of disability to be assigned, such doubt shall be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Veteran's service-connected asthma is rated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 6602, for bronchial asthma.  DC 6602 rates the severity of pulmonary disorders based primarily on objective numerical results of pulmonary function testing (PFT).  Asthma is evaluated using the following tests: (1) Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV-1) and (2) the ratio of FEV-1 to Forced Vital Capacity (FEV-1/FVC).  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.  Under DC 6602, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for FEV-1 of 71 to 80 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent, or intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy.  A 30 percent disability evaluation is assigned where there is FEV-1 of 56 to 70 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy.  A 60 percent rating is assigned for an FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least 3 times per year) course of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids.  A maximum 100 percent rating is assigned for bronchial asthma with an FEV-1of less than 40 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, or more than 1 attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure, or requires daily use of systemic (oral or parenteral) high dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6602.  In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent rating for a diagnostic code, a zero percent rating shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

PFT results are generally reported before and after the administration of bronchodilator therapy.  VA regulations instruct that post-bronchodilator results be used when considering PFT criteria for ratings under DCs 6600, 6603, 6604, 6825-6833, and 6840-6845.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(4).  There are no regulations identifying whether pre- or post-bronchodilator results should be used when determining disability ratings under DC 6602.  As 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(4) does not explicitly apply to DC 6602, the Board will use the pulmonary function test results that allow the most favorable disability rating to the Veteran.  

Crucially, DC 6602 distinguishes between "inhalational" therapy and "systemic" therapy.  Specifically, if no more than "inhalational" therapy is required, a 10 or 30 percent disability rating is assigned.  If treatment requires "systemic" corticosteroid therapy, higher ratings are assigned depending on frequency of use.  

Upon receipt of the Veteran's claim, he was afforded a November 2022 VA examination.  He was not noted to require any medication at that time, to include intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy.  PFT results included FEV-1 of 91 percent predicted and FEV-1/FVC of 92 percent predicted pre-bronchodilator.  Post-bronchodilator, FEV-1 was 85 percent predicted, and FEV-1/FVC was 90 percent predicted value.  

On VA examination in May 2023, the Veteran reported use of albuterol and Advair.  He reported use of these medications following service separation in February 2023, upon being seen at a VA medical facility.  He also reported use of Wixela, a corticosteroid, on a daily basis for his shortness of breath.  PFT results included FEV-1 of 99 percent predicted and FEV-1/FVC of 108 percent predicted pre-bronchodilator.  Post-bronchodilator testing FEV-1 of 102 percent predicted and FEV-1/FVC of 107 percent predicted.  

After considering the entirety of the record, the Board finds the evidence persuasively supports a 30 percent disability rating for the entirety of the appeals period, as the Veteran has reported, and VA treatment records confirm, daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy since service separation in February 2023.  As such, a 30 percent rating is warranted from service separation based on this use of a corticosteroid.  The evidence is also, however, against a disability rating in excess of 30 percent.  At no time during the pendency of the appeal has the Veteran demonstrated an FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least 3 times per year) course of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids.  While the Veteran does use a corticosteroid, both the November 2022 and May 2023 VA examination noted this use was not systemic.  PFT results also do indicate respiratory impairment as would warrant a 60 percent rating.  

For the foregoing reasons, an increased initial rating of 30 percent, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's service-connected asthma.  The evidence of record also, however, persuasively weighs against an initial rating in excess of 30 percent at any time during the pendency of the appeal.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a higher rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
