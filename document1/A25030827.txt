REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1984 to October 1988, February 1990 to April 1998, January 2003 to January 2004, and from January 2005 to May 2005.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

On April 12, 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) electing a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge. He appeared for a hearing before the undersigned on October 28, 2024; a transcript of the hearing is of record.

Consideration can only be given to the evidence of record at the time of the RO decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative within 90 days of the hearing, i.e., October 28, 2024. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. The Board cannot consider (1) evidence submitted during the period after the RO issued the decision on appeal and before the VA Form 10182 was received, or (2) evidence submitted more than 90 days after the hearing. Id. The period to submit evidence has now closed. 

This case has been advanced on the docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §20.902 (c).

PROHIBITED CONCURRENT ELECTIONS

When a claim is denied under the AMA, a claimant may either elect to submit a Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or submit an appeal to the Board. A claimant cannot elect multiple review options simultaneously for the same claim. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2501. Such concurrent election is specifically prohibited by 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b), which states, "[A] claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under paragraph (a) of this section may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option."

1. Entitlement to service connection for scars right lower leg is dismissed.

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for scars, right lower leg, must be dismissed because results from a prohibited concurrent election under the modernized review system. On December 12, 2019, the RO issued a rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for a scar, right lower leg. In response, the Veteran filed a NOD on July 20, 2020, and elected direct review by a VLJ, under Docket No. 200720-98165. Subsequent to the above NOD the Veteran filed an October 27, 2022, VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim of the December 12, 2019, rating decision which resulted in the March 2023 rating decision on appeal that continued to deny the claim. In response, the Veteran filed the April 12, 2023, NOD on appeal. 

The resulting appeal, with respect to entitlement to service connection for a scar, right lower leg was erroneously docketed by the Board. While the July 20, 2020, NOD was pending, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim of the December 12, 2019, rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for a scar, right lower leg. The Veteran had not attempted to withdraw his prior request, and the appeal had not been resolved before the April 12, 2023, VA Form 10182 was received. 

The Veteran's claim for service connection for a scar, right lower extremity, was adjudicated and denied in the aforementioned separate August 6, 2024, Board decision under Docket No. 200720-98165 in connection with the July 20, 2020, NOD.

As the present appeal for the service connection claim for a scar, right lower leg, is a concurrent election prohibited under controlling law and regulation, the appeal as to this claim must be dismissed. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left arm disability is dismissed.

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for a left arm disability must be dismissed because it results from a prohibited concurrent election under the modernized review system. 

Historically, the Veteran filed for entitlement to service connection for a bilateral arm disability resulting in a June 10, 2016, rating decision that denied the same. The Veteran appealed that decision in a June 22, 2016, NOD. While the Veteran's appeal was pending, the Veteran opted into the AMA in a March 31, 2018, RAMP election, seeking higher-level review of his pending appeals, to include entitlement to service connection for a bilateral arm disability.

On October 9, 2020, the RO issued a rating decision denying service connection for a left arm disability. In response, the Veteran filed a NOD on November 18, 2020, and elected a hearing by a VLJ, under Docket No. 201118-125147. The Veteran testified before the undersigned in October 2024; a transcript of the hearing is of record. Subsequent to the above NOD the Veteran filed multiple additional NODs and supplemental claims, which resulted in the rating decision on appeal. 

Here, while the November 18, 2020, NOD was pending, the Veteran filed a July 27, 2022, VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim of a June 14, 2016, rating decision which the RO continued to deny the claim in the March 2023 rating decision on appeal. The appeal stemming from the April 12, 2023, VA Form 10182, with respect to entitlement to service connection a left arm disability was erroneously docketed by the Board. The Veteran had not attempted to withdraw his prior request, and the appeal had not been resolved before the April 12, 2023, VA Form 10182 was received. As the present appeal for the service connection claim for a left arm disability is a concurrent election prohibited under controlling law and regulation, the appeal as to these claims must be dismissed.

The Veteran's claim for service connection for a left arm disability was adjudicated and granted in the aforementioned separate Board decision under Docket No. 201118-125147 in connection with the November 18, 2020, NOD. The Board finds that the Veteran is not prejudiced by dismissal of the claim herein and it is dismissed.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a right arm disability is dismissed.

The appeal for entitlement to service for a right arm disability must be dismissed because it results from a prohibited concurrent election under the modernized review system. On September 11, 2020, the RO issued a rating decision denying service connection for a neurologic condition affecting the right arm. In response, the Veteran filed a NOD on September 28, 2020, and elected direct review by a VLJ, under Docket No. 200928-110317. Subsequent to the above NOD the Veteran filed multiple additional NODs and supplemental claims, which resulted in the rating decision on appeal. 

Here, while the September 28, 2020, NOD was pending, the Veteran filed a July 27, 2022, VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim of a November 3, 2020, rating decision. The appeal stemming from the April 12, 2023, VA Form 10182, with respect to entitlement to service connection a right arm disability was erroneously docketed by the Board. In a December 2024 Board decision under Docket No. 201118-125147 determined the November 3, 2020, rating decision resulted from an impermissible concurrent election of the aforementioned September 11, 2020, rating decision. The Veteran had not attempted to withdraw his prior request, and the appeal had not been resolved before the April 12, 2023, VA Form 10182 was received. As the present appeal for the service connection claim for right arm disability is a concurrent election prohibited under controlling law and regulation, the appeal as to these claims must be dismissed.

The Veteran's claim for service connection for a right arm disability was disability was adjudicated and granted in the aforementioned separate Board decision under Docket No. 200928-110317 in connection with the September 28, 2020, NOD. The Board finds that the Veteran is not prejudiced by dismissal of the claim herein and it is dismissed.
