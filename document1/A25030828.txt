REMANDED

Service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1988 to November 1992.

In a July 2023 rating decision, the Veteran sought service connection for sleep impairment and depression claimed as secondary to pain from his service-connected right knee disability. 

In an August 2023 claim, the Veteran sought service connection for PTSD. 

In a November 2023 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), granted service connection for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress, to include sleep disturbances associated with right knee pain. The RO denied service connection for PTSD. 

In August 2024 the Veteran appealed the denial of service connection for PTSD to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal. The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. However, as a remand of this is warranted, any such evidence will be considered by the AOJ on remand.

1. Service connection for PTSD is remanded.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for PTSD.

VA has a duty to assist claimants to obtain evidence needed to substantiate a claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c). The Board has a duty to remand issues when necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error, or to correct any other error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

The AOJ did not obtain a VA PTSD examination.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has noted that VA is obliged to provide an examination or obtain a medical opinion in a claim for service connection when the record contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability or signs and symptoms of a current disability, there is evidence of an event, injury, or disease in service, the record indicates that the disability or signs and symptoms of disability may be associated with active service, and the record does not contain sufficient information to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). The types of evidence that indicate that a current disability may be associated with military service include, but are not limited to, medical evidence that suggests a nexus but is too equivocal or lacking in specificity to support a decision on the merits, or credible evidence of continuity of symptomatology such as pain or other symptoms capable of lay observation. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83. For purposes of determining whether an examination or opinion is warranted, the threshold for finding a link between current disability and service is low. Locklear v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 410 (2006); McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83.

In August 2023, the Veteran filed VA 21-0781, Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for PTSD. He claimed that his PTSD was caused by an incident that occurred on August 6, 1990 while stationed on the USS Gridley. He contends that he fell off a ladder during a typhoon and fell three decks, landing on deck plates.

In VA treatment in August 2023, the Veteran reported sustaining injury in an accident in service. He related psychiatric symptoms including anxiety and depression that he related to the event in service. A clinician found that the Veteran had severe symptoms of PTSD. In September 2023 treatment notes, PTSD was included in a list of the Veteran's problems.

The medical evidence indicates that the Veteran has signs or symptoms of PTSD. The Veteran has competently described an in-service stressor, which the RO did not attempt to verify. The record meets the low threshold for indicating that injury in service may be associated with events in service. Therefore VA was obliged to provide an examination. The Board finds that the RO's failure to verify the in-service stressor and failure obtain an examination was pre-decisional duty-to-assist error. Thus, remand is warranted.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Attempt to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressor as described on page 4 of his August 2023 VA 21-0781, Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for PTSD.

2. Then, schedule the Veteran for a VA PTSD examination. The examination report must reflect that the claims file was reviewed. 

(a)	Does the Veteran have PTSD? Why or why not?

(b)	If yes, the examiner is to provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's PTSD is related to an event or events during his active service. 

If PTSD is diagnosed, the examiner must identify the stressor(s) supporting the diagnosis. The claimed stressor is listed on page 4 of the August 2023 VA 21-0781, Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for PTSD.

The examiner's attention is invited to August 2023 VA mental treatment records that contains a diagnosis of PTSD. [CAPRI, Receipt date October 4, 2023]

A complete rationale must be provided for any and all opinions offered.
