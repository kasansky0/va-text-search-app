FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The January 24, 2025, rating decision proposing to reduce the Veteran's bladder cancer rating from 100 percent to 20 percent disabling did not constitute a final, appealable decision.

2. The January 24, 2025, rating decision proposing to discontinue entitlement to SMC housebound did not constitute a final, appealable decision.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the January 24, 2025, rating decision proposing to reduce the Veteran's bladder cancer rating from 100 percent to 20 percent have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. 

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the January 24, 2025, rating decision proposing to discontinue the Veteran's entitlement to SMC housebound have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran honorably served in the United States Army from August 1969 to August 1971.

1. The appeal of a proposed rating reduction for service-connected bladder cancer from 100 percent to 20 percent disabling is dismissed.

2. The appeal of the proposed discontinuation of SMC housebound is dismissed. 

Historically, the Veteran has been in receipt of a 100 percent rating for his service-connected bladder disability and SMC housebound. See August 2022, March 2023, and October 2023 Rating Decisions. In a January 24, 2025, rating decision, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), proposed a reduction of the Veteran's bladder cancer rating from 100 percent to 20 percent and discontinuance of the Veteran's SMC at the statutory housebound rate. The Veteran was notified of same in a January 27, 2025, letter. The Veteran's February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD) identified the proposed rating reduction and discontinuance of SMC housebound as the issues on appeal and lists the date of the January 27, 2025, letter. 

A NOD, or VA Form 10182, may only be filed with respect to an "adjudication of a specific entitlement as described in 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(c)." See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). The January 24, 2025, proposals did not constitute adjudication of entitlement, rather, they are proposals for future adjudication. See Hargrove v. Shinseki, 629 F.3d 1377, 1379-81 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (affirming a dismissal of a writ recognizing the AOJ decision proposing a reduction is not a final decision and the Veteran had not yet exhausted administrative remedies); see also Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 461 (2011) (holding a deferred decision does not constitute an "adjudicative determination" from which a notice of disagreement may be filed). 

In dismissing the Veteran's appeals, the Board observes that the time to change Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) dockets has not elapsed. 38 U.S.C. § 7101(a); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). A brief from the Veteran's representative regarding the current appeals is also not of record. However, as the AOJ's January 2024 proposed reduction of the Veteran's bladder cancer rating from 100 percent to 20 percent and discontinuance of the Veteran's SMC at the statutory housebound rate are not final, appealable decisions, it was an administrative error for the Board to accept the Veteran's February 2025 appeals of same. Because the Board has no choice but to dismiss the appeals as a matter of law, there is thus no prejudice or harm to the Veteran in proceeding with same. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2)(A).
