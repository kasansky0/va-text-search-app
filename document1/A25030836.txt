DOCKET NO. 240720-457063
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's restrictive lung disease (claimed as respiratory conditions) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's restrictive lung disease is related to her toxic exposure risk activities during military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for restrictive lung disease have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from October 1998 to October 2002. 

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (hereinafter Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ)) in the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for restrictive lung disease, which was most recently addressed in a January 2024 rating decision. In July 2024, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which implicitly found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the July 2024 supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300,?20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for restrictive lung disease

The Veteran contends that her diagnosed restrictive lung disease is related to her toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) during service as an Aviation Supply Specialist, stocking hazardous material and airplane equipment, inspecting packages, packing and shipping packages, and inhaling fuel when delivering items to the flight line and various aviation squadrons. See Veteran's May 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim. The Board finds that service connection for restrictive lung disease is warranted. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, which includes but is not limited to equipoise, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.

In this case, the AOJ made a favorable finding in the July 2024 supplemental claim decision that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of restrictive lung disease based on the results of a September 2023 VA examination. Therefore, the first element required to establish service connection has been met.

The second element required to establish service connection has also been met because the evidence of record, including a March 2024 TERA Memo, supports that the Veteran participated in a TERA during active military service. Specifically, as an aviation supply specialist, the Veteran was noted to have been exposed to weapons cleaning CLP, grease, oil, hydraulic fluid, diesel and JP-8 fuel, and exhaust fumes. 

And finally, the third element required to establish service connection has also been met with medical evidence that establishes a nexus between the Veteran's in-service TERA participation and her diagnosed restrictive lung disease. In an April 2024 VA medical opinion, the examiner made a clerical error in Section VIII - Medical Opinion for TERA by checking box 8B instead of box 8A. The text of the examiner's opinion and rationale, however, unmistakably establishes that the examiner found it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's diagnosed restrictive lung disease was related to her TERA participation in service. The examiner stated that the current medical literature supports toxic exposure being causative of restrictive lung disease. The examiner further stated that the Veteran did not have risk factors outside of her military service (such as hereditary factors, congenital factors, a smoking history, or weight factors) that outweighed the risk factors identified in the TERA Memo. The examiner concluded that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's restrictive lung disease is related to her military service. 

Accordingly, given the evidence establishing the three elements required for service connection, entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's diagnosed restrictive lung disease is warranted, and the claim is granted.
