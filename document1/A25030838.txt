ORDER

The Appellant is not eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past due benefits awarded in the July 12, 2022 rating decision, which awarded entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU), effective May 14, 2021; the appeal is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's appointment of the Appellant as his attorney representative and the associated fee agreement are valid.

2. A June 2021 rating decision expressly deferred adjudication of the issue of entitlement to a TDIU pending receipt of a VA Form 21-8940.

3. The July 12, 2022 rating decision, which awarded entitlement to a TDIU, effective May 14, 2021, was the initial decision with respect to the case.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in the July 2022 rating decision are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1992 to October 1995.  

The Appellant is the Veteran's former attorney representative.  See e.g., September 15, 2022 third party correspondence (withdrawing as the Veteran's representative).

The fee decision on appeal was issued on July 13, 2022 and constitutes an initial decision of the issue of fees warranted from the July 12, 2022 rating decision.  

In the August 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  The Veteran did not elect to change the docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 13, 2022 fee decision on appeal, any brief or argument filed by the Veteran if received within 30 days of the December 6, 2024, notice of the substance of the NOD.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.404, 20.405.

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904.

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22, "Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative," or VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative," is required to represent a claimant before VA.  The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a).  A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time.  Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1).

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.  A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case.  This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1).  Agents and attorneys may charge fees for representation provided with respect to a request for revision of a decision of an AOJ or the Board based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) if notice of the challenged decision on a claim or claims was issued on or after the effective date of the modernized review system, and the agent or attorney has complied with the power of attorney requirements in 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 and the fee agreement requirements in 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(c)(1).

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).  

Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded shall be presumed to be reasonable if the agent or attorney provided representation that continued through the date of the decision awarding benefits.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f)(1).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  The fees are payable to the attorney based on the past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020).

A supplemental claim filed more than a year after the initial rating decision is part of the original case, and an attorney may charge fees for representation provided in filing that supplemental claim.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110, 1138-1141 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In Chisholm v. Collins, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that that a VA Form 21-8940 received within one year of a rating decision adjudicating the evaluations assigned for a service-connected disability or disabilities, constitutes a Supplemental Claim for purposes of continuous pursuit because a Supplemental Claim does not need to be filed solely using a VA Form 20-0995. 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (Mar. 13, 2025).

On May 14, 2021 the Veteran and Appellant executed a VA Form 21-22a appointing the Appellant as his representative.  On April 19, 2021, the parties executed a fee agreement, which provided the Appellant was entitled to 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran.  

First, the Board finds that based on the evidence of record, the fee agreement between the Veteran and the Appellant is valid per the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).  In the present case, the written fee agreement was signed by both the Veteran and the Appellant and was received by VA within the 30-day requirement.  It includes the Veteran's name, her VA file number, states the Appellant is entitled to 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran, and that the fee is to be paid directly by VA from any past-due benefits awarded.  Accordingly, the Board finds the fee agreement is valid.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).

Turning to the procedural history of the claim, a March 2015 rating decision granted service connection for persistent depressive disorder (hereinafter depressive disorder) and assigned a 30 percent evaluation, effective May 19, 2014. 

In May 2021, the Appellant filed multiple VA Forms 21-526EZ requesting an increased evaluation for the Veteran's depressive disorder.  See May 14, 2021 and May 19, 2021. 

A June 2021 rating decision awarded a 70 percent evaluation for the Veteran's depressive disorder and deferred adjudication of entitlement to a TDIU. 

In August 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940, Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability citing inter alia his depressive disorder as the cause of his inability to work.  

In June 2022, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR), requesting review of the evaluation assigned for the Veteran's depressive disorder in the June 2021 rating decision, which was issued to the Veteran via a July 1, 2021 notification letter.  In an attached correspondence, the Appellant again expressly raised the issue of entitlement to a TDIU as part and parcel of the Veteran's HLR request.  See June 24, 2022 correspondence. 

A July 12, 2022 rating decision awarded entitlement to a TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance, effective May 14, 2021, confirmed and continued the Veteran's evaluations for his service connected disabilities, and denied entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee arthritis.  

The July 2022 fee decision on appeal denied eligibility to the payment of fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the July 2022 rating decision noting "the retroactive amount of past-due benefits is not a result of a favorable decision resulting from the supplemental claim being under review for an initial decision on an initial claim for an increase in rate of benefit for a previously granted appealed service condition or downstream issue which arises as a direct result of a favorable decision on an appealed issue."  

In August 2022, the Appellant filed a VA Form 10182 asserting that fees were warranted because the TDIU was awarded secondary to the Veteran's psychiatric impairment, which was on appeal.  

As noted above, the Board finds that the Veteran's appointment of the Appellant as his attorney and the associated fee agreement are valid.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).  Additionally, the Board notes the establishment of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance, the denial of the Veteran's increased rating claims, and the denial of entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee arthritis did not result in an award of past-due benefits.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  Therefore, the only issue from which the Appellant could receive fees is for the grant of TDIU.  

Accordingly, the remaining inquiry is whether the July 2022 rating decision was the initial decision with respect to the case for entitlement to a TDIU.  After a review of the claims file, the Board finds the July 2022 rating decision was the initial decision with respect to the case as no prior decision had adjudicated, expressly or implicitly, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU.  Although the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is part of an increased rating claim because it is "another pathway 'to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability or disabilities,'" see De Hart v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 371, 380 (2024), it is a separate and distinct benefit and issue.  See also Id. (acknowledging that the Veteran can "file a 'freestanding claim' for TDIU," but is not required to do so).

Accordingly, under the facts of this case, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, while part of an increased rating claim, was a distinct case/issue as contemplated by 38 U.S.C.S. § 5904(c)(1).  The AOJ exercised its discretion and bifurcated the determinations regarding the schedular rating for the Veteran's service-connected depressive disorder, which was inter alia cited as a cause of his inability to work, from the issue of entitlement to a TDIU (whether a total rating for unavailability is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16, rather than under the specific provisions of the Rating Schedule).  See June 28, 2021 rating decision (stating the "issue of whether or not you are entitled to Individual Unemployability is deferred for the following: VA Form 21-8940").  

The Board again acknowledges that a TDIU claim "is inextricably tied to the proper rating of the service-connected condition claim or claims to which it attaches."  See De Hart, supra, 14-15.  Nevertheless, it involves separate and distinct factual and legal determinations.  Namely, whether the "veteran's earning capacity has been reduced to zero [due to an inability to work] despite not being "entitled to a 100% schedular rating" for a service-connected disability or disabilities.  Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) (noting that "Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. . ."; emphasis added); 4.16(b) (further noting "It is the established policy of [VA] that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities (emphasis added) shall be rated totally disabled."); cf. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (a singular disability (emphasis added) that does not take into account other functional impairments from other service-connected disabilities, for example, his intervertebral disc syndrome with bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy and fibromyalgia rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DCs 5025-5243).  

Given the express deferral of the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, the June 2021 rating decision cannot be construed as the initial decision with respect to the TDIU case/issue.  As such, the Board finds that the July 2022 rating decision was the AOJ's "initial decision with respect to the case." 

In so finding, the Board acknowledges that a VA Form 21-8940 "can serve as a supplemental claim when filed after VA denies higher ratings" for the cited disability or disabilities previously adjudicated in a rating decision in the one-year prior to receipt of the TDIU application.  Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, at *2-3 (Vet. App. Mar. 13, 2025).  Nevertheless, in the present case, because the issue of entitlement to a TDIU was expressly deferred in the June 2021 rating decision "a claim for the same or similar benefits [a TDIU] on the same or similar basis" had not been "previously decided."  Id. at 17-18.  Accordingly, in this instance the VA Form 21-8940 cannot serve as a supplemental claim with respect to the issue of entitlement to a TDIU. 

The Board also acknowledges the Appellant's assertion that there was a pending "appeal" regarding the Veteran's depressive disorder evaluation, which was assigned in a June 2021 rating decision, at the time of the issuance of the July 2022 rating decision.  See September 13, 2022 Third Party Correspondence.  Nevertheless, because the June 2021 rating decision had expressly deferred adjudication of entitlement to a TDIU-rather than expressly or implicitly denied TDIU benefits-the June 24, 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, did not encompass the TDIU claim or anyway change the fact there had been no "initial decision with respect to the [TDIU] case."  

Simply put, there was only one decision adjudicating the issue of entitlement to a TDIU (a benefit adjudicated and assigned under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16-a benefit noted that can be for an individual or collective impairment due to service-connected disability(ies) and is under Part 4, Subpart A-and not assigned under the Part 4, Subpart B, Disability Ratings (i.e., Individual Disability Ratings Schedule)) and that decision resulted in the grant of benefits.  

In sum, the July 2022 rating decision was the "initial decision with respect to the case" because entitlement to a TDIU had never previously been adjudicated, expressly or implicitly, by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1).  As such, "a fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid" because the Appellant's services regarding the TDIU case were provided before the date on which the Veteran was provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision under section 38 U.S.C. § 5104.  Id.  

Accordingly, the Appellant is not eligible for the direct payment of fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the July 2022 rating decision.  The appeal is denied.
