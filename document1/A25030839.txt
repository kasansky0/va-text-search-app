ORDER

Entitlement to an apportionment of the Veteran's Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits in excess of $550.00 per month to the appellant, on behalf of herself, K.F., S.F., and P.F., is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A January 2022 apportionment decision granted an apportionment of the Veteran's VA compensation benefits to the appellant, on behalf of herself and the parties' children K.F., S.F., and P.F., in the amount of $550.00 per month. 

2. During the review period at issue, a monthly apportionment in excess of $550.00 would result in undue hardship to the Veteran. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an apportionment of the Veteran's VA compensation benefits in excess of $550.00 per month to the appellant, on behalf of herself, K.F., S.F., and P.F., have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5307; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.450, 3.451, 3.452, 3.458. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 2003 to March 2006. The appellant is the mother of the parties' children, K.F., S.F., and P.F. 

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2022 decision of a VA Regional Office (RO), which denied the appellant's claim for an increased apportionment of the Veteran's VA compensation benefits, on behalf of herself, K.F., S.F. and P.F. 

In the September 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket. The Veteran did not elect to change the docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.405. Thus, as evidence was submitted by both parties during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, the Board has as not considered it in its decision.   

As an initial matter, the Board acknowledges that the AOJ reduced the Veteran's VA compensation benefits due to incarceration, effective October 10, 2022. See February 28, 2023, VA correspondence. Additionally, the AOJ terminated the $100.00 per month apportionment to the appellant, on her own behalf, effective February 1, 2023, the first of the month following the parties' divorce. See May 2023 apportionment decision. Lastly, the Board acknowledges that K.F. reached adulthood during the pendency of this appeal as she turned 18 years old in August 2023 and was removed from the Veteran's award of benefits as of the date of her 18th birthday. However, the review period for consideration in the instant appeal is from May 2022, the date of the appellant's claim for an increased apportionment, to July 18, 2022, the date the decision on appeal was issued. 

Entitlement to an increase in apportionment of the Veteran's VA compensation benefits. 

The law limits the payment of compensation to persons incarcerated for a felony conviction. The law specifically provides, in relevant part, that any person entitled to compensation who is incarcerated in a state penal institution for a period in excess of 60 days for the conviction of a felony committed after October 7, 1980, shall not be paid such compensation for the period beginning on the 61st day of such incarceration and ending on the day such incarceration ends. In the case of a veteran with service-connected disability rated at 20 percent or more, he shall not be paid an amount in excess of the rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(a), which is at the rate of 10 percent. 38 U.S.C. § 5313; 38 C.F.R. § 3.665. All or part of the compensation not paid to an incarcerated veteran may be apportioned to the veteran's spouse, child or children and dependent parents on the basis of individual need. In determining individual need, consideration shall be given to such factors as the apportionee claimant's income and living expenses, the amount of compensation available to be apportioned, and the needs and living expenses of other apportionee claimants, if any. 38 C.F.R. § 3.665(e)(1).

VA regulations provide for two types of apportionments. The first type is a "general" apportionment, which may be paid under the circumstances set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.450. More specifically, all or any part of the compensation payable on account of any veteran may be apportioned if the veteran is not residing with his spouse or children, and the veteran is not reasonably discharging his responsibility for the spouse's or children's support. 38 U.S.C. § 5307(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.450(a)(1)(ii). No apportionment will be made where the veteran is providing for his dependents. 38 C.F.R. § 3.450(c). It is not necessary for the claimant to establish the existence of hardship in order to obtain an apportionment under 38 C.F.R. § 3.450. See Hall v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 294 (1993).

The second type is a "special" apportionment. Under this type of apportionment, without regard to any other provision regarding apportionment, where hardship is shown to exist, compensation may be specially apportioned between the veteran and his dependents on the basis of the facts of the individual case as long as it does not cause undue hardship to the other persons in interest. In determining the basis for special apportionment, consideration is to be given to such factors as the amount of VA benefits payable, other income and resources of the veteran and those dependents in whose behalf the apportionment is claimed, and the special needs of the veteran, his dependents, and the apportionment claimants. The amount apportioned should generally be consistent with the total number of dependents involved.

Ordinarily, apportionment of more than 50 percent of the veteran's benefits would constitute undue hardship on him or her, while apportionment of less than 20 percent of his or her benefits would not provide a reasonable amount for any apportionee. 38 C.F.R. § 3.451. A veteran cannot prevail on a claim of hardship when he or she is receiving additional benefit for a dependent and the apportioned amount is no more than those additional benefits. See Hall, 5 Vet. App. at 295.

Both types of apportionments (either "general" or "special" apportionment) are payable to a spouse or a dependent. 38 U.S.C. § 5307(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.450(a)(1)(ii), 3.451. A veteran's benefits may be apportioned if a veteran is not residing with his spouse or children, and a claim for apportionment is filed for or on behalf of the spouse or children. 38 C.F.R. § 3.452(a). A veteran's benefits will not be apportioned where the total benefit payable to the disabled person does not permit payment of a reasonable amount to any apportionee. 38 C.F.R. § 3.458(a).

The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply in apportionment cases because it is impossible to give the benefit of the doubt to a veteran and a claimant simultaneously. Elias v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 259 (1997).

In a January 2022 decision, the AOJ granted an apportionment to the appellant, on behalf of herself and the parties' children K.F., S.F., and P.F., in the amount of $550.00 per month. Specifically, the AOJ awarded $150.00 per month for each of the minor children and $100.00 per month for the appellant. No appeal was received within the time allowed for appeals of contested claims; thus, this decision became final. 

In May 2022, the appellant filed a claim for an increase in the apportionment amount awarded, which was denied in a July 2022 decision. The appellant filed the instant appeal. Specifically, she contends that the apportionment amount awarded is insufficient. 

The Board reiterates that the review period for consideration of the claim for an increased apportionment of the Veteran's VA compensation benefits is from May 4, 2022, the date of receipt of the appellant's claim, to July 18, 2022, the date of the decision on appeal. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was charged with a felony and was held without bond during the applicable review period before the Board. However, the evidence of record does not indicate that the Veteran was convicted of a felony during the review period at issue, and his VA compensation benefits due to incarceration were not reduced until October 10, 2022, the 61st day following his felony conviction, which again is outside of applicable review period before the Board in the instant appeal. 

The Board notes that because an apportionment has already been granted, there is no need to consider the threshold requirements for entitlement to an apportionment. Rather, the pertinent question is whether the appellant is entitled to an increased apportionment amount.  

After reviewing the record, the Board finds that an increased apportionment is not warranted. 

Both parties have asserted that they face financial hardship. The appellant contended that she was working three part-time jobs, and her income did not meet her needs. She further noted that she had to borrow money from her grandparents. In a May 2022 VA Form 21-0788, the appellant reported a monthly income of $1,730.00 (her gross wages from employment and the $550.00 apportionment) and expenses of $4,200.00. The evidence of record indicates that the Veteran was receiving $3,640.92 per month in VA compensation benefits during the appeal period at issue. In a May 2022 VA Form 21-0788, the Veteran reported monthly expenses of $3,284.00. The Board notes that also considering the $550.00 apportionment, the Veteran was left with a monthly deficit of $193.08. The Board extends both parties equal credibility in reporting their financial information. These reported amounts show both the Veteran and the appellant had expenses exceeding their income and experienced financial hardship during the applicable review period. 

The Board acknowledges that the record reflects that the apportionment amount of $550.00 was less than 20 percent of the Veteran's total VA compensation benefits. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.451. However, the Board finds that any additional apportionment award would result in undue hardship to the Veteran. As previously discussed, the evidence indicates that the Veteran had a monthly deficit when considering the already awarded $550.00 per month apportionment during the period on review. Additionally, the record shows that the Veteran received dependency allowance for the appellant, K.F., S.F., and P.F. during the appeal period at issue. As the $550.00 apportionment award exceeded the amount of additional dependent benefits that the Veteran received for the appellant, K.F., S.F., and P.F., an award of additional apportionment is prohibited due to the hardship it would cause the Veteran. See Hall, 5 Vet. App. at 295.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that an increase in the amount of apportionment of the Veteran's VA compensation benefits during the review period on appeal is not warranted. According, the appellant's appeal for an apportionment in excess of $550.00 per month of the Veteran's VA compensation benefits is denied.
