CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to service connection for a left elbow disability by the appellant or the authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability by the appellant or the authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1994 to December 2014.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2020 rating decision issued by Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  On October 27, 2021, the Veteran filed a timely appeal of that decision using VA Form 10182, Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected to have a Board hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 19.2.  

A Board hearing was scheduled for April 2025.  However, in February 2025, the Board received a notice from the Veteran's attorney stating that the Veteran wanted to withdraw the hearing request for the issues of entitlement to service connection for left elbow and right knee disabilities.  38 C.F.R.§ 20.704(e). 

The February 2025 correspondence also included a request to withdraw to withdraw the appeal for those issues.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left elbow disability

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability

The Board may dismiss any appeal which does not allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the veteran or the authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In February 2025, the Veteran, through his attorney, submitted a request to withdraw the appeal of entitlement to service connection for left elbow and right knee disabilities.  That withdrawal was effective when received.  

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran has withdrawn the appeal and there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration regarding entitlement to service connection for left elbow and right knee disabilities.  

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
