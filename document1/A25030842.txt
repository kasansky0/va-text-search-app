DOCKET NO. 210209-185917
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) emergency medical services/treatment rendered from December 3, 2019 to December 5, 2019 (claim by ERN Enterprises, Inc.) is dismissed.  

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment for non-VA medical services provided to the Veteran in December 2019.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care for the Veteran in December 2019 has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant in the present case is a subsidiary team that advocates for patient healthcare, who filed the present appeal on behalf of a non-VA hospital which furnished emergency medical care to the Veteran from December 3, 2019 to December 5, 2019.  

In February 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the appellant electing the Evidence Submission docket to review a December 2020 Explanation of Payment (EOP) issued by a VA AOJ.  

Under the Evidence Submission docket, the Board will consider the evidence of record as of the date of the underlying decision appealed, evidence submitted with the February 2021 VA Form 10182, and evidence submitted within 90 days following receipt of the VA Form 10182.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7113(c); 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was added during any ineligible period, the Board did not consider it.  If the appellant wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, it may at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical emergency care provided to the Veteran in December 2019 was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  The record reflects that the claim was reprocessed and entitlement to payment was approved for the entire episode of care.  The Veteran's claims file maintained by VA contains an August 2021 letter from VA Payment Operations & Management to ERN Enterprises explaining that, upon a secondary administrative review, the episode of care beginning December 3, 2019 to December 5, 2019 was approved and paid on May 5, 2021.  The Board notes that if any amount paid were disagreeable to the appellant, they would have been able to file a separate appeal of that decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.  

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the medical care in December 2019 constitutes a reversal of the denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).
