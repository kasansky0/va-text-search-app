DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran continuously pursued the service connection claim of a psychiatric disability from the intent to file on October 10, 2017 and the associated claim on April 30, 2018.

2. The Veteran was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder in June 1989.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of October 10, 2017 for the grant of service connection for a psychiatric disability are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from April 1962 to July 1966, during Peacetime and the Vietnam War Era.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which granted service connection for a psychiatric disorder effective March 29, 2024.

In the March 2025 Board Appeal: Notice of Disagreement, VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. As such, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal (September 6, 2024). The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the decision on appeal (on or after September 7, 2024). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claims. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.

As a final initial matter, the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket, and the Board notes that the allotted time to select a different Board review option under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) and Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), which allows for a docket switch 60 days from the date of the VA Form 10182 or one year from the AOJ decision, whichever is later, has not elapsed; however, as this case is being granted in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

In this case, the AOJ has assigned the date of March 29, 2024, as the effective date for the Veteran's award of service connection for a psychiatric disability. Such date corresponds with the date of the VA examination in which the Veteran was first diagnosed with PTSD. The Veteran contends that an effective date prior to March 29, 2024, is warranted.

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Chronologically, the Veteran filed his intent to file on October 10, 2017, and his associated service connection claim on April 30, 2018. Service connection for depression was denied in a September 2018 rating decision. The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) in October 2018. The AOJ issued a statement of the case (SOC) in April 2019. In June 2019, the Veteran filed his substantive appeal (VA Form 9). In March 2020, the Board remanded the issue of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. Then, in April 2020, the Board vacated the March 2020 remand because it was inconsistent with the AMA. In April 2020, the Board again remanded the issue. In a June 2020 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for unspecified bipolar and related disorder (previously claimed as depression). In March 2021, the Veteran completed a substantive appeal (VA Form 10182), electing the Evidence Submission docket. In July 2021, the Board denied service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include bipolar disorder and unspecified depressive disorder. 

Subsequently, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim in August 2021 for an acquired psychiatric disorder. In a June 2022 rating decision, the AOJ continued the denial of service connection. The Veteran then filed a Higher-Level Review (HLR) request for the issue in July 2022. In an August 2022 rating decision, the AOJ found a duty to assist error had occurred for the issue, namely the failure to obtain federal records. In a May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ then confirmed and continued the previous denial of service connection. In June 2023, the Veteran then filed another HLR request. In a September 2023 rating decision, the AOJ confirmed and continued the previous denial of service connection. The Veteran then filed a Supplemental Claim in February 2024 concerning this issue. The AOJ then issued the September 2024 rating decision-that is the subject of this appeal.

From this, the Board finds that the Veteran has continuously pursued the psychiatric claim since his intent to file on October 10, 2017 and the associated psychiatric claim on April 30, 2018.  Furthermore, the Board notes that while the Veteran was first diagnosed with PTSD in the March 29, 2024 VA examination, the Veteran has multiple service-connected psychiatric disorders, including other specified bipolar disorder, and the Veteran was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder on June 23, 1989. See June 1989 Flagler Hospital Discharge Summary.  In fact, the Veteran's noted unspecified bipolar disorder was noted as part of the adjudicatory process throughout the pending and continuously pursued appeal stemming from the October 2017 Intent to File.  Moreover, although PTSD was diagnosed in the March 2024 VA examination, the Veteran has carried a diagnosis for unspecified bipolar disorder throughout the appeal period and the Board finds it significant that the "unspecified bipolar disorder" was including with the PTSD diagnosis in the September 2024 grant of service connection by the AOJ.  

As such, the date of claim was October 10, 2017 and the date entitlement arose was June 23, 1989. Thus, the later of the two dates is October 10, 2017. Therefore, an effective date of October 10, 2017, for the grant of service connection for a psychiatric disability is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. In so reaching the above conclusions, the Board has appropriately applied the benefit of the doubt doctrine. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).
