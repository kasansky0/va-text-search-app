DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for service-connected left knee strain including medial collateral ligament (MCL), and meniscus injury residuals, has been withdrawn.

FINDING OF FACT

On February 14, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for service-connected left knee strain including MCL, and meniscus injury residuals, by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps from August 2004 to January 2013. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Withdrawal

A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.205(b)(1). 

1. Entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for service-connected left knee strain including medial collateral ligament (MCL), and meniscus injury residuals.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative.  Id.  In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  In a statement dated February 14, 2025, the Veteran indicated he wished to withdraw this appeal in full.  His representative also included a letter confirming the withdrawal.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
