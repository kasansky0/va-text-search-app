DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his bilateral tinnitus symptoms began during his active service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from July 1995 to July 1999. 

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

In a March 2024 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for tinnitus. The Veteran submitted a request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) in April 2024. In an August 2024 rating decision, the AOJ determined that a duty to assist error had been identified during the HLR process for tinnitus. In a separate August 2024 rating decision, the AOJ confirmed and continued the previous denial of service connection for tinnitus. The Veteran submitted a timely VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement in September and, in so doing, requested direct review by the Board. 

Based on the Veteran's choice to pursue a direct review of his appeal, the Board will decide the appeal "based on the evidence of record at the time of the prior decision." Accordingly, no additionally submitted evidence may be considered. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. As such, the Board may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board observes that in the second August 2024 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been received to reopen the Veteran's previously denied claim and readjudicated the Veteran's claim for service connection for tinnitus. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Accordingly, a discussion as to whether new and relevant evidence has been received sufficient to readjudicate the claim is not required herein.

Finally, the Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, No. 21-7363 (U.S. Vet. App. June 21, 2024). The Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). Here, while more than 60 days following the receipt of the September 2024 VA 10182 have passed, the one-year period following the August 2024 rating decision has not passed. However, as this decision represents a full grant of the benefits sought, the Board will proceed with adjudication as there is no prejudice to the Veteran.

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

Service connection is granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303. Service connection requires competent evidence of: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) inservice incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Under?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(b), service connection will be presumed where there are either chronic symptoms shown in service or continuity of symptomatology since service for diseases identified as "chronic" in?38?C.F.R. § 3.309(a).?Walker v. Shinseki,?718 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.

To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must persuasively stand against a finding that the evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Tinnitus is a type of disorder associated with symptoms that are uniquely capable of lay observation. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). The primary role of the Board in adjudicating a tinnitus claim is to assess the credibility of the Veteran's statements. Buchanan v. Nicholson,?451 F.3d 1331?(Fed. Cir. 2006). 

The Veteran contends that he has tinnitus due to his military service when he was exposed to hazardous noise from live fire. He reported that his tinnitus onset in 1999 during live fire and has continued and only become louder and more frequent since onset. See December 2023 and February 2024 VA Examinations. The Veteran's DD 214 indicates that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was that of a cavalry scout. 

The Board finds the Veteran's reports credible and consistent with his service and his exposure to acoustic trauma during service is conceded. As such, the in-service element of his claim for service connection for tinnitus is met.

The Veteran's statements as to the onset, and continuity, of his tinnitus are credible, and his statements alone are sufficient to establish the criteria for service connection for tinnitus. In reaching this conclusion, the Board acknowledges that the December 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not due to his service. While the examiner recorded the Veteran's reports of tinnitus beginning in service and noted that the Veteran's MOS had a high probability for hazardous noise exposure, the examiner indicated that there was no evidence of a noise notch or shift in hearing during service and that this suggests it is less likely than not that his tinnitus is caused by or a result of his military noise exposure. However, the examiner did not consider the Veteran's contentions regarding his military noise exposure in providing an opinion. Additionally, while another VA examination was obtained in February 2024 which confirms a diagnosis of tinnitus and includes the Veteran's consistent reports of tinnitus beginning in service, the February 2024 examiner did not provide an opinion and instead referred to the December 2023 opinion. 

The probative value of the December 2023 VA examination opinion is undermined by the Veteran's statements. Tinnitus symptoms are uniquely capable of lay observation. In the current appeal, the Veteran's statements as to when he experienced the onset of tinnitus symptoms are clearly more probative than the opinion of a medical examiner attempting to determine speculatively what the Veteran would have personally experienced years ago. The probative evidence supports this claim. Accordingly, service connection for bilateral tinnitus is granted.
