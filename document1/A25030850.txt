ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that a current TBI began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a TBI are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army from March 1994 to March 2019.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the January 2024 rating decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Veteran elected the Board's Direct Review docket. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. This restricts the Board's review to the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 rating decisions. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that evidence was associated with the claims file after the January 2024 rating decisions on appeal, which was during a period of time that is outside the applicable evidentiary window. Therefore, the Board has not considered that evidence in its present decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300(a). If the Veteran would like VA to consider the additional evidence that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and identify the evidence for the AOJ's consideration. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

However, as the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is being remanded, the AOJ will consider the claim in light of the entire claims file upon remand.

Service Connection

Entitlement to service connection for a TBI is denied.

The Veteran contends that he has current residuals of an in-service TBI. See August 2023 VA 21-526EZ. Specifically the Veteran contends that he has a TBI residuals from a mild concussion sustained while stationed in Germany. See id. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In the January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a TBI, which was based on the September 2023 VA initial evaluation of residuals of TBI examination. However, the Board notes in the September 2023 VA initial evaluation of residuals of TBI examination, the examiner reported that the Veteran had a resolved acute TBI. See also December 2023 Initial Evaluation of Residuals of TBI examination. Nevertheless, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c), "[a]ny finding favorable to the claimant made by either a VA adjudicator . . . or by the Board of Veterans' Appeals . . . is binding on all subsequent agency of original jurisdiction and Board of Veterans' Appeals adjudicators, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding." Accordingly, the Board is bound by this favorable finding of a current diagnosis of TBI. 

Additionally, in the January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ found that the Veteran suffered an in-service head injury. See January 2000 Service Treatment Record. Accordingly, the Board is bound by this favorable finding of an in-service occurrence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

However, the Board concludes that, while the Veteran has been found to have a current diagnosis of a TBI, and evidence shows that an in-service head injury occurred, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's current diagnosis of a TBI began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

Prior to January 2000, the Veteran's service treatment records are silent for reported head injuries. See January 1994 report of medical examination and report of medical history.  

A January 2000 service treatment record reflects that the Veteran sought treatment for a head injury with a laceration sustained while playing with his son in his house. The Veteran reported that although he felt he was going to black out, he did not. 

The February 2013, November 2018, and December 2018 service treatment records reflect negative screenings for TBIs. 

A January 2020 VA treatment record reflects a negative screening for a TBI. 

The Veteran reported a history of head injury in the March 2005 and September 2018 reports of medical history. The April 2005 and September 2018 reports of medical examination note no neurological or psychiatric abnormalities.  

Further, the Veteran underwent VA initial evaluation of residuals of TBI examinations in September and December 2023. 

The September 2023 VA examiner opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of TBI due to event in service, including a reported in-service head injury. The rationale was that although the Veteran reports having loss of consciousness for a few seconds after fall in 1999 and had sutures placed to his head at the time, "the medical records are otherwise negative for ongoing sequelae from this event." The examiner noted that Veteran endorses symptoms that are consistent with his behavioral health diagnosis, and he did not endorse headaches upon examination. Further, the examiner noted that the "Veteran was able to serve another 20 years without any event or incident or complaints from this event." Therefore, "[b]ased on time that has passed in relation to event this has likely resolved."

Further the December 2023 VA examiner opined that the finding of a current TBI diagnosis is less likely than not caused by toxic exposure risk activities, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The examiner reasoned that the 

Veteran sustained a head injury due to trauma when he hit his head on a door frame on 1/16/00. He had an AOC, documented as no LOC. Documented he felt fine by the next day. STR's have only a couple of mentions of headaches since then and he denied headaches on his separation exam . . . . This injury is not associated with TERA or ILER and Veteran denies any brain injury being related to exposures. He has mental health diagnosis that account for his subjective account of memory loss and irritability. 

Taken together, the September and December 2023 VA examination and opinions of record establish that the Veteran's found current diagnosis of a TBI is less likely than not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, including the in-service January 2020 head injury. The examiners' combined opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). Consequently, the Board finds the September and December 2023 VA initial evaluations of residuals of TBI examinations and opinions both probative and persuasive. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304-05. 

Although the Veteran believes the found current diagnosis of a TBI is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, the Veteran in this case is not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding this issue. The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that the Veteran has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the September and December 2023 VA initial evaluations of residuals of TBI examinations and opinions. 

Accordingly, the Board is persuaded that the evidence is against the Veteran's claim of service connection for a TBI. See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82. Thus, the appeal in this matter must be denied.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

In the January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made a favorable finding that new and relevant evidence had been submitted. Accordingly, the Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Unfortunately, the Board finds that remand is required to rectify a duty-to-assist error that occurred prior to the January 2024 rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

The Veteran contends that he has a current diagnosis of tinnitus that is due to hazardous noise exposure in service. See August 2023 VA 21-526EZ. 

The Board notes that the September 2022 and November 2023 VA tinnitus examinations, the examining audiologists have offered differing opinions as to whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of recurrent tinnitus. While the Board notes that tinnitus is a disability for which a lay person may offer a competent diagnosis, audiologists have medical expertise in the anatomy and disease processes of the ear. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002). But see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1).  Accordingly, an opinion as to whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of recurrent tinnitus from an audiologist should be afforded significant probative weight. However, in the absence of an addendum opinion that addresses the September 2022 and November 2023 VA tinnitus opinions, as well as the lay evidence of record, as to whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of recurrent tinnitus, the Board is left to rely on its own lay opinion, which it is forbidden from doing. See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991) (holding that the Board may only consider independent medical evidence and may not substitute its own medical opinion.)." Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the AOJ committed a duty-to-assist error prior to the January 2024 rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Remand for an addendum opinion to clarify whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus is required. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician to clarify the diagnosis of the Veteran's claimed tinnitus. The examiner should review the claims file, including, but not limited to, this remand, the March 2019, March 2021, April 2021, September 2022, and November 2023 VA tinnitus examinations and opinions; service treatment records; and the August 2023 VA 21-526EZ. The examiner should note the extent of his or her review within the claims file. 

This remand does not require an additional physical examination of the Veteran, unless the examiner finds that an additional examination is necessary to provide the requested opinion. 

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following: 

Does the Veteran have a current diagnosis of tinnitus?
