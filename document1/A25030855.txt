DOCKET NO. 250314-517968
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an initial 50 percent rating for headaches is granted, subject to controlling regulations governing the payment of monetary awards.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the entire appeal period, the Veteran's migraine headache symptoms have caused very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for an initial 50 percent, the maximum schedular rating, for migraine headaches, throughout the entire appeal period, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.32, 4.1, 4.2, 4.10, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1979 to November 1982.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

By way of background, in a December 2022 rating decision, the RO granted the Veteran's service connection claim for headaches, assigning a 30 percent rating, effective January11, 2021. 

In a December 2023 Decision Review Requests: Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996), the Veteran elected to appeal the December 2022 rating decision via the Higher-Level Review Lane in accordance with the AMA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601.

In April 2024, after Higher-Level Review, the RO denied the claim on appeal.

In a March 2025 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182), the Veteran timely appealed the April 2024 decision to the Board and elected the direct review docket. 

The Board also notes that the evidentiary record in a higher-level review is limited to the evidence of record as of the date the agency of original jurisdiction issued notice of the prior decision under review and the higher-level adjudicator may not consider additional evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601(f). Accordingly, the Board will review the evidence of record as of the date of the December 2022 rating decision. 

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c). 

Entitlement to a higher initial rating

Disability ratings are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § Part 4. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Where there is a question as to which of two disability ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § § 4.3.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. Where the Veteran is appealing the initial assignment of a disability rating, the severity of the disability is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the disability rating to the present time. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

The Veteran's headaches are currently rated under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100 pertaining to migraine headaches. Under this Diagnostic Code, a 30 percent disability rating is assigned for migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months. A 50 percent rating is assigned for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. Each of the criteria must be met in order to establish entitlement to the specified rating. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018) (the criteria of DC 8100 are successive and 38 C.F.R. § 4.7 is not for application).

The Board observes that the rating criteria do not define prostrating. Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary defines prostration as extreme exhaustion or powerlessness. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32nd ed. 2012). In Stedman's Medical Dictionary 1461 (27th Ed. 2000), prostration is defined as a marked loss of strength, as in exhaustion. In addition, in Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018), the Court defined "prostrating" as "lacking in vitality or will: powerless to rise: laid low" (citing Webster's Third New International Dictionary of The English Language Unabridged 1822 (1966)). See also Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 67, 70 (2020) (noting that the Court in Johnson defined "prostrating" as "'lacking in vitality or will: powerless to rise: laid low").

Similarly, the rating criteria also do not define severe economic inadaptability. However, the Court has indicated that, while there need not be a showing of unemployability, at a minimum, there should be an indication that the headaches are capable of interfering with the ability to earn money from work. Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440 (2004).

Turning to the pertinent evidence of record, in August 2022, a private disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) was provided by Dr. E., a private physician. He noted diagnosed migraine headaches, which produces approximately three to four prostrating headaches per month. Symptoms included sound sensitivity, blurred vision, and dizziness. The Veteran reported that his headaches last one to two days in duration, and require him to lay down for several hours at a time. Dr. E. stated that the Veteran has very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability. 

A November 2022 VA examination report noted diagnosed migraine headaches. The Veteran experienced pain on both sides of his head, which worsens with physical activity. Symptoms included sound sensitivity, blurred vision, and dizziness. The typical duration of his headaches were one to two days. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's headaches resulted in prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain once every month, but did not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability. Regarding functional impact of his condition on his ability to work, the examiner remarked that the Veteran has "difficulty in concentrating and completing tasks during episodes of migraine, has to avoid loud noises." 

In a March 2025 attorney brief, the Veteran's attorney argued that the November 2022 VA examiner noted that the Veteran did not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability, which contradicts Dr. E.'s report that the Veteran's symptoms caused very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability. Notably, the VA examiner acknowledged that the headaches created difficulty in concentrating and completing tasks, and pain increased upon physical exertion. 

Upon review, the Board finds that entitlement to a 50 percent initial rating is warranted. On the one hand, Dr. E.'s August 2022 DBQ reflected that the Veteran's headaches resulted in very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability. On the other hand, the November 2022 VA examination report that posited that the Veteran's headaches did not result in very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability. Thus, the evidence is in relative equipoise regarding whether the Veteran's headaches resulted in very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability. 

Thus, resolving evidence in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to a 50 percent initial rating is warranted. This is the maximum rating for headaches.
