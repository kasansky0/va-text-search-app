ORDER

The appeal of the issue of entitlement to a waiver of overpayment in the amount of $33,348.98 due to an overpayment of spousal dependency benefits having been rendered moot by the grant of such waiver, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a May 2024 decision, the Committee on Waivers and Compromises (Committee) granted a waiver of an overpayment of benefits in the amount of $33,343.98.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There remains no matter in controversy for which the Board has jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (a), 7105 (d) (5).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1968 to April 1971.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 administrative decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Committee.

The issue of entitlement to a waiver of overpayment in the amount of $33,343.98 due to an overpayment of spousal dependency benefits

In a May 2024 decision, the Committee granted a waiver of an overpayment of benefits in the amount of $33,348.98. This represents a complete grant of the Veteran's appeal and rendered moot any argument with regard to this matter.

Because the Veteran's claim for a waiver of overpayment has been rendered moot by virtue of the Committee's allowance in full, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Therefore, the current appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (a), 7105 (d) (5).
