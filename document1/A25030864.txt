ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran's tinnitus onset during active military service.

2. The medical evidence of record does not demonstrate a right ear hearing loss disability, as defined by VA regulations.

3. Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran's left ear hearing loss is due to active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

2. The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.385. 

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1997 to March 1998. The Veteran also had service in the Air Force Reserve from February 1997 to February 2004 including periods of active duty for training service (ACDUTRA).

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Competent medical evidence is evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions. Competent medical evidence may include statements conveying sound medical principles found in medical treatises. Competent medical evidence may include statements contained in authoritative writings, such as medical and scientific articles and research reports or analyses. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1).

Competent lay evidence is any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). This may include some medical matters, such as describing symptoms or relating a contemporaneous medical diagnosis. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Determinations as to service connection will be based on a review of all the evidence of record, to include all pertinent medical and lay evidence, with due consideration to VA's policy to administer the law under a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with the facts in each individual case. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

In determining whether service connection is warranted, the Board shall consider the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus, which he contends is related to exposure to acoustic trauma during his active service. Specifically, he argues that his tinnitus began during his active service and has been present ever since.

VA has established certain rules and presumptions for chronic diseases, including other organic diseases of the nervous system such as tinnitus. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015). With chronic diseases shown as such in service to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless attributable to intercurrent causes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). In addition, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, chronic diseases are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board concludes that the evidence of record supports the claim of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

In the November 2023, the AOJ made favorable findings that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus (as noted on the November 2023 VA examination); and the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise during service, as his military occupational specialty (MOS) of medical service apprentice has a low probability of noise exposure during service. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A. The Board notes the Veteran competently reported that his MOS included flight missions and moving equipment and patients on and around C-130 aircrafts. As such, the Board finds the first and second Shedden elements are met.

Therefore, the only remaining question is whether a nexus exists between the Veteran's tinnitus and in-service noise exposure.

The Board acknowledges that service treatment records (STRs) reflect no complaints or findings of tinnitus.

In a January 2011 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran reported he had tinnitus since his military service, and noted he had a constant ringing in his ears since service.

In a September 2011 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran reported he had tinnitus from being around military planes. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2011, and an addendum opinion in March 2012. The examiner provided a diagnosis of tinnitus, and provided a negative nexus opinion. In the March 2012 addendum opinion, the examiner opined, "careful review of the C-file reveals audiometric tests at enlistment and at intervals for hearing conservation purposes. The DD-214 shows enlistment date in May 1997. The enlistment audiogram in June 1997 shows normal hearing bilaterally. There are no significant threshold shifts evident when the enlistment audiogram is compared to hearing conservation tests of September 200, September 2001, and August 2008. The Veteran's hearing is within normal limits per the C&P audiological examination in November 2011. According to the Duty MOS Noise Exposure Listing from the DOD there is a low probability of hazardous noise related to the Veteran's MOS of Medical Service. The Veteran may recall that he noticed tinnitus in 2003 during military service, and though he indicates he may have hearing loss, there is no evidence to support a subjective report of hearing loss. Therefore, there is neither supporting evidence the tinnitus is due to acoustic trauma. It may be related to another medical condition such as anxiety. Therefore, it is not at least as likely as not the Veteran's hearing loss and tinnitus are due to military noise exposure."

The Board finds the November 2011 examination and March 2012 addendum opinion are afforded low probative value, as the opinion improperly relied on the absence of in-service treatment records, did not consider the lay testimony of the Veteran, and was otherwise conclusory. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).

The Veteran submitted a private opinion in support of his claim by Dr. D. Pong, dated November 2022. Dr. Pong opined, "one cannot say exactly how long this condition existed prior to the date of diagnosis or definitively state its cause. However, it is as likely as not that the Veteran's exposure to hazardous noise, flight missions and moving equipment and patients on and around C-130 aircrafts while working as USAF medical services apprentice contributes to or causes his current hearing loss and tinnitus conditions." The Board finds the November 2022 private opinion to be probative, as it was rendered by a trained professionals and based on the Veteran's medical history, lay statements, as well as an accurate factual understanding of the nature of his service. The Board observes that expert examiners are not required to comment on every piece of evidence in a claim file. See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 105 (2012) ((citing Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 293 (2012)). Additionally, experts are also presumed to be aware of up-to-date medical knowledge and current medical studies, and there is no requirement to explicitly cite any studies or sources of information which may be favorable or unfavorable to any particular theory. See Monzingo, 26 Vet. App at 106-107.

In a November 2022 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran claimed his tinnitus was due to his exposure to hazardous noise while serving as a USAF medical services apprentice, and his job included flight missions, moving equipment and patients on and around C-130 aircrafts.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination and medical opinion in April 2023. The examiner provided a diagnosis of tinnitus, and provided a negative nexus opinion. The examiner opined the Veteran's tinnitus was at least as likely as not a symptom associated with his hearing loss, and less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The examiner opined, "service treatment records indicate no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds greater than normal measurement variability during service, evidence of no permanent auditory damage on active duty. There is no complaint of tinnitus in service treatment records. Onset of tinnitus is reported by the Veteran to be after separation from active-duty service, in 2001. Though excessive noise exposure on active duty is conceded and tinnitus is reported today, there is no nexus of auditory damage on active duty to relate current report of tinnitus to military noise."

The Board finds the April 2023 opinion is afforded low probative value as the VA examiner relied on the absence of treatment records during and after service. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (an examination must consider lay evidence of in-service incurrence or continuity of symptomatology since service). The VA examiner also failed to address the Veteran's contentions in providing an examination and opinion. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) (an adequate and thorough examination must consider all other relevant evidence of record, including lay statements).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination and medical opinion in November 2023. The examiner provided a diagnosis of tinnitus, and provided a negative nexus opinion. The examiner opined the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The examiner opined, "records indicate a low probability of hazardous noise exposure during service (MOS of medical service). Records lack evidence of tinnitus or threshold shifts during service. There is no report of tinnitus in service treatment records, at separation or in the medical records until the time of the claim. Records lack objective evidence to indicate that current tinnitus is related to service. Therefore, it is less likely than not that current tinnitus resulted from military-related noise exposure."

The Board finds the November 2023 opinion is afforded low probative value as the VA examiner relied on the absence of treatment records during and after service. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (an examination must consider lay evidence of in-service incurrence or continuity of symptomatology since service).

App. 295, 301 (2008) (an adequate and thorough examination must consider all other relevant evidence of record, including lay statements).

In view of the multiple attempts to secure an adequate VA examination, the Board finds that further attempts would be futile.

The Board finds the Veteran competently and credibly reported symptoms of tinnitus that began in active service and continued since. Such lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology. Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469-70; Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's credible lay statements establish the continuity and duration of his symptoms to be sufficient to establish entitlement to service connection in this instance. As such, the Board finds the third Shedden element has been met. In light of the foregoing, and after resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that his tinnitus had its onset during his service. Therefore, the Board resolves all doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that service connection for tinnitus warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Right and Left Ear Hearing Loss

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran asserts his hearing loss is due to active service.

At the November 2011 VA audiological examination for compensation purposes, the Veteran complained of impaired hearing. On the authorized audiological evaluation, the Veteran exhibited pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

	HERTZ

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg.

RIGHT	10	5	15	10	10

LEFT	10	15	10	15	12

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 98 percent in the right ear and of 94 percent in the left ear. The Veteran had normal hearing.

At the April 2023 VA audiological examination for compensation purposes, the Veteran complained of impaired hearing. On the authorized audiological evaluation, the Veteran exhibited pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

	HERTZ

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg.

RIGHT	10	15	25	20	18

LEFT	15	15	25	20	19

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 100 percent in the right ear and of 100 percent in the left ear. The Veteran had left ear sensorineural hearing loss at a level that is not considered to be a disability for VA purposes.

At the November 2023 VA audiological examination for compensation purposes, the Veteran complained of impaired hearing. On the authorized audiological evaluation, the Veteran exhibited pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

	HERTZ

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg.

RIGHT	15	25	20	20	20

LEFT	20	40	25	30	28.75

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 100 percent in the right ear and of 100 percent in the left ear. The Veteran had left ear sensorineural hearing loss at a level that is a disability for VA purposes.

The Veteran was afforded a private audiogram in July 2023, which found the Veteran had normal hearing in his right ear and "normal hearing 250-3000HZ sloping to mild SNHL" in the left ear.

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss.

As discussed below, the Board finds the Veteran does not have right hearing loss, as defined by VA regulations.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that is related to service.

Based on the above, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have right ear hearing loss as contemplated by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). VA audiometric testing has not reflected auditory thresholds of 40 decibels or greater, or auditory thresholds for at least three of the relevant frequencies of 26 decibels or greater, or Maryland CNC speech recognition scores of less than 94 percent. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Board has considered the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision in Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), which held that symptoms alone, without any underlying pathology, may rise to the level of a current disability if they result in a functional impairment of earning capacity. However, where VA has limited compensation to disabilities that conform to particular regulatory requirements, Saunders is not for application. C.f. Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393 (2020) (holding that the Saunders definition of a disability is constrained and that the Court lacks the jurisdiction to review the Secretary's specific determination of what constitutes a disability in the Rating Schedule).

In reaching this determination, the Board does not question the sincerity of the Veteran's reports of difficulty hearing and acknowledges that, as a lay person, he is competent to report that he has difficulty hearing. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The Board does find the Veteran credible as to his commentary regarding in-service noise exposure and current trouble hearing. Unfortunately, as a layperson, the Veteran does not have the requisite expertise to provide a competent opinion as to whether he has current right ear hearing loss disability in accordance with VA standards, as such matters require medical expertise. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1) (competent medical evidence means evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions). Specifically, the results of an audiogram administered by a state-licensed audiologist is the only type of evidence deemed competent to show a hearing impairment for VA purposes. Here, the audiogram results show no such impairment of right ear hearing loss.

In sum, absent any current diagnosis of a right ear hearing loss disability in accordance with VA standards, an award of service connection for right ear hearing loss is not warranted. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990). As there is no disability due to disease, injury, or event in active service, service connection for right ear hearing loss is not applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss.

Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board concludes that the evidence of record supports the claim of entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss.

In the November 2023, the AOJ made favorable findings that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of left ear mild sensorineural hearing loss; and the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise during service, as his military occupational specialty (MOS) of medical service apprentice has a low probability of noise exposure during service. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A. The Board notes the Veteran competently reported that his MOS included flight missions and moving equipment and patients on and around C-130 aircrafts. As such, the first and second Shedden elements are met.

Therefore, the only remaining question is whether a nexus exists between the Veteran's left ear hearing loss and in-service noise exposure.

The Board acknowledges that STRs reflect no complaints or findings of left ear hearing loss.

In a January 2011 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran reported he had problems with hearing loss since his military service due to exposure to planes and equipment.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2011, and an addendum opinion in March 2012. The Veteran had normal hearing at the November 2011 examination. In the March 2012 addendum opinion, the examiner provided a negative nexus opinion and opined, "careful review of the C-file reveals audiometric tests at enlistment and at intervals for hearing conservation purposes. The DD-214 shows enlistment date in May 1997. The enlistment audiogram in June 1997 shows normal hearing bilaterally. There are no significant threshold shifts evident when the enlistment audiogram is compared to hearing conservation tests of September 200, September 2001, and August 2008. The Veteran's hearing is within normal limits per the C&P audiological examination in November 2011. According to the Duty MOS Noise Exposure Listing from the DOD there is a low probability of hazardous noise related to the Veteran's MOS of Medical Service. The Veteran may recall that he noticed tinnitus in 2003 during military service, and though he indicates he may have hearing loss, there is no evidence to support a subjective report of hearing loss....Therefore, it is not at least as likely as not the Veteran's hearing loss and tinnitus are due to military noise exposure."

The Board finds the November 2011 examination and March 2012 addendum opinion are afforded low probative value, as the opinion improperly relied on the absence of in-service treatment records, did not consider the lay testimony of the Veteran, and was otherwise conclusory. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).

Additionally, experts are also presumed to be aware of up-to-date medical knowledge and current medical studies, and there is no requirement to explicitly cite any studies or sources of information which may be favorable or unfavorable to any particular theory.

In a November 2022 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran claimed his hearing loss was due to his exposure to hazardous noise while serving as a USAF medical services apprentice, and his job included flight missions, moving equipment and patients on and around C-130 aircrafts. The Board does find the Veteran credible as to his commentary regarding in-service noise exposure and current trouble hearing. Unfortunately, as a layperson, the Veteran does not have the requisite expertise to provide a competent opinion as to whether he has a current hearing loss disability in accordance with VA standards, as such matters require medical expertise. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1) (competent medical evidence means evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination and medical opinion in April 2023. The examiner provided a negative nexus opinion and opined that the Veteran's hearing was within normal limits for both ears on examination, therefore it is less likely as not that any hearing loss is due to military noise exposure or acoustic trauma. The Board finds this opinion highly probative as the examination adequately tested the Veteran's hearing to determine whether a diagnosis of hearing loss for VA purposes was present at that time. However, the Board notes the Veteran now has a current disability of left ear hearing loss.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination and medical opinion in November 2023. The examiner provided a negative nexus opinion and opined, "records indicate a low probability of hazardous noise exposure during service (MOS of medical service). Records lack evidence of hearing loss or positive threshold shifts during service. Unilateral sensorineural hearing loss is also not highly correlated with noise induced hearing loss. Therefore, it is less likely than not that the hearing loss resulted from military-related noise exposure." 

The Board affords the November 2023 opinion low probative value. The VA examiner failed to address the Veteran's contentions in providing an examination and opinion. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) (an adequate and thorough examination must consider all other relevant evidence of record, including lay statements). The examiner also provided insufficient rationale, relying partially on the lack of a significant threshold shift when the proper inquiry is whether the Veteran's current hearing loss is related to the Veteran's conceded in-service noise exposure. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 164 (1993). The examiner also did not provide a rationale on why unilateral sensorineural hearing loss is not highly correlated with noise induced hearing loss or what the Veteran's unilateral hearing loss could be correlated with instead.

In view of the multiple attempts to secure an adequate VA examination, the Board finds that further attempts would be futile.

The Veteran has been diagnosed with left ear hearing loss for VA purposes and in-service noise exposure was conceded. In addition, the Veteran provided competent and credible lay statements regarding his military noise exposure on aircrafts and around equipment. Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds the overall evidence of record is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's diagnosed left ear hearing loss is the result of his military service and resulting noise exposure. As such, the Board finds the third Shedden element has been met. Therefore, the Board resolves all doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that service connection for left ear hearing loss is warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
