REMANDED

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for asthma is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the United States Army from May 2010 to June 2011. 

In September 2019, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) continued its 30 percent evaluation of asthma. 

In the September 23, 2019, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on October 9, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2019 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for an increased rating for asthma, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for asthma is remanded.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board has the duty to remand issues when necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error. Pub. L. No. 115-55 section (2)(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

The Board finds remand is warranted to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error that occurred prior to the decision on appeal. Specifically, the Board finds that the VA examiner in the June 2019 examination failed to provide the Veteran a contemporaneous pulmonary function testing (PFT) to determine the severity of his service connected asthma condition. 

In October 2018, VA conducted a PFT for the Veteran. The test results showed a 71% predicted for FEV1 and a 74% predicted for Post-Test FEV1. Also, the examination contains a pre-test 75% predicted for FVC and a post-test 73% predicted for FVC. Moreover, the VA examiner noted a pre-test 95% predicted for FEV1/FVC and a post-test 101% predicted for FEV1/FVC.

In October 2018, the Veteran underwent a respiratory conditions VA examination. The VA examiner noted a diagnosis for asthma. The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran does not require the use of oral or parenteral corticosteroid medications. However, the VA examiner mentioned that the Veteran required the use of inhaled medications. Specifically, the Veteran used intermittent inhalational bronchodilator therapy. Moreover, the VA examiner remarked that the Veteran did not require the use of oral bronchodilators, the use of antibiotics, or outpatient oxygen therapy. In addition, the VA examiner highlighted that the Veteran did not have any physician visits for required care of exacerbations. 

The VA noted that a pulmonary function testing was performed on October 9, 2018. These were the results from the October 2018 test for pre-bronchodilator: 75% predicted for FVC; 71% predicted for FEV-1; and 76.9% predicted for FEV-1/FVC. The VA examiner stated that the FEV-1/FVC test result most accurately reflects the Veteran's level of disability.

In connection to the Veteran's May 2019 fully developed claim for increased rating for asthma, in June 2019, he underwent a respiratory conditions VA examination. The VA examiner noted a diagnosis for asthma. The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran does not require the use of oral or parenteral corticosteroid medications. However, the VA examiner mentioned that the Veteran required the use of inhaled medications. Specifically, the Veteran used daily inhalational bronchodilator therapy. Moreover, the VA examiner remarked that the Veteran did not require the use of oral bronchodilators, the use of antibiotics, or outpatient oxygen therapy. In addition, the VA examiner highlighted that the Veteran had less than monthly physician visits for required care of exacerbations. 

The VA noted that a pulmonary function testing was performed on October 9, 2018. These were the results from the October 2018 test for pre-bronchodilator: 75% predicted for FVC; 71% predicted for FEV-1; and 96% predicted for FEV-1/FVC. The VA examiner stated that the FEV-1/FVC test result most accurately reflects the Veteran's level of disability.

Upon review of the before-mentioned examinations, the Board finds that remand is warranted. It is clear from the evidence that the October 2018 VA examination and the June 2019 VA examination used the same PFT results. This was acknowledged by the VA examiner in the June 2019 examination. The Board believes that a pre-decisional duty to assist error was committed by not conducting a PFT evaluation during the June 2019 VA examination, which was the examination in connection with the present claim. A review of the medical evidence and the Veteran's statements show that between the October 2018 and June 2019 VA examinations, there was a possible worsening of the condition that was not properly examined by VA. The VA examiner even indicated in the June 2019 examination that the Veteran had a physician visit because of an exacerbation that was not noted in the October 2018 VA examination. Also, the Veteran's intake of inhalational bronchodilator therapy went from intermittent in October 2018 to daily in June 2019. Furthermore, this is consistent with the Veteran's testimony in the October 2024 Board hearing in which he attested having visited the emergency room in 2018 or 2019 in relation to his asthma condition. 

A remand is necessary to ascertain the current severity of his service connected asthma condition and conduct a contemporaneous PFT evaluation.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a new examination to determine the current severity of his asthma. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria. 

The examination must be conducted by an examiner of appropriate expertise. The examiner must review the entire claims file and must note that review in the report. All necessary tests and studies should be accomplished, and all clinical findings reported in detail.

A complete rationale must be provided for any opinion expressed and if an opinion cannot be provided without resort to speculation, the reason for speculation must be explained.
