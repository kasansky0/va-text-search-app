REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2004 to December 2010. 

In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of September 2021, January 2022, and September 2022 rating decisions.  In November 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2021 decision regarding the effective date of service connection for asthma; at the time of the prior January 2022 decision regarding the effective dates of the ratings assigned for PTSD and GERD; and at the time of the September 2022 decision regarding service connection for bilateral hearing loss and erectile dysfunction.  

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in November 2022 and October 2023. Specifically, the November 2022 rating decision is a result of the September 2022 higher level review request. The October 2023 rating decision regarding service connection for sleep apnea was issued as a result of a special review of the Veteran's file which was mandated on November 15, 2022.  

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Regarding the claim for service connection for sleep apnea, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal regarding service connection for sleep apnea cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Regarding the claim related to an earlier effective date for service connection for sleep apnea, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2021 decision; for the claims related to earlier effective dates for the increased ratings of GERD and PTSD, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of January 2022 decision; and for the service connection claims for erectile dysfunction and bilateral hearing loss, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the pertinent claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).?Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. Id.; see also Caluza v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction.

The Veteran contends that he has erectile dysfunction and that such is due to service. 

The first element of service connection requires a current disability. Such can be fulfilled by a diagnosis of record related to the Veteran's claim or symptoms that cause functional impairment. Here, a careful review of the record does not reveal any diagnosis. Notably, in his September 2021 Fully Developed Claim, the Veteran indicated that he has received treatment for the claimed disability at the VA since 2009. A review of VA treatment records did not reveal any diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, or any complaints related to symptoms of such. Indeed, the records reflect "no history of erectile dysfunction" specifically on more than one occasion. 

Moreover, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not reflect, and the Veteran does not contend that he experienced any symptoms or diagnosis related to his claim during service. Further, over the course of the Veteran's claim, he has not contended with any level of specificity how his claimed condition is related to service. The Board has considered whether the filing of the claim and this appeal is sufficient to find that there is a current diagnosis; as noted, however, the Veteran has not provided any specifics regarding this disability or its contended relationship to service. The Veteran's reports would be competent - if provided. After careful review of the record, however, to include the record that indicates that he has not reported this disability to medical providers nor provided details about the experienced symptoms, the Board finds that there is not a current disability.

The Board notes that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination regarding his claim. However, the Board finds that there is no current disability or signs and symptoms of a current disability, which is required by McLendon. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006). Moreover, there is no in-service event sufficient to trigger VA's duty to assist in obtaining this medical nexus opinion even under the low threshold of McLendon. Id. As noted above, the Veteran's STRs show no treatment or record of erectile dysfunction. The Veteran has not otherwise identified or submitted any evidence before the AOJ at the time of the rating decision on appeal to demonstrate his entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction. Generalized lay allegations, such as the Veteran's general claim of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction merely by listing such on his application for compensation are insufficient to meet the McLendon standards. See Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1276 (2010). 

Accordingly, the claim for erectile dysfunction must be denied because a current disability is always required in order to establish service connection. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992). As the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application and service connection for erectile dysfunction is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran contends he has hearing loss and that such is due to noise exposure in service. The AOJ found that the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise in service. The Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings under the AMA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38?C.F.R. §?3.385. 

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not reflect any diagnoses related to hearing loss. Notably, upon audiometric testing in July 2004, the Veteran's STRs reflect that his right ear auditory thresholds were 5, 5, 5, 10, and 10 decibels, respectively; and the left ear auditory thresholds were 5, 10, 5, 5, and 15 decibels, respectively. Upon audiometric testing in April 2008, the Veteran's STRs reflect that his right ear auditory thresholds were 5, 5, 0, 0, and 5 decibels, respectively; and the left ear auditory thresholds were 0, 0, -5, -10, and 0 decibels, respectively. Upon audiometric testing in November 2010, the Veteran's STRs reflect that his right ear auditory thresholds were 5, 0, 0, 5, and 10 decibels, respectively; and the left ear auditory thresholds were 0, 0, -5, 0, and 10 decibels, respectively. 

Upon VA audiometric testing in July 2021 the Veteran's right ear auditory thresholds were 10, 15, 15, 15, and 25 decibels, respectively; and the left ear thresholds were 15, 15, 15, 15, and 15 decibels, respectively. The Veteran's speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test were 100 percent in each ear.

VA audiometric testing performed during the September 2021 examination also reflected that the Veteran does not have a hearing loss disability for VA purposes. The Veteran's test reflected right ear thresholds of 20, 20, 15, 25, and 15, respectively and 15, 15, 10, 15, and 25, respectively in the left ear. The Veteran's speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test were 98 percent for the right ear and 96 percent for the left ear.  

Upon VA examination in July 2022, the Veteran's right ear thresholds were 10, 10, 5, 20, and 15, respectively and 10, 10, 5, 15, and 25, respectively in the left ear. The Veteran's speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test were 100 percent for each ear.  

In each of the VA examinations of record, the VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's hearing is normal. Moreover, the Board finds that none of the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 or 4000 Hertz reflect an auditory threshold of 40 decibels or greater; none of the thresholds is 26 decibels or greater; and the Veteran's speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are at least 96 percent in each ear. Therefore, the Veteran's current claimed hearing loss is not considered a disability by VA. The VA examiners noted in each examination that the testing is valid and that the use of speech discrimination score is appropriate for this Veteran. Moreover, no contrary, competent evidence establishing hearing loss has been presented or identified.

While the Veteran is competent to observe and report his symptoms, he is not competent to diagnose such condition. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a bilateral hearing loss disability as defined by VA regulations. Moreover, while the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran experienced hazardous noise in service, the claim for bilateral hearing loss must be denied because a current disability is always required in order to establish service connection. Brammer, 3 Vet. App. 223. As the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application and service connection for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

Effective Dates 

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r), the effective date based on a reopened claim is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. As of March 24, 2015, VA no longer recognizes informal claims. 

The law pertaining to the effective date of a VA claim for increase in disability mandates that, unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date for the increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The pertinent statute specifically provides that the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if any application is received within one year from such date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). If the increase became ascertainable more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the claim, then the proper effective date would be the date of claim. In a case where the increase became ascertainable after the filing of the claim, then the effective date would be the date of increase. See generally Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 5, 2021, for the award of service connection for asthma.

The Veteran contends that he has continuously pursued his claim for service connection for asthma from July 13, 2021. 

The procedural history is paramount to this claim. VA did receive a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim from the Veteran on July 13, 2021, however, such listed hearing loss, hair loss, and GERD. Specifically, the July 2021 claim did not list asthma. On August 11, 2021, VA received another VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim which did list "asthma." Accordingly, the Board finds that August 11, 2021, is the date of claim for asthma. In the November 2022 rating decision, the AOJ explained that service connection was granted from August 5, 2021, in accordance with a change in the law which provided service connection for asthma based on service in Iraq.

Here, as the effective date of August 5, 2021, is before the date of claim, the Board will not disturb the AOJ's favorable grant to the Veteran. However, the Board finds that an effective date prior to August 5, 2021, is not warranted. As the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application and the claim for an earlier effective date is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 27, 2021, for the award of a 70 percent rating for PTSD. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date of August 5, 2020, for the evaluation of PTSD as 70 percent disabling. 

By way of background, the Veteran was awarded service connection for PTSD, rated as 50 percent disabling, effective December 11, 2010. On August 6, 2020, VA issued correspondence acknowledging receipt of the Veteran's Intent to File on August 5, 2020. On August 12, 2020, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for an increased rating for PTSD, in part. In October 2020, the Veteran appeared for a VA examination in association for his claim for increased rating for PTSD. In October 2020, the AOJ issued a rating decision continuing the 50 percent evaluation of PTSD. In June and July 2021, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review of the October 2020 decision regarding the evaluation of PTSD. In August 2021, the AOJ issued a decision continuing the 50 percent rating for PTSD. On September 27, 2021, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application requesting review of the PTSD evaluation. In November 2021, the Veteran appeared for a VA examination in association for his claim for increased rating for PTSD. In January 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision awarding an increase to 70 percent for PTSD, effective September 27, 2021; the decision explains that such increase was primarily based on the November 2021 VA examination.  In September 2022, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review regarding the effective date of the PTSD rating granted in January 2022. In November 2022, the AOJ issued the higher-level review rating decision on appeal which denied an earlier effective date for the increased rating for PTSD. In October 2023, the Veteran appealed such denial to the Board. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board agrees with the Veteran that he has continuously pursued his claim since his August 2020 claim. However, the effective date of a VA claim for increase in disability mandates that, unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date for the increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but not earlier than the date of receipt of the application for such. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Accordingly, the proper effective date is the later date between the date of claim or the date the facts support such increase. Here, the November 2021 VA examination supports such increase. 

The Veteran's PTSD is rated under DC 9411, which provides that such disability is evaluated pursuant to the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (General Rating Formula). 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. The General Rating Formula, in pertinent part, provides a 50 percent rating when there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

A 70 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

A 100 percent rating is warranted when there is total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of closest relatives, own occupation, or own name.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 is "symptom-driven," meaning that "symptomatology should be the fact-finder's primary focus when deciding entitlement to a given disability rating" under that regulation. See Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 116-17 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The symptoms listed are not exhaustive, but rather "serve as examples of the type and degree of symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating." Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). In the context of determining whether a higher disability evaluation is warranted, the analysis requires considering "not only the presence of certain symptoms, but also that those symptoms have caused occupational and social impairment in most of the referenced areas" - i.e., "the regulation...requires an ultimate factual conclusion as to the Veteran's level of impairment in most areas." Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 117-18; 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.

Further, when evaluating a mental disorder, the Board must consider the "frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission," and must also "assign an evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination." 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(a).

Upon VA examination in October 2020, the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology included depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; chronic sleep impairment; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. The Veteran exhibited orientation, appropriate eye contact, and liner, logical, and goal-directed thought processes. The examiner indicated there was no evidence of hallucinations, delusions, or thought disorders and no difficulty with concentration. The examiner noted that the Veteran's long and short-term memories were intact and that his judgment and insight appeared fair. The Veteran denied suicidal and homicidal ideation. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's psychiatric condition caused occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

Upon VA examination in November 2021, the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology included depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks more than once a week; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting name, directions, or recent events; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships; and obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities. The examiner indicated that the Veteran was alert, fully oriented, pleasant, cooperative, had a depressed mood, had logical speech, and normal attention and concentration. The examiner reported that the Veteran denied hallucinations and delusions and demonstrated maintained eye contact. The Veteran denied suicidal and homicidal ideation. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's psychiatric condition caused occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

Moreover, a review of VA treatment records since August 2020 did not reveal any additional psychiatric symptoms. Accordingly, as the Veteran's symptoms did not demonstrate occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas until after the September 2021 claim date, September 27, 2021, is the proper effective date. 

As stated above, if the increase became ascertainable more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the claim, then the proper effective date would be the date of claim. Therefore, the ultimate question in determining the effective date for the 70 percent rating is when it was factually ascertainable that such demonstrated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

The Board notes that in September 2016 the AOJ issued a rating decision continuing the Veteran's 50 percent rating for PTSD. Later that month, the Veteran was advised of the decision and of his appellate rights, but he did not enter a timely notice of disagreement with such decision. Additionally, no new and material evidence was physically or constructively associated with the record within one year of the issuance of such decision, and no relevant service department records have since been received. Therefore, the September 2016 rating decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 20.302, 20.1103.  As such is more than one year before the date of claim, September 27, 2021, is the proper effective date and the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date must be denied. 

As the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application and the claim for an earlier effective date is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

5. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 13, 2021, for the award of a 60 percent rating for GERD with irritable bowel syndrome. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date of August 5, 2020, for the award of a 60 percent rating for GERD with irritable bowel syndrome. 

By way of background, the Veteran was awarded service connection for irritable bowel syndrome, rated as noncompensably disabling, effective December 11, 2010. On August 6, 2020, VA issued correspondence acknowledging receipt of the Veteran's Intent to File on August 5, 2020. On August 12, 2020, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for an increased rating for irritable bowel syndrome, in part. In support of such, the Veteran submitted private treatment records and appeared for a VA examination in September 2020. In October 2020, the AOJ issued a rating decision increasing the Veteran's evaluation for irritable bowel syndrome to 30 percent, effective August 5, 2020. On May 10, 2021, the Veteran submitted a claim for sleep apnea and stated that his GERD and irritable bowel syndrome cause major sleep complications. 

On July 13, 2021, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for GERD. Later that month, the Veteran appeared for a VA examination related to such claim. In August 2021, the AOJ issued a decision granting an increased rating of 60 percent for GERD with irritable bowel syndrome (hereafter "GERD"), effective July 13, 2021. 

On September 27, 2021, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application requesting review of the effective date of the increased GERD evaluation. In November 2021, the Veteran appeared for a VA examination in association with his GERD claim.  In January 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision continuing the 60 percent rating for GERD, denying the claim for an earlier effective date for such. In March 2022, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application requesting review of the effective date of the increased GERD evaluation in the January 2022 rating decision. In September 2022, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review requesting review of the effective date of the increased GERD evaluation in the January 2022 rating decision. In November 2022, the AOJ issued the HLR rating decision on appeal which denied an earlier effective date for the increased rating for GERD. In October 2023, the Veteran appealed such denial to the Board. 

From December 2010 to August 4, 2020, the Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome was rated as noncompensably disabling under DC 7319. From August 5, 2020, to July 12, 2021, the Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome was rated as 30 percent disabling under DC 7319. From July 13, 2021, the Veteran's GERD with irritable bowel syndrome has been rated under DC 7319-7346. A hyphenated DC used in this case indicates that a digestive disorder under DC 7319 is the service-connected disorder, and DC 7346 identifies the basis for the evaluation assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Because there is no DC specifically for GERD during the period on appeal, it is rated by analogy to hiatal hernia, under DC 7346.

Pursuant to DC 7319, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate disability, with frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress. A 30 percent rating is warranted for severe disability, with diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea and constipation, with more or less constant abdominal distress. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114. 

DC 7346 provides a 10 percent disability rating for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation, but at less severity. A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. The maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346. The Board notes that DC 7346 was amended as of May 2024 but as the period on appeal is prior to such amendment, the changes and amended criteria will not be discussed. 

Turning to the relevant medical evidence, the Veteran submitted private treatment records dated August 2020 which reflect generalized abdominal pain and abdominal bloating. The Veteran reported dull moderately severe intermittent abdominal pain that is relieved by bowel movements. 

Upon VA examination in September 2020 for intestinal conditions, the Veteran reported constipation with pain. The examiner indicated that the Veteran has alternating diarrhea and constipation, frequent episodes of bowel disturbances with abdominal distress. 

Upon VA examination in July 2021 for esophageal conditions, the examiner noted the Veteran's GERD diagnosis is from 2018, the Veteran reported that his symptoms began in 2008. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's GERD causes symptoms combination productive of severe impairment of health, persistently recurrent epigastric distress, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, sleep disturbance caused by esophageal reflux, nausea, and vomiting. 

Given this factual background, in order to warrant an earlier effective date, it must be factually ascertainable that the Veteran's service-connected disability increased in severity so as to warrant a rating of 60 percent within the one-year period prior to receipt of his claim. As previously indicated, there is no evidence of worsening in the one year prior to the July 2021 claim date to support a 60 percent rating. Specifically, VA treatment records reflect complaints of epigastric pain and acid reflux in 2018, and the July 2021 VA examination contains the Veteran's report of onset of symptoms from 2008 and indicated a diagnosis date of 2018 for GERD. As the increase is ascertainable more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the claim, the proper effective date is the date of claim. Accordingly, July 13, 2021, is the proper effective date for the 60 percent rating for GERD with irritable bowel syndrome. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that entitlement to a rating of 60 percent did not arise until the July 2021 VA examination which followed the July 13, 2021, claim. Accordingly, such is the proper effective date and the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date is denied. As the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application and the claim for an earlier effective date is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.

In a March 2022 written statement, the Veteran asserted that he believes his sleep apnea is due to his service-connected conditions causing weight gain resulting in his obesity leading to the development or aggravation of his sleep apnea. Specifically, the Veteran explained that his service-connected migraines prevent outside activities; his service-connected asthma causes him to struggle to exercise; his service-connected irritable bowel syndrome limits the foods he can eat; and his back and knees prevent him from being active. The Veteran explained that he copes with his with psychiatric disability by drinking alcohol and eating unhealthy food which help his mind to escape the pain and sadness. He explained that the medications for his service-connected conditions cause constipation, abdominal/stomach cramping, tiredness, dizziness, and headaches which increase his weight gain and make exercising difficult. 

In July 2022, VA obtained a medical opinion regarding whether the Veteran's sleep apnea is due to each of his service-connected disabilities. Such opinion does not address the Veteran's March 2022 statements as it merely states that each of the service-connected conditions "does not represent an established primary etiology of sleep apnea in the medical literature" and that the "condition also does not represent an established primary etiology of weight gain/obesity." The examiner does not consider the specifics of the Veteran's circumstance to provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities cause his obesity and, in turn, cause or aggravate sleep apnea. Moreover, the examiner's opinion does not address the medical journal article regarding the specific relationship between PTSD and sleep apnea. Accordingly, the July 2022 VA examiner's opinions are inadequate. 

In June 2023, VA obtained opinions as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea is due to each of the following service-connected conditions: asthma, lumbar spondylosis with degenerative arthritis and IVDS, PTSD with alcohol use disorder, migraine headaches, right knee iliotibial band syndrome, telogen effluvium alopecia areata, right lower extremity radiculopathy, and GERD with irritable bowel syndrome. Each of these opinions address whether sleep apnea is due to the condition, rather than considering the Veteran's statements that such conditions caused his obesity which caused or aggravated his sleep apnea. Notably, in each of these opinions, the VA examiner included hyperlinks to content that is not otherwise part of the record on appeal. That content was not accessed nor considered as part of the record before the Board. See Bowey v. West, 11 Vet. App. 106, 108-09 (1998) (holding that the mere reference to non-VA documents is insufficient to incorporate them into the record). While the Board could review evidence submitted via hyperlink, because hyperlinked information may not be static, the Board would be unable to determine whether what the Board saw when it accessed the hyperlinked information was what the Veteran intended to submit as evidence, or what the examiner intended to rely on.  As the Board cannot create evidence, what was found at the hyperlinked address would not be part of the record.  In turn, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) would be unable to perform meaningful appellate review of evidence that is not in the record.  Given the foregoing, the Board advises that hyperlinked references were not reviewed.

Accordingly, the Board finds the failure to properly develop the Veteran's assertion that his service-connected disabilities caused or aggravated his obesity, which then caused or aggravated his sleep apnea, is a pre-decisional duty to assist error. In this regard, the Board notes that obesity may act as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service-connected on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. However, in order to show secondary service connection is warranted under such a theory, a veteran must show (1) that his service-connected disability caused or aggravated his obesity and, if so, (2) whether the obesity as a result of the service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing or aggravating his claimed condition, and (3) whether the claimed condition would not have occurred or worsened but for obesity caused by the service-connected disability. Id.; Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020). Therefore, a remand is necessary in order to obtain addendum opinions addressing such matter.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Forward the record, to include a copy of this Remand, to an appropriate clinician other than the clinician who provided the July 2022 and June 2023 opinions for an addendum opinion addressing the etiology of the Veteran's sleep apnea. 

After a review of the record, the clinician should address the following inquiries:

(a.) Is it approximately at least as likely as not that the Veteran's sleep apnea is due to his PTSD? In offering such opinion, the examiner should consider and address general medical literature addressing the relationship between PTSD and sleep apnea submitted by the Veteran in March 2022.

(b.) Is it approximately at least as likely as not that the Veteran's sleep apnea is aggravated by his PTSD? In offering such opinion, the examiner should consider and address general medical literature addressing the relationship between PTSD and sleep apnea submitted by the Veteran in March 2022.

(c.) If the above opinions are unfavorable, please opine: (1) is it approximately at least as likely as not that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD, back disability, knee disability, asthma, GERD with irritable bowel syndrome, and/or migraine, to include medications taken for such disabilities, caused or aggravated his obesity and, if so, (2) whether such resulting obesity was a substantial factor in causing or aggravating his sleep apnea and (3) whether his sleep apnea would not have occurred or worsened but for the obesity caused by such service-connected disability.

In coming to an opinion, the examiner should consider and discuss the Veteran's March 2022 written statement regarding the effect of his service-connected disabilities on his diet and exercise.
