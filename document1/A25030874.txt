ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of May 26, 2017, for the grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU), is granted subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 22, 2020, for the grant of a 50 percent rating for migraine/tension headaches (hereinafter migraine headaches) is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date of October 13, 2016, for the grant of a 70 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was unable to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities as of May 26, 2017.  

2. Prior to April 22, 2020, the Veteran did not have migraine headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

3. The Veteran is in receipt of a 70 percent rating for PTSD effective October 13, 2016.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of May 26, 2017, for entitlement to TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400, 4.16.

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to April 22, 2020, for the assignment of a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107(b), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.124a Diagnostic Code 8100.

3. There remains no allegation of specific error of fact or law regarding the effective date of October 13, 2016, regarding the 70 percent rating for PTSD.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.101, 20.200, 20.201, 20.202. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran's active service included a period of honorable service from July 8, 2005, to February 25, 2008.  He also had a period of active duty for training from October 2002 to April 2003.  

The appeal arises from a Higher-Level Review rating decision dated in April 2022; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

By way of history in an April 2021 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted TDIU effective April 22, 2020, continued the 70 percent rating for PTSD, and granted a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches, effective April 22, 2020.  On March 31, 2022, the Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review claim regarding these determinations.  In reviewing a Higher-Level Review rating decision, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the underlying rating decision for which the Veteran requested the Higher-Level Review (as that is the evidence that the AOJ was permitted to consider in the Higher-Level Review decision on appeal), which in the instant case is the April 2021 rating decision.  In May 2022 a notice of disagreement was received from the Veteran whereby he selected both the Direct Review and Hearing Review lanes.  Subsequently in July 2022 the Veteran confirmed his selection of the Direct Review lane. 

As the Veteran in the July 2022 notice of disagreement selected the Direct Review lane, the Board many only consider evidence as of the April 2021 rating decision.  If evidence was added to the record during an ineligible period identified above, the Board has not considered that evidence.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.

Earlier Effective Date Criteria

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  The amendments also, inter alia, eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014), codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155.  The amended regulations apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i), the effective date for a grant of direct service connection will be the day following separation from active service, if a claim is received within one year after separation from service.  Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.

The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the application is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a),(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o); Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 12-98.

A claim for a TDIU is a type of increased rating claim. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 32-34 (2007).  In Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that a claim for TDIU is part of an increased rating claim when such claim is expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record.

A claimant may submit an intent to file a claim, and VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form.  If VA then receives a complete application form within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b).

Continuous pursuit of a claim or an issue can be achieved by timely and properly filing an appropriate review option, i.e., a supplemental claim, a Higher-Level review request, or notice of disagreement to the Board appeal generally within one year of the rating decision.   38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500 (c).  If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, as opposed to the date the most recent request for review was received.  However, where VA receives the supplemental claim application after expiration of the one-year period, continuous pursuit of the claim will be broken.   38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500 (c) & (e)(2), 3.400.

For supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issued notice of a decision, or the Board of Veterans' Appeals issued notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h)(2).

Issue 1: Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 26, 2018, for the grant of TDIU.

Total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body that is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340.

Total disability ratings are authorized for any disability or combination of disabilities for which the Schedule for Rating Disabilities prescribes a 100 percent disability evaluation, or, with less disability, if certain criteria are met.  Id.  Where the schedular rating is less than total, a total disability rating for compensation purposes may be assigned when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, or if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).  Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, or one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, and disabilities resulting from a common etiology or a single accident or disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric, will be considered as one disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).  If not, all veterans who are shown to be unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disability shall be rated totally disabled.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  If 4.16(a) is not met, the case will be referred to the Director of the Compensation Service, for extraschedular consideration of all veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities.  Id.  

As further provided by 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a), "marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment."  For purposes of TDIU, marginal employment generally shall be deemed to exist when a veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person.  Marginal employment may also be held to exist, on a fact found basis (includes but is not limited to employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop), when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold.  Consideration shall be given in all claims to the nature of the employment and the reason for termination.  Id.   

The economic component of "unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation," means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the US Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a); Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 72-73 (2019).  The non-economic component involves consideration of the veteran's history, education, skill, and training as well as whether he/she has the physical and mental ability to perform the type of activities required for that occupation.  Id; Pederson v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 276, 286-287 (2015).  

The central inquiry is "whether [a] veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability."  Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).  Consideration may be given to a veteran's education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his or her age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).  The sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough.  A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment, but the ultimate question is whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment.  Van Hoose.  

The applicable regulations place responsibility for the ultimate TDIU determination on VA, not a medical examiner.  Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  TDIU is to be awarded based on the judgment of the rating agency.  Floore v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 376, 381 (2013).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the claimant is afforded the benefit of the doubt.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

The Veteran is service-connected for the following disorders: PTSD rated 50 percent from February 26, 2014, and 70 percent from October 13, 2016; migraine/tension headaches rated 30 percent from May 26, 2018, and 50 percent from April 22, 2020; status post left index finger injury rated zero percent effective February 26, 2014; erectile dysfunction (ED) rated zero percent from October 27, 2017; residual scars of folliculitis rated zero percent from April 5, 2018; and pseudofolliculitis barbe rated zero percent from February 26, 2014, 10 percent from April 5, 2018, 30 percent from June 8, 2018, and zero percent from July 1, 2020.  He had a combined rating of 50 percent effective February 26, 2014; a combined rating of 70 percent from October 13, 2016; a combined 80 percent rating from May 26, 2018; and a combined 90 percent rating from June 8, 2018.  The Veteran met the schedular criteria for TDIU as of October 13, 2016.  

The pertinent facts are as follows.  On October 13, 2016, the Veteran's TDIU claim was received on VA Form 21-8940, whereby he contended that he was unable to work due to his PTSD.  In a January 2017 rating decision, with a notice letter dated on January 20, 2017, the AOJ denied entitlement to TDIU.  In a May 2017 notice of disagreement, the Veteran only disagreed with the 50 percent continued rating for PTSD in the January 2017 rating decision.  On May 30, 2018, the Veteran filed a TDIU claim on VA Form 21-8940, which was denied in a January 2019 rating decision with a notice letter dated on January 31, 2019.  On April 25, 2019, the Veteran filed a TDIU claim on VA For 21-8940, which was denied in a September 2019 rating decision.  The Veteran was provided with notice of the September 2019 rating decision; however, he did not appeal the decision.  On April 22, 2020, the Veteran's intent to file a claim was received.  On March 15, 2021, the Veteran file a TDIU claim on VA Form 21-8940, whereby he contended that was unable to work due to PTSD and migraine headaches.  In the rating decision dated on April 20, 2021, the Veteran's TDIU claim was granted effective, April 22, 2020, and in March 2022 he filed his Higher-Level Review claim.  In the April 2022 rating decision currently on appeal, the AOJ noted that a rating decision on November 19, 2019, with notification letter on November 20, 2019, granted service connection for migraine headaches, effective May 26, 2018, the date the Veteran's intent to file a claim for headaches was received.  The AOJ found that as the Veteran's intent to file the TDIU claim was received on April 22, 2020, was within one year of the November 2019 rating decision that granted service connection for migraine headaches, it can be considered part of the same claim stream as the migraine headaches issue, stemming from the May 26, 2018, intent to file. 

The remaining question is whether it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran was entitled to TDIU one year prior to May 26, 2018, the date the Veteran' intent to file a claim was received.  VA treatment records in July 2017 show that the Veteran has not worked as a driver for a month and half, had difficulty focusing but would like to study music production.  The Veteran was unable to start school due to his inability to focus.  A Rehabilitation Needs Inventory dated August 2017 shows that the Veteran worked part-time as a driver but could not work full time in part due to PTSD.  VA treatment records in July 2017 show that the Veteran was unemployed.  VA treatment records in August 2017 show that he the Veteran did not work for a while but was planning to work the following weekend as a driver.  He was seeking vocational rehabilitation and was interested in audio technology film and acting.  VA treatment records in November 2017 show that the Veteran was working for Uber and was planning to start school the following year to be a safety manager/building inspector.  In a June 2018 letter a VA psychiatrist opined that the Veteran's PTSD significantly impacted his ability to maintain steady and consistent paid employment as evidence by extended periods of unemployment.  The Veteran's income tax return for 2017 shows that his wages were $5,892.00.  The weighted average poverty threshold for one person in 2017 was $12,488.  See https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html.

The Board recognizes that in May 2022, the Veteran contended that he was entitled to an earlier effective date of October 13, 2016, and in the notice of disagreement received in July 2022, he clarified that he was entitled to an earlier effective date for TDIU.  Although the Veteran met the schedular criteria for TDIU as of October 13, 2016, in a January 2017 rating decision, with a notice letter dated on January 20, 2017, the AOJ denied entitlement to TDIU and the Veteran did not appeal this determination and on May 30, 2018, the Veteran filed a new TDIU claim on VA Form 21-8940.  Based on the totality of the evidence discussed above, the Board finds the criteria for an effective date of May 26, 2017, but not earlier, for entitlement to TDIU have been met.  

Issue 2: Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 22, 2020, for the grant of a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches.

In the notice of disagreement received in July 2022, the Veteran contended that he was entitled to an earlier effective date of October 13, 2016, for the 50 percent rating for his migraine headaches.  

Under Diagnostic Code 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for less frequent migraine attacks.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months. Finally, a maximum 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

Characteristic is defined as a trait, quality, or property or a group of them distinguishing an individual, group, or type.  See Webster's Third New International Dictionary of The English Language Unabridged 376 (1966).  Prostrating means lacking in vitality or will: powerless to rise: laid low.  Id.  Because Diagnostic Code 8100 specifically governs migraine headaches, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" plainly describes migraine attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality.  See Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018).

The terms "productive of severe economic adaptability" have not been clearly defined by regulations or case law.  The Court has noted that "productive of" can either have the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing."  Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445 (2004).  Migraines need not actually "produce" severe economic inadaptability to warrant the 50 percent rating.  Id. at 445-46.  "Economic inadaptability" does not mean unemployability, as such would undermine the purpose of regulations pertaining to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability.  Id. at 446; 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  At a minimum, however, migraines must be capable of producing "severe" economic inadaptability.  

The rating criteria under Diagnostic Code 8100 are successive, meaning that to satisfy the criteria for a higher level, a claimant must satisfy all the requirements of the lower levels, and 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 and 4.21 do not apply to circumvent these requirements.  See Johnson.

The pertinent facts are as follows.  On October 13, 2013, the Veteran's claim for headaches was received, which was denied in a February 2015 rating decision with a notice letter dated on February 24, 2015.  On October 27, 2017, the Veteran filed a claim to reopen service connection for headaches on VA Form 21-526EZ, which was denied in a December 2017 rating decision with a notice letter dated on December 5, 2017.  The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement with this determination in December 2017, a Statement of the Case under the Legacy system was issued in March 2018, and a Form 9 Appeal under the Legacy System was received in April 2018.  On May 26, 2018, the Veteran's intent to file a claim was received and on May 30, 2018, on VA Form 21-526EZ the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for headaches due to PTSD.  On October 26, 2018, the Veteran opted into the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) and selected the Supplemental Claim.  In a February 2019 RAMP decision, the AOJ determined that new and relevant evidence was received and continued to deny service connection for headaches based on the determination that the headaches were not due to service.  On April 25, 2019, the Veteran filed a claim for headaches as secondary to PTSD, however in May 2019 VA sent him a letter advising that he file the claim on a proper form.  On May 24, 2019, the Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review claim on VA Form 20-0996 regarding denial of the headaches claim and a July 2019 rating decision found a duty to assist error during the Higher-Level of Review for headaches.  In a November 2019 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for migraine/tension headaches and assigned a 30 percent rating effective May 26, 2018.  The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement with the effective date in December 2019, which he was advised in December 2019 could not be accepted as it was not filed on the proper VA Form 10182.  A proper notice of disagreement was not received within one year of the November 2019 rating decision nor was a supplemental claim.  On April 22, 2020, the Veteran's intent to file a claim was received and on March 15, 2021, the Veteran filed a TDIU claim on VA Form 21-8940, whereby he contended that he was unable to work due to PTSD and migraine headaches.  Thus, the Veteran's claim for migraine headaches arose from the March 2021 TDIU claim.  In the April 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches effective April 22, 2020, the date the Veteran's intent to file a claim was received for the TDIU claim.  

Thus, the date of the Veteran's claim for headaches currently before the Board is April 22, 2020.  As discussed above, the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the application is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a),(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o).  The evidence does not show that it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran was entitled to a 50 percent rating one year prior to April 22, 2020.  On VA examination in August 2019 the examiner determined that the Veteran did not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability and the competent contemporaneous evidence is consistent with this finding.  

Thus, the evidence is persuasively against the claim of entitlement to a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches prior to April 22, 2020, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  

Issue 3: Entitlement to an effective date of October 13, 2016, for the grant of a 70 percent rating for PTSD.

In a February 2019 rating decision, the AOJ granted a 70 percent rating for PTSD effective October 13, 2016.  In the appeal stream currently before the Board, the Veteran's PTSD claim arose from the TDIU claim received on March 15, 2021, whereby he contended in part that he could not work due to his PTSD.  In the April 2021 rating decision and the Higher-Level Review April 2022 rating decision the 70 percent rating for PTSD was continued.  In the July 2022 notice of disagreement, the Veteran contended that he was entitled to an earlier effective date of October 13, 2016, for the 70 percent rating for PTSD.  However, as discussed above the Veteran has been in receipt of a 70 percent rating for PTSD effective October 13, 2016.  

The Board may dismiss any case where there is no issue of fact for the Board to determine.  38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d).  It is a well-established judicial precedent that when there is no case or controversy, or when a once live case or controversy becomes moot, the Court lacks jurisdiction.  See Bond v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 376, 377 (1992).

?

Given that the Veteran is in receipt of the benefit he is seeking, there consequently remains no allegation of specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  Thus, the issue of entitlement to an effective date of October 13, 2016, for the 70 percent rating for PTSD is dismissed.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
