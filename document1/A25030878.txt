DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 1, 1996 for the award of service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for hearing loss in September 1996, which encompassed a claim for tinnitus that was not adjudicated until the July 2022 rating decision on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of December 1, 1996 for the award of service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1974 to November 1996. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review in November 2023. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than April 2, 2021 for the award of service connection for tinnitus. 

For service connection claims filed within one year after separation from service, the effective date is the day following separation from active service or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). Prior to March 24, 2015, a "claim" was defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. See Rodriguez v. West, 189 F. 3d. 1351 (Fed. Cir. 1999). An informal claim must have been written and identified the benefit being sought. See id.

Here, in September 1996, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for hearing loss. In the November 1996 VA examination, he reported longstanding hearing loss and tinnitus with concurrent onset in service. The examiner opined that his hearing loss and tinnitus were consistent with exposure to noise in service. The AOJ granted service connection for hearing loss only in a February 1998 rating decision and assigned December 1, 1996 as the effective date, the day after the Veteran separated from service. In April 2021, the Veteran filed an Intent to File. In March 2022, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his hearing loss. In July 2022, the AOJ awarded service connection for tinnitus based on the April 2022 VA examination findings and conclusion and assigned an effective date of April 2, 2021, based on the Intent to File.  

A "reasonably raised claim remains pending until there is either a recognition of the substance of the claim in an [AOJ] decision from which a claimant could deduce that the claim was adjudicated or an explicit adjudication of a subsequent 'claim' for the same disability." Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 243 (2007). In determining whether a filing raised a claim that was pending and unadjudicated at the time VA granted a subsequent "claim" for benefits for the same disability, VA must be mindful of its "duty to fully and sympathetically develop a...claim to its optimum" by "determin[ing] all potential claims raised by the evidence [and] applying all relevant laws and regulations." Moody v. Principi, 360 F.3d 1306, 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (internal quotation omitted). This duty includes broadly construing a claim "based on the reasonable expectations of the nonexpert, self-represented claimant and the evidence developed in processing that claim," including "the claimant's description of the claim[,] the symptoms the claimant describes[,] and the information the claimant submits or that the Secretary obtains in support of the claim." Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009).

Considering the evidence and governing case law, the Board finds that the Veteran's September 1996 hearing loss claim reasonably encompassed a claim for tinnitus. The Board further finds that his tinnitus claim remained unadjudicated until the July 2022 rating decision. Accordingly, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of December 1, 1996 for the award of service connection for tinnitus is granted.
