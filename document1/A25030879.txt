ORDER

For the increased rating period from January 5, 2023, a rating higher than 20 percent for the right (major) shoulder rotator cuff tear is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

For the increased rating period from January 5, 2023, the symptomatology and functional impairment of the right shoulder rotator cuff tear have not met or more nearly approximated limitation of motion of the (major) arm to midway between the side and shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

For the increased rating period from January 5, 2023, the criteria for a rating higher than 20 percent for the right (major) shoulder rotator cuff tear disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5201. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant, had active service from September 2003 to September 2007.

This matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision. 

By way of procedural history, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for the right shoulder rotator cuff tear (Diagnostic Code 5201) and glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis with dislocation, right shoulder (Diagnostic Code 5202), on January 5, 2023.  The March 2023 rating decision denied an increased rating for both disabilities, and an April 2023 Notice of Disagreement appealed only the right shoulder rotator cuff tear disability rating.  The rating period on appeal begins on the date of the increased rating claim.  

The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) or modernized review system, created a new framework of review for veterans who disagree with VA's decision on their claim.  In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Disability Rating Criteria

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

Where there is a question as to which of two disability ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  It is the defined and consistently applied policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case.  When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where an increase in an existing disability rating based on established entitlement to compensation is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  The relevant temporal focus for adjudicating an increased rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  Pyramiding, the rating of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when rating a veteran's service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  It is possible for a veteran to have separate and distinct manifestations from the same injury which would permit rating under several diagnostic codes; however, the critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the conditions is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition.  Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits compensating a veteran twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment).

When an unlisted condition is encountered, it will be permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous.  Conjectural analogies will be avoided, as will the use of analogous ratings for conditions of doubtful diagnosis, or for those not fully supported by clinical and laboratory findings.  Nor will ratings assigned to organic diseases and injuries be assigned by analogy to conditions of functional origin.  38 C.F.R. § 4.20.

When rating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 allows for consideration of functional loss due to pain and weakness causing additional disability beyond that reflected on range of motion measurements.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  Further, 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 provides that consideration also be given to decreased movement, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement, swelling, and deformity or atrophy of disuse.  Painful motion is considered limited motion at the point that pain actually sets in.  See VAOPGCPREC 9-98.

With any form of arthritis, painful motion is an important factor of disability, the facial expression, wincing, etc., on pressure or manipulation, should be carefully noted and definitely related to affected joints.  Muscle spasm will greatly assist the identification.  Sciatic neuritis is not uncommonly caused by arthritis of the spine. The intent of the schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability.  It is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  Crepitation either in the soft tissues such as the tendons or ligaments, or crepitation within the joint structures should be noted carefully as points of contact which are diseased.  Flexion elicits such manifestations.  The joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

Additionally, painful motion is an important factor of disability, and joints that are actually painful, unstable, or malaligned, due to healed injury, should be entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  Although pain may cause a functional loss, pain itself does not constitute functional loss. Pain must affect some aspect of "the normal working movements of the body" such as "excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance," in order to constitute functional loss.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).

Where a claimant has a full range of motion with pain, or a noncompensable limitation of motion that is accompanied by pain, a 10 percent rating may be appropriate.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011); see also Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 39.  Painful motion should be considered to determine whether a higher rating is warranted on such basis, whether or not arthritis is present.  See Burton, 25 Vet. App. at 5.

For the increased rating period from January 5, 2023, a rating higher than 20 percent for the right (major) shoulder rotator cuff tear is denied.

The service-connected right (major) shoulder disability is assigned a 20 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5201 for the rating period from January 5, 2023.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  The Veteran appeals for a rating in excess of 20 percent for the right shoulder rotator cuff tear. 

Under Diagnostic Code 5201, limitation of an arm at the shoulder level warrants a 20 percent rating whether it is the major or minor extremity.  When motion is limited to midway between the side and shoulder level, a 20 percent rating is warranted for the minor extremity and a 30 percent rating is warranted for the major extremity.  When shoulder motion is limited to 25 degrees from the side, a 30 percent rating is warranted for the minor extremity and a 40 percent rating is warranted for the major extremity.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  The Veteran is right hand dominant.  See January 2022 VA treatment records.

Normal ranges of shoulder flexion and abduction are from 0 to 180 degrees, and external and internal rotation are from 0 to 90 degrees.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate I.  In determining whether a veteran has limitation of motion to shoulder level, it is necessary to consider forward flexion and abduction.  See Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 314-316 (2003).

After a review of all the lay and medical evidence, the Board finds that, for the rating period on appeal from January 5, 2023, even with consideration of additional limitations of motion and function due to pain and during repetitive use, the persuasive weight of the evidence demonstrates that the right shoulder rotator cuff tear disability has not manifested limitation of motion of the (major) arm to midway between the side and shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees).

A VA examination was provided in January 2023 during which the Veteran reported constant right shoulder pain and intermittent dislocations, with functional loss of inability to lift of or pull anything heavy, inability to grab items for very long, and inability to reach overhead.  The Veteran denied flareups.  Initial range of motion testing revealed flexion to 90 degrees and abduction to 70 degrees in the right shoulder.  During repetitive use, the VA examiner estimated additional restriction with pain, fatigability, and lack of endurance as flexion of to 80 degrees and abduction to 60 degrees.  There was no muscle atrophy, crepitus, or ankylosis.  The examiner assessed current residuals of recurrent dislocation (subluxation) of the glenohumeral (scapulohumeral) joint for the right shoulder, including infrequent episodes and guarding of movement only at shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction at 90 degrees.  

The Board has considered whether a higher disability rating is warranted on the basis of additional functional loss due to pain or due to weakness, fatigability, incoordination, or pain on movement of a joint, or during flareups.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, and 4.59.  In this case, there is painful motion and limitation of motion with mild localized tenderness, pain, fatigability, and lack of endurance; however, as noted above, even considering any additional functional limitation due to tenderness, pain, fatigability, and lack of endurance, the right shoulder rotator cuff tear disability has not been manifested by limitation of motion approximating to midway between the side and shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees), as required for a higher (30 percent) rating for limitation of motion of the major extremity under Diagnostic Code 5201.

Additionally, the Board has considered whether any other diagnostic code would provide a higher rating for the right shoulder rotator cuff tear disability.  The lay and medical evidence shows no ankylosis of the scapulohumeral articulation, nor does the Veteran describe right shoulder limitations of motion as ankylosed or describe functional ankylosis; therefore, the Board finds that Diagnostic Code 5200 is inappropriate for rating the right shoulder disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; see also January 2023 VA examination report.

Diagnostic Code 5202 provides ratings based on impairment of the humerus.  The Veteran has a separate evaluation under Diagnostic Code 5202 for a glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis with dislocation, right shoulder, which is currently 20 percent disabling; however, the Veteran did not appeal this rating in the April 2023 Notice of Disagreement on appeal.  

Diagnostic Code 5203 provides ratings based on impairment of the clavicle or scapula.  The VA examiner assessed no evidence of malunion, nonunion, or dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint condition on examination.

As the lay and medical evidence shows no malunion, nonunion, or dislocation of the clavicle or scapula, or impairment of function of the contiguous joint, the Board finds that Diagnostic Code 5203 is not an appropriate code to rate the right shoulder disability.  In addition, a 10 percent rating is the maximum rating provided under Diagnostic Code 5003 for arthritis of one major joint (right shoulder).

For these reasons, the Board finds that the criteria for a rating in excess of 20 percent for the right shoulder rotator cuff tear disability have not been met at any time during the rating period from January 5, 2023.  As the persuasive weight of the evidence (more than relative equipoise) is against the assignment of a higher rating, the appeal for higher rating must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
