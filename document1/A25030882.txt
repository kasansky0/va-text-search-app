FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On January 31, 2019, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) received notice of intent to file a claim.

2. On March 21, 2019, the AOJ received a VA Form 21-8940 (Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability); the Veteran indicated that his claim for TDIU was based on his service-connected coronary artery disease.

3. A June 2019 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to TDIU.

4. On May 5, 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting review of the June 2019 rating decision as to the denial of the claim of entitlement to a TDIU.

5. On September 9, 2020, the AOJ received a VA Form 21-8940; the Veteran indicated that his claim for TDIU was based on his service-connected coronary artery disease and his service-connected PTSD.

6. An increased rating claim for PTSD was not reasonably raised by the record prior to May 5, 2020, when the Veteran maintained that he was unable to work due to his service-connected PTSD and coronary artery disease. 

7.  It was not factually ascertainable in the year prior to May 5, 2020 that the Veteran's PTSD increased in severity.

8. The earliest date that the Veteran is in receipt of a permanent total rating is January 31, 2019.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to May 5, 2020 for an award of an increased, 70 percent disability evaluation for PTSD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to January 31, 2019 for an award of entitlement to TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, 4.16.

3. The criteria for an effective date prior to January 31, 2019 for the award of DEA benefits have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.55, 3.400, 3.807(a), 21.3020, 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1969 to March 1972 and from April 2004 to June 2005.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  The rating decision in this case was issued after February 19, 2019; thus, the AMA framework applies.

In a February 25, 2021, rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) completed its review based on the evidence of record up to that date, and awarded the Veteran an increased, 50 percent disability evaluation for PTSD, as well as granted the Veteran's claim of entitlement to TDIU and awarded eligibility for DEA benefits; an effective date of September 9, 2020 was assigned for each award of benefits.  

On February 22, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 (Request for Higher Level Review), wherein the Veteran indicated that he disagreed with the effective dates assigned.  A March 15, 2022 Higher Level Review decision awarded the Veteran an increased, 70 percent disability evaluation for PTSD, effective May 5, 2020, as well as awarded the Veteran an earlier effective date of January 31, 2019 for the award of TDIU and an earlier effective date of January 31, 2019 for the award of DEA benefits.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on March 23, 2022.  

The Veteran then appealed that decision to the Board by filing filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal on March 13, 2023.  The Veteran requested Evidence Submission review by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), which permitted the Veteran 90 days to submit additional evidence in support of his claim from the date of the VA Form 10182.  On March 20, 2023, the Board acknowledged receipt of the Veteran's Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182).  

In a November 2023 decision, the Board denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of an increased, 70 percent disability evaluation for PTSD, as well as denied the Veteran's claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the awards of TDIU and DEA benefits.

Thereafter, the Veteran appealed the November 2023 Board decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In a November 2024 Joint Motion for Remand (JMR or Joint Motion), the Secretary of VA and the Veteran (the parties) requested that the Court vacate the November 2023 Board decision to the extent that it denied the Veteran's claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates.  A November 2024 Court Order granted the motion and remanded the claims for readjudication consistent with the terms of the Joint Motion.  

Duties to Notify and Assist

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Earlier Effective Date

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increased, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  

In assigning effective dates for increases, except as provided in paragraph § 3.400(o)(2) and § 3.401(b), the effective date is date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  As an exception to this general rule, § 3.400(o)(2) provides that the effective date is the earliest date of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of claim.  

The Court has held that 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) are applicable only where an increase in disability precedes a claim for an increased disability rating.  See Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997).  Thus, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of the case: (1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose); (2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable); or (3) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim).  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see also Harper v. Brown, supra. 

The Court has made it clear that the date of the filing of a claim is controlling in determinations as to effective dates.  A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  

Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by VA.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by VA, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

Under the modernized, AMA, system of review, an effective date can be preserved if a claim is continuously pursued.  For a claim to be continuously pursued, a supplemental claim must be filed within one year after a final decision or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  For continuously pursued claims, except as otherwise provided by other provisions of this part, including 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision, provided that any appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims must be accepted as timely by that court.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  

Except as otherwise provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision or the Board issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

In a recent decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) invalidated the part of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 that excluded supplemental claims from the intent-to-file framework; thus, if a supplemental claim is received within one year of an intent to file, the date the intent to file was received is the date of claim for effective date purposes. Military-Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

A pending claim is an application, formal or informal, which has not been finally adjudicated. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(c).  The pending claims doctrine provides that a claim remains pending in the adjudication process if VA fails to act on it.  Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 422 (1999).  Raising a pending claim theory in connection with a challenge to the effective-date decision is procedurally proper.  Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 249, 255 (2007).

Regarding the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statue or regulation.  However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. This is determined on a "facts found" basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober; 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). It is important to note that an effective date generally can be no earlier than the facts found.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011). For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 5, 2020 for the award of an increased, 70 percent disability evaluation for PTSD.

As previously discussed, the case is subject to a November 2024 Joint Motion.  The Joint Motion indicates that the Board erred when it failed to address explicitly raised arguments in accordance with Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552-56 (2008).  In this regard, the Joint Motion noted that the Veteran, in his March 2023 VA Form 10182, argued that he was entitled to a 70 percent disability evaluation prior to May 5, 2020 because a February 19, 2020 VA treatment record reflected that the Veteran reported that he retired in 2014 because he "could not deal with those people" and had issues with his temperament and aggravation.  The Joint Motion also noted that a January 2021 VA PTSD examination report "included an opinion that the Veteran's medical record suggested that he began to develop more PTSD symptoms at some point in March 2020."  The Joint Motion concluded that the Board's discussion of evidence concerning the Veteran's PTSD prior to May 5, 2020 failed to address the Veteran's March 2023 argument and the particulars of the medical evidence of record.

As noted above, essentially, the effective date for an increased disability rating is either the date entitlement arose or the date of receipt of claim, whichever is later, or, if entitlement arose within one year prior to the date of claim, then that date is the effective date.  

In this case, the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD in a July 2011 rating decision and assigned a 30 percent disability evaluation, effective August 6, 2010.  No appeal was taken from this decision, and no new and material evidence was received within one year.  Consequently, the August 6, 2010 claim was finally adjudicated and is not pending.  The Board also observes that, in a December 12, 2017 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to a disability evaluation in excess of 30 percent for his service-connected PTSD.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and no new and material evidence was received within one year of this decision.  Thus, it also became final.

With regard to the date the claim was received, the VA first received a communication from the Veteran evincing intent to apply for benefits on January 31, 2019.  VA received a completed VA Form 21-8940 (Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability) on March 21, 2019, wherein the Veteran claimed entitlement to TDIU solely due to his service-connected coronary artery disease.  

In a June 6, 2019 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to TDIU.  On May 5, 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim), indicating that he wanted the AOJ to review the June 6, 2019 decision denying the Veteran's claim of entitlement to TDIU.  On September 9, 2020, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 21-8940, wherein the Veteran claimed entitlement to TDIU due to his service-connected coronary artery disease and his service-connected PTSD.

In a February 25, 2021 rating decision, the AOJ awarded the Veteran an increased, 50 percent disability evaluation for his service-connected PTSD, effective September 9, 2020; TDIU and DEA benefits were also awarded, effective September 9, 2020.  

On February 22, 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, requesting review of the February 25, 2021 rating decision as to the effective date of the award of a 50 percent disability evaluation for PTSD, as well as effective dates of the awards of TDIU and DEA benefits.

As previously noted, in the March 15, 2022 Higher-Level Review rating decision on appeal, the AOJ, in pertinent part, awarded the Veteran an increased, 70 percent disability evaluation for his service-connected PTSD, effective May 5, 2020, as well as awarded the Veteran an earlier effective date of January 31, 2019 for the award of TDIU and an earlier effective date of January 31, 2019 for the award of DEA benefits.

In this case, the Board observes there was no indication that the Veteran intended to file a claim for an increased disability rating for his service-connected PTSD prior to his May 5, 2020 supplemental claim for TDIU.  The Board observes that the Veteran did not explicitly claim entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for PTSD; however, in his September 9, 2020 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran asserted that he was unable to secure and maintain employment due, in part, to his service-connected PTSD.  As such, the Veteran's claim for an increased disability evaluation for PTSD can reasonably be considered part and parcel of his May 5, 2020 TDIU claim.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  

Accordingly, the date of claim is May 5, 2020.  

For an increase in disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).  In order for entitlement to an increase in disability compensation to arise, the disability must have increased in severity to a degree warranting an increase in compensation.  See Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511, 519 (1992).  Thus, determining whether an effective date assigned for an increased rating is correct or proper under the law requires: (1) a determination of the date of the receipt of the claim and (2) a review of all the evidence of record to determine when an increase in disability was "ascertainable."  Hazan, 10 Vet. App. at 521.

Under the applicable rating provision, a 50 percent disability rating requires occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short-term and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9434. 

For a 70 percent evaluation to be warranted, there must be occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood due to symptoms such as:  suicidal ideation; obsessive rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  Id.

A 100 percent rating is provided for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: Gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.125 - 4.130.

The Board has reviewed the Veteran's VA treatment records and examination reports for the entire rating period on appeal (since May 5, 2020) and finds that the Veteran's increase in symptomatology of his PTSD was first demonstrated at his January 2021 VA examination, which was obtained following his May 2020 claim for TDIU.  The Board observes that the findings at the January 2021 VA examination demonstrate that the Veteran experiences anxiety, panic attacks, sleep impairment, disturbances of mood and motivation, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, and difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  His symptoms were described as productive of occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood.  The Board finds that based on the Veteran's submission of his May 5, 2020 claim for TDIU that the severity of symptoms present at the January 2021 examination were present in May 2020.  Accordingly, the Board finds that May 5, 2020 is the date entitlement arose as well as the date of claim.  A 70 percent disability evaluation accounts for the Veteran's social and occupational impairment as caused by these symptoms.

The Board notes that the Veteran and his representative assert that the Veteran met the criteria for a 70 percent disability evaluation for PTSD prior to his May 5, 2020 claim for TDIU.  To this point, the Board reiterates that the Joint Motion found that the Veteran, through his representative, in a statement submitted with the Veteran's March 2023 VA Form 10182, argued that the Veteran was entitled to an increased, 70 percent disability evaluation prior to May 5, 2020 because a February 19, 2020 VA treatment record indicated that the Veteran reported that he retired in 2014 because he "could not deal with those people" and had issues with his temperament and aggravation.  The Joint Motion also noted that the Veteran's representative asserted that a January 2021 VA PTSD examination report "included an opinion that the Veteran's medical record suggested that he began to develop more PTSD symptoms at some point in March 2020."  (see November 2024 Joint Motion).  Nevertheless, reviewing the Veteran's VA treatment records for the rating period during the one-year period prior to his May 5, 2020 claim for TDIU, the Board finds that there is no basis for finding that it was factually ascertainable that the Veteran's PTSD warranted a 70 percent rating prior to May 5, 2020.  In this regard, the Board finds that the available medical evidence fails to show that the Veteran received any mental health care in 2019.  In addition, to the extent that the Veteran relies on the February 2020 VA treatment record reflecting that the Veteran retired in 2014 due to his PTSD symptoms, 2014 is more than one year prior to the Veteran's May 5, 2020 claim.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (for an award of an effective date one year prior to the date of an increased rating claim, the claim must have been filed within one year of when the increase was factually ascertainable; if the claim was filed more than one year after that date, the provision for the one year earlier date does not apply). 

Moreover, with regard to the Veteran's assertion that the January 2021 VA examination report includes "an opinion" that the Veteran developed more PTSD symptoms "at some point in March 2020", the Board observes that the report actually reflects that the VA examiner, in a section titled "evidence comments" noted that "more symptoms began in 3/20."  Regardless, a review of the Veteran's March 2020 VA treatment records reflect that he sought mental health treatment due to an "adjustment disorder" related to a "Community Daily Living Problem."  In this regard, the Board observes that a March 17, 2020 VA treatment record indicates that the Veteran complained of chronic sleep issues, anxiety, and hypervigilance due to neighborhood noise and gunfire, and sought mental health counseling to work on these issues.  An April 2020 VA treatment record indicates that a mental status examination showed that the Veteran was alert and oriented, with normal psychomotor activity and an anxious mood; he denied hallucinations and delusions, his affect was appropriate, and his thought process was linear, logical, and goal directed.  The mental status examination note also stated that the Veteran's thought content and cognitive function were normal.  As such, the Board finds that there is no basis for finding that it was factually ascertainable that the Veteran's PTSD warranted a rating of 70 percent prior to May 5, 2020. 

Accordingly, May 5, 2020 is the proper effective date for the award of a 70 percent rating for his service-connected PTSD.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  The Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date is denied. 

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 31, 2019 for the award of TDIU.

The Board reiterates that the case is subject to a November 2024 Joint Motion.  In this regard, the Joint Motion indicates that the Board erred when it failed to include an analysis of the factors discussed in Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019) in its determination that the Veteran is not entitled to an TDIU effective date prior to January 31, 2019.  According to the Joint Motion, the Board discussed the lack of treatment records related to the Veteran's PTSD and symptoms of the Veteran's service-connected coronary artery disease, but did not provide the analysis required by Ray.  

The Board observes that the Veteran's representative, in a statement attached to the March 2022 VA Form 10182, argued that the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of January 31, 2018, one year prior to his claim for TDIU, because the Veteran qualified for TDIU on a schedular basis prior to January 2018.  The Veteran's representative noted that the Veteran retired as a mail courier in 2014 and indicated during a December 2017 VA PTSD examination that he enjoyed the work as a mail courier because he was able to work with minimal contact with other people.  The Veteran's representative acknowledged that his job as a mail courier was not impacted by the Veteran's service-connected PTSD, but that the Veteran's "heart disease, stamina, and strength are what would prevent him from employment today if he were a mail courier as he was for ten years prior to ending his job in 2014."

In finding the proper effective date, the Board must determine the date of claim and when entitlement arose.  With regard to the date the claim was received, the VA first received a communication from the Veteran evincing intent to apply for benefits on January 31, 2019.  VA received a completed VA Form 21-8940 (Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability) on March 21, 2019, wherein the Veteran claimed entitlement to TDIU due to his service-connected coronary artery disease.  The Board notes that the Veteran does not dispute that his claim for TDIU was received by VA on January 31, 2019.  The Board also finds that there was no communication from the Veteran evincing intent to apply for TDIU prior to January 31, 2019.  

As previously discussed, in a June 6, 2019 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to TDIU.  On May 5, 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim), indicating that he wanted the AOJ to review the June 6, 2019 decision denying the Veteran's claim of entitlement to TDIU.  On September 9, 2020, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 21-8940, wherein the Veteran claimed entitlement to TDIU due to his service-connected coronary artery disease and his service-connected PTSD.  

Thus, the proper date of claim for the Veteran's TDIU is January 31, 2019.  There is no application for TDIU prior to this date, nor is there any increased rating claim or appeal from an initial rating claim pending prior to this date upon which a claim for TDIU could be attached. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 454 (2009) (In these circumstances, the Court has determined that "[w]hen entitlement to TDIU is raised during the adjudicatory process of the underlying disability or during the administrative appeal of the initial rating assigned for that disability, it is part of the claim for benefits for the underlying disability.").

With regard to when entitlement arose, if entitlement arose within the year prior to the date of claim, then the effective date can be the date within that year that entitlement arose.  However, if it arose more than a year prior to or after the date of claim, then the date of claim is the proper effective date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Turning to the question of when entitlement to TDIU arose, TDIU may be granted only when it is established that the service-connected disabilities are so severe, standing alone, as to prevent the retaining or obtaining of substantially gainful employment.  If there is only one service-connected disability, it must be ratable at 60 percent or more to qualify for benefits based on individual unemployability.  If there are two or more such disabilities, there must be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). For purposes of this section, disabilities of both upper or lower extremities will be considered a single disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a)(1).

Veterans who, in light of their individual circumstances, but without regard to age, are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation as the result of service-connected disability shall be rated totally disabled, without regard to whether an average person would be rendered unemployable by the circumstances. Thus, the criteria include a subjective standard.  Unemployability is synonymous with inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. VAOPGCPREC 75-91; 57 Fed. Reg. 2,317 (1992). "Substantially gainful employment" is that employment "which is ordinarily followed by the nondisabled to earn their livelihood with earnings common to the particular occupation in the community where the veteran resides."  Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991).  "Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment."  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

In evaluating the Veteran's unemployability, the law states that in order to establish entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities, there must be impairment so severe that it is impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). Consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or to the impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19 (2015); Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).

In Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019), the Court clarified that substantially gainful employment contains economic and noneconomic components.  The Court explained that the economic component means "an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person," while the noneconomic component requires consideration of a veteran's ability to secure or follow that type of employment.  Id.  The Court further provided guidance as to the meaning of a veteran's ability to "secure and follow" such employment, noting that attention must be given to the veteran's occupational history, education, skill, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform occupational activities; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform occupational activities.  Id.

As noted above, entitlement to a benefit arises when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought.  Here, as previously discussed, the Veteran was in receipt of a 30 percent disability evaluation for PTSD, effective August 6, 2010 and a 70 percent disability evaluation, effective May 5, 2020; a 60 percent disability rating for his service-connected coronary artery disease, effective February 1, 2012; a 10 percent disability evaluation for his service-connected tinnitus, effective August 6, 2010; and noncompensable disability evaluations for his residuals of a right index finger fracture and bilateral hearing loss, effective August 6, 2010.  As such, the Veteran met the schedular criteria for TDIU effective February 1, 2012.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

However, the Veteran does not allege, and the evidence does not demonstrate, that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unemployable effective February 1, 2012.  The Veteran and his representative concede that the Veteran worked full-time until he retired in October 2014.  (see March 2019 and September 2020 VA Form 21-8940).  Nonetheless, based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities do not render him unable to obtain or sustain substantially gainful employment during the one-year period prior to January 31, 2019.  The evidence of record supports a finding that the Veteran, without regard to advancing age and nonservice-connected disabilities, was capable of performing the physical and mental actions required by employment during the rating period prior to January 31, 2019.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  

In this regard, the Board notes that there is no evidence of treatment for the Veteran's PTSD in 2018.  Additionally, at a December 2017 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he retired approximately 10 years prior after working for 31 years as a civil servant, and he did not indicate that he stopped working due to his service-connected disabilities.  Furthermore, VA treatment records from 2018 indicate that the Veteran was asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint.  To this point, the Board observes that the Veteran reported in September 2018 that he was doing fine since his last cardiology follow up in December 2017; he denied having shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, or syncope, and reported that he remained active and jogged for exercise.  Contemporaneous treatment notes indicate that the Veteran's cardiologist found that the Veteran's left ventricular ejection fraction was normal, and the last stress echocardiogram performed in 2016 was unremarkable.  Finally, there is no evidence in the medical records to support a conclusion that the Veteran's other service-connected disabilities of tinnitus, hearing loss, residuals of a right index fracture, and numerous scars interfered with his ability to work in 2018. 

Additionally, as to the Ray analysis, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran retired from his job as a mail courier in October 2014, and that the Veteran was employed there for over 11 years, since April 2003.  On his March 2019 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported that he became too disabled to work in October 2014 and that he retired from the Army in October 2008; the Veteran also reported that, in the prior twelve months, he earned $66,000.  Consequently, despite the Veteran's assertion that he lost time from work due to his service-connected conditions, there remains no objective evidence indicating that his earned annual income fell below the poverty threshold.  The Board also observes that the Veteran does not assert, and the evidence of record does not demonstrate, that his previous employer provided any accommodations for the symptoms and manifestations of his service-connected disabilities.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see also Ortiz-Valles v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 65, 71 (2016).

Moreover, to the extent that the Veteran's representative, in an attachment to the March 2023 VA Form 10182, argues that the Veteran is entitled to an effective date one year earlier than the Veteran's January 31, 2019 claim (namely, January 31, 2018) because the Veteran retired in 2014 due to his service-connected disabilities, the Board reiterates that the date of the Veteran's retirement in October 2014 was more than one year prior to the January 31, 2019 claim, and that, if entitlement to TDIU arose prior to January 31, 2018, then an effective date prior to January 31, 2019 cannot be assigned as the claim was not filed within a year of the increase.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  

Similarly, the Board finds the argument that the Veteran should be assigned an effective date of January 31, 2018 because he met the schedular requirements on January 31, 2018 unpersuasive.  To this point, the Board observes that the Veteran's representative, in the aforementioned March 2023 statement, conceded that the Veteran's PTSD "was not impacting his job."  Likewise, the argument of the Veteran's representative that the Veteran's coronary artery disease would prevent him from employment as a courier "today" due to reduced stamina and strength does not demonstrate entitlement an award of TDIU during the one-year period prior to the January 31, 2019 date of claim.  (see March 2023 attachment to VA Form 10182).  To this point, the Board reiterates that, if entitlement to TDIU arose after January 31, 2019, then the date of claim assigned as the effective date is the earliest date possible because the date entitlement arose would be after the date of claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities did not render him unable to obtain or retain substantially gainful employment for the rating period prior to January 31, 2019.  The claim of entitlement to an effective date prior to January 31, 2019 for the award of TDIU is denied.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 31, 2019 for the award of DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.

Regarding the Veteran's claim to an effective date prior to January 31, 2019, for the grant of eligibility for DEA benefits, the Board points out that DEA benefits under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 are available, in certain circumstances, when a Veteran has a total disability, permanent in nature, resulting from a service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3020, 21.3021.  As the effective date for the award of eligibility for DEA benefits is directly related to a finding that the Veteran is totally disabled due to service-connected disabilities, the appropriate effective date for the grant of entitlement to DEA benefits is January 31, 2019, the same date as the award of TDIU.

Thus, entitlement to an effective date prior to January 31, 2019, for the grant of eligibility for DEA benefits, is denied.
