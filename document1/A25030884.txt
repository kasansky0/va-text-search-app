ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

During the appeal period, the Veteran's bilateral hearing has been manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than Level I in the right ear and no worse than Level II in the left ear.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 1978 to April 1982.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the Veteran's January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), she elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Ratings are based on a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries.  The ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran asserts she is entitled to a compensable rating for her service-connected bilateral hearing loss because her hearing has worsened.  See November 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.  Additionally, she stated that she now requires hearing aids.  See both VA Forms 10182 from January 2023.  She also provides examples of the impact of her bilateral hearing loss from an earlier rating period, including not hearing the telephone ringing, not being able to hear while on the phone, and not hearing the television and radio.  See February 2023 Appellate Brief.  

The Veteran is in receipt of a noncompensable rating for her service-connected bilateral hearing loss, evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.  In November 2022, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-526EZ seeking a compensable rating.  The appeal period before the Board for the Veteran's claim begins on November 6, 2022, the date VA received her claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(A)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz).  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

To evaluate the degree of disability from bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII.  

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a).  In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Further, when the average pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b).

A December 2022 VA examination reveals that the Veteran reported that when she hears other people talking, she cannot discern what they say.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.10; Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007).  The Veteran's Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score and pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:  

December 2022 VA examination	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg.	Maryland CNC test

RIGHT	20	35	30	20	26.25	94%

LEFT	50	40	65	60	53.75	90%

Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level I in the right ear and Level II in the left ear.  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level I for the right ear and Level II for the left ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to noncompensable (zero percent) disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6100.  An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

Based on the December 2022 VA examination, a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is not warranted.  The record does not contain other current audiological results during the period on appeal.  

Generally, a veteran is competent to report difficulty hearing; however, disability ratings for hearing loss are derived from a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations resulting from audiometric testing.  See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

The rating criteria contemplate speech reception thresholds and ability to hear spoken words on Maryland CNC testing. The functional impact that the Veteran describes in her appellate brief is contemplated by the rating criteria.  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).  The Veteran's main complaint in the VA examination is reduced hearing acuity and clarity, which is what is contemplated in the rating assigned.  See Rossy v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 142, 145 (2017).

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss.  As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
