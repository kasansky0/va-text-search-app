ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

A September 2024 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD by adding PTSD to the description of the previously accepted acquired psychiatric disability. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for PTSD are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.104(c), 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2002 to November 2005. 

This appeal is being processed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran timely initiated this appeal to the Board by submitting a June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

In view of the above, the Board may only consider the evidence of record that the AOJ was permitted to consider at the time it issued the rating decision on appeal (i.e., the evidence of record at the time the AOJ issued the April 2024 rating decision).

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when evidence was not allowed. The Board is precluded from considering such evidence in this decision based on the Veteran's election of the Direct Review docket. The appellant may file a supplemental claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application for PTSD in January 2025. Submission of the supplemental claim while an appeal remained pending before the Board constitutes an impermissible concurrent election under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); however, this matter is nonetheless properly before the Board as the July 2024 VA Form 10182 was filed prior to submission of the supplemental claim and this appeal has not been withdrawn.

Service Connection

Entitlement to service connection on a direct basis requires (1) evidence of current nonservice-connected disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current nonservice-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018).

For VA purposes, all diagnosed mental disorders eligible for service connection must meet DSM-5 criteria as it is the most current diagnostic criteria for establishing a psychiatric diagnosis. See Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393 (2020).

A lay person is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by their senses; however, usually, they are not competent to prove a matter requiring medical expertise. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

After the evidence has been assembled, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a). When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

Entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

In his July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran asserted entitlement to service connection for PTSD. 

By way of procedural background, a March 2024 rating decision granted service connection for other specified anxiety disorder associated with migraine headache and assigned a 30 percent evaluation effective November 13, 2023. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD and depression were denied in this rating decision. In the April 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ again denied service connection for PTSD. 

While the present appeal of the April 2024 rating decision was pending, a September 2024 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD. The Board finds this to be a favorable finding. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

As specified under 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c):

Any finding favorable to the claimant made by either a VA adjudicator, as described in § 3.103(f)(4) ... is binding on all subsequent agency of original jurisdiction and Board of Veterans' Appeals adjudicators, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. For purposes of this section, a finding means a conclusion either on a question of fact or on an application of law to facts made by an adjudicator concerning the issue(s) under review.

In the September 2024 rating decision, the AOJ recharacterized the Veteran's service connected acquired psychiatric disability as "posttraumatic stress disorder to include other specified anxiety disorder associated with migraine headache." See also September 2024 Codesheet. Further, the Veteran's 30 percent evaluation for PTSD effective November 13, 2023, was increased to 100 percent effective May 16, 2024. Id; see 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). An evaluation of 100 percent is the highest schedular evaluation for PTSD permitted under the law. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. 

Based on the favorable findings in the September 2024 rating decision, the Board finds service connection for PTSD is warranted.
