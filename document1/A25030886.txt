REMANDED

Entitlement to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill or Chapter 33) educational assistance benefits under the Transfer of Entitlement (ToE) program is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran appeals an initial decision issued on February 9, 2023. Therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act, applies.

On the February 20, 2023, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim.

Entitlement to Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits under the ToE program is remanded.

A February 2023 decision denied entitlement to Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits under the ToE program. The Veteran appeals the decision. See VA Form 10182 (February 2023) ("Denied my GI Transer [sic] to daughters").

The Board finds that remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the February 2023 decision on appeal. In this regard, prior to the decision on appeal, the AOJ did not obtain relevant records in the custody of a Federal department or agency.

The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) duty to assist includes obtaining records in the custody of a Federal department or agency; and VA may end its efforts to obtain records if VA concludes that the records sought do not exist or that further efforts to obtain these records would be futile. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(c)(1)(C); 

38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2).

Here, the Veteran's education file is not of record. In this regard, a review of the record is absent of information or facts the AOJ used in denying Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits under the ToE program. Indeed, not even the decision on appeal is in the record. Decisions of the Board must be based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal, and any additional evidence considered as part of the evidentiary record pursuant to applicable statute and regulation. 38 U.S.C. 

§§ 7104(d), 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). However, in this instance, the record on appeal is not complete for the Board to adjudicate the issue.

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the February 2023 decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

In remanding this matter, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions. Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.
