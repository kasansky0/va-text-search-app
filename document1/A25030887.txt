ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for migraines is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In April 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision denying the Veteran's claim for service connection for migraines and sleep apnea

2. In May 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996: Higher-Level Review Request, requesting a higher-level review of the April 2022 rating decision.

3. In June 2022, the AOJ issued notice to the Veteran that a duty to assist error was identified during the higher-level review, and the Veteran's claims would undergo further review; this notice is not a final decision. 

4. In July 2022, while the higher-level review request was still pending, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 to appeal the April 2022 decision to the Board.

5. In September 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for migraines and sleep apnea. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for migraines and sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1996 to April 1998.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which denied entitlement to service connection for migraines and sleep apnea. 

The Veteran appealed this decision with the submission of a July 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, and requested Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

1. Entitlement to service connection for migraines is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) framework, there are three administrative review options following an AOJ decision on a claim: (1) Higher-Level Review, (2) Supplemental Claim, and (3) Board Appeal. If a request for review of a claim, such as the Veteran's claim, under one of these three administrative review options lanes is pending final adjudication, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different lane without first withdrawing the pending review request. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500 (d), (e), 20.205.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) emphasized that concurrent elections are prohibited. See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). The Court held that a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the one-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option. Terry, 37 Vet. App. at 2-3. This holding was expressly predicated on finding that multiple administrative review requests were "not pending concurrently" as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a)(2)(A). Id. Accordingly only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues. Id. 

By way of background, the Veteran filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for migraines and sleep apnea in January 2022. In an April 2022 rating decision, the AOJ denied both claims. 

As detailed above, the Veteran appealed these denials in May 2022 by submitting a VA Form 20-0996: Higher-Level Review Request, requesting a higher-level review of the April 2022 rating decision. 

In June 2022, the AOJ determined that duty to assist errors had occurred at the time of the April 2022 rating decision. As a result, the AOJ informed the Veteran in a June 2022 notification letter that further development was necessary, and that it would develop the Veteran's claim by obtaining additional, clarifying medical opinions. At that time, the appeal remained pending.

In July 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement to appeal the April 2022 rating decision directly to the Board. Then, more than a year later in September 2023, the AOJ issued the rating decision resulting from the June 2022 higher-level review, confirming the denials of service connection for migraines and sleep apnea. 

The procedural history above demonstrates that in this case, the Veteran's July 2022 submission of a VA Form 10182 was an attempt at a concurrent election of a second appeal. In other words, it appears that the Veteran attempted to initiate an appeal to the Board while a higher-level review appeal was still pending. Indeed, the submission of the VA Form 10182 came before the Veteran was notified of the September 2023 higher-level review rating decision, and the Veteran indicated that his appeal was of the April 2022 rating decision. Since the Veteran did not explicitly withdraw his higher-level review appeal, this type of concurrent election is prohibited. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b), (e)(1). As such, the Board appeal must be dismissed. 

Additionally, the Board notes that in a February 2025 Correspondence, the Veteran stated that he believed the June 2022 higher-level review determination was a final denial of his appeal. While the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran, the June 2022 higher-level review determination that duty to assist errors had occurred at the time of the April 2022 rating decision was not a denial, or a final decision. Therefore, even if the July 2022 submission of the VA Form 10182 were interpreted as a response to the June 2022 higher-level review determination, this decision was not final, and therefore was not appealable to the Board. 

As such, the appeal must be dismissed as a matter of law. Id. 

Should the Veteran wish to continue to pursue these claims, he may consult with his representative to file a Supplemental Claim or submit a motion to the AOJ alleging Clear and Unmistakable Error in the April 2022 or September 2023 rating decisions.
