ORDER

A retroactive payment of $2,748.00 based on the award of an increased 20 percent rating for left achilles tendonitis effective May 14, 2009, was proper; the appeal is denied.

A retroactive payment of $15,490.86 based on the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) effective October 6, 2020, was not proper as the Veteran was owed $16,995.26; payment to the Veteran of $1504.40 is granted.

A retroactive payment of $149,589.82 based on the award of an earlier effective date for a TDIU from August 14, 2014, was proper; the appeal is denied.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. An August 2022 rating decision granted a 20 percent rating for left foot achilles tendonitis from May 14, 2009, which resulted in a changed to the combined rating from 40 percent to 50 percent; the resulting retroactive payment due to that change was $2,748.  

2. An August 2021 rating decision granted entitlement to a TDIU effective October 6, 2020, which resulted in a retroactive payment of $16,995.26, but the Veteran was only paid $15,490.86 82 due to an erroneous existing $1504.40 severance pay debt.

3. The $1504.40 severance pay debt was due to sole administrative error and should not be charged to the Veteran; thus, the Veteran is owed this amount from VA.

4. In March 2022, the Board awarded a TDIU from August 14, 2014, which was implemented in an April 2022 rating decision; the resulting retroactive payment totaled $149,589.82.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Payment of a retroactive award of $2,748.00 based on an increased 20 percent rating for left achilles tendonitis effective May 14, 2009, was proper.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.25, Diagnostic Code 5271.

2. Payment of a retroactive award of $15,490.86 82 based on a TDIU grant effective October 6, 2020, was not proper; the Veteran is owed $1504.70. 10 U.S.C. § 1174; 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5304.

3. Payment of a retroactive award of $149,589.82 based on the grant of an earlier effective date for a TDIU from August 14, 2014, was proper.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.16, 4.25.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1974 to November 1977.

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from October 6, 2022, October 6, 2022, and October 21, 2022, notification letters of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which retroactively granted payments of $2,748.00, $149,589.82, and $15,490.86 82, respectively.  In March 2023, the Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board via his submission of a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), on which he elected the Direct Review docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the notification letters on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Payment History

The Veteran was originally granted service connection for left achilles tendonitis effective January 2002.  In a January 2007 rating decision, in pertinent part, the disability rating for achilles tendonitis was increased to 10 percent from August 11, 2004.  In addition, service connection was granted for a right comminuted patella fracture with a rating of 100 percent because of the need for surgical convalescence from October 6, 2005, to January 1, 2006, and then 30 percent from January 1, 2006.  From January 1, 2006, the combined rating was 40 percent.  In August 2007, the temporary total rating was extended to September 1, 2006.  

The Veteran was then deemed to be in fugitive felon status, so his VA compensation was terminated.  That action resulted in a debt totaling $16,635.  The Veteran was notified of the debt in April 2008.  However, in May 2008, VA notified the Veteran that information had been received which showed the warrant had been recalled, so his VA compensation benefits were retroactively restored.  Thus, there was no overpayment.  The Veteran was also advised that VA would withhold a portion of his VA compensation benefits until his severance pay of $2,912.40 was recouped.  The severance pay was for the Veteran's left foot achilles tendonitis.  VA withheld $106 per month for the period from September 1, 2004, through November 1, 2004, and $108 per month for the period from December 1, 2004, through October 1, 2005.  The withholding was suspended for the period from November 1, 2005, through August 1, 2006, because the Veteran had received a temporary total rating for his service-connected disability.  Thereafter VA withheld $112 per month for the period from September 1, 2006, through November 1, 2006; $115 per month for the period from December 1, 2006, through August 1, 2007; and $35.40 for September 1, 2007.  The last withholding of $35.40 brought the total to $2,912.40 which equaled the amount of the severance pay.

In a June 2009 rating decision, the RO, in pertinent part, denied an increased rating for right comminuted patella fracture.

In January 2010, a claim for a TDIU was received.

An October 2011 rating decision denied an increased rating left achilles tendonitis, and also denied a TDIU.

In a May 2015 rating decision, service connection for a scar, status post right knee surgery, was granted with a 0 percent rating effective October 6, 2005.  In addition, the RO determined that a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) was made in assigning a 30 percent rating in the January 2007 rating decision, and the RO proposed to reduce the 30 percent rating to 10 percent for residuals of right comminuted patella fracture.  At that point, the Veteran was receiving a combined 40 percent rating.

In June 2015, VA reiterated that a portion of the Veteran's VA compensation benefits had been withheld to recoup his severance pay and the mathematical payment figures were again provided, per the May 2008 letter.  The total was $2,912.40 which equaled the amount of the severance pay.

In June 2015, the Veteran was advised that the proposed action based on CUE was taken, so his monthly benefits were being reduced, and an overpayment would result.  An April 2016 rating decision then continued the 30 percent rating for the right knee, so there was no reduction.  The combined rating remained 40 percent.

An April 2018 Board decision addressed appeals for increased ratings for left achilles tendonitis and right knee disability, and also a TDIU, denying all three appeals.

In a July 2018 notice, the RO responded to the Veteran's inquiry that VA erroneously indicated that he was incarcerated, and that VA owed him $16,585.00.  (As noted, there was no overpayment charged to the Veteran.)  The RO also noted that the Veteran had requested an audit of his award in regard to his compensation and funds that VA had withheld.  Included in his inquiry was a question as to why VA withheld his severance pay twice, once in 2012 and the other 2016.  Upon review of the Veteran's file, the RO indicated that it had discovered that in the May 9, 2008, letter, the Veteran was informed that VA reinstated his compensation benefits effective September 1, 2004.  In addition, the Veteran was informed that VA received information from a Court official that the warrant issued on September 5, 1997, was recalled effective September 5, 1997, therefore no incarceration adjustment was initiated, and no funds were withheld as a result.  The letter also explained that VA only withheld for severance pay from September 1, 2004, to December 1, 2007.  The total amount withheld was $2,912.40, which was only done once.  

In an October 2018 rating decision, in pertinent part, service connection for tension headaches was granted with a rating of 0 percent effective April 2018; an increased rating for scarring of the right knee was denied.  The combined rating remained 40 percent.

In a May 2019 rating decision, in pertinent part, increased ratings for right knee scarring and tension headaches were denied.  

The Veteran appealed the issues denied in the April 2018 Board decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) which vacated the Board's decision.  In August 2019, the Board remanded these matters (increased rating for left achilles tendonitis and right knee disability, and a TDIU) to the RO pursuant to a Joint Motion for Remand.

In January 2020, the RO found no prior VA errors as follows, and that VA did not owe the Veteran any retroactive pay.  It was noted that the RO had completed several audits of his account to which he had been notified.  In pertinent part, a July 25, 2019, notification letter indicated that the RO had previously reinstated his VA compensation benefits effective September 1, 2004, after a warrant was recalled, so there was also no incarceration adjustment, and no funds were withheld as a result (i.e. no overpayment was charged or recouped from the Veteran).  The letter also explained that VA only withheld for severance pay from September 1, 2004, to December 1, 2007.  The total amount withheld was $2,912.40 (the amount of the severance pay), which was only done once.  

A May 2020 rating decision, in pertinent part, confirmed and continued the ratings for right knee and tension headache disabilities. 

A June 2020 Higher Level Review denied the following matters: that payment of convalescence pay which was previously withheld in error due erroneous report of incarceration for a felony crime, replacement of retroactive payment for check that was cashed by someone other than the Veteran, and that payment of compensation due to withholding of separation pay twice.

An October 2020 rating decision, in pertinent part, increased the disability rating for tension headaches to 30 percent effective September 11, 2020.  The increased rating increased the combined rating to 60 percent from September 11, 2020.

A March 2021 rating decision then assigned the 30 percent rating for tension headaches back to April 5, 2018.  The combined 60 percent rating was also made effective from that date.  There was a typographical error in the notification which indicated the effective date was April 2008, but it was actually, as indicated, April 2018.

Another March 2021 rating decision granted service connection for left ear hearing loss with a 0 percent rating effective May 13, 2020.  The combined rating was unchanged.

An April 2021 rating decision again indicated that a 30 percent rating was assigned for tension headaches from April 5, 2018.  This action corrected the typographical error on the effective date.

A subsequent April 2021 rating decision increased the 30 percent rating for tension headaches to 50 percent effective October 6, 2020.  The 0 percent rating for knee scarring was continued.  

In another April 2021 rating decision, the rating for left foot achilles tendonitis was increased to 20 percent effective May 10, 2010.  

The combined ratings changed as follows: 50 percent from May 10, 2010, 60 percent from April 5, 2018, and 70 percent from October 6, 2020.

In a May 2021 letter, the RO indicated that it had carefully taken into consideration the Veteran's request for an audit of its rating decision and review of the previously recouped disability severance pay.  On March 12, 2021, the RO received the Veteran's request for an audit related to the March 3, 2021, rating decision.  The RO provided the Veteran with an audit of the Veteran's retroactive compensation payment created from VA award action on March 3, 2021.  The audit compared the amount the Veteran was previously paid prior to implementation of the rating decision and the amount due from VA after the implementation of the rating decision.  The audit confirmed the retroactive payment of $14,372.60, which was sent on March 3, 2021.  The RO noted that the Veteran received a severance pay allowance of $2,912.40 from the military for his left foot achilles tendonitis.  The RO stated that during the review, it was determined that from September 1, 2004, to December 1, 2007, VA recouped $4,338.00 due to his disability severance allowance, recouping $1,425.60 too much.  However, this was rectified with VA award action dated June 1, 2015, in which the RO corrected the gross amount of disability severance pay recoupment, which resulted in $1,425.60 to be released to him.  However, the notification letter dated June 2, 2015, did not provide him notification of this correction. 

In a June 2021 letter, the RO stated that it received the Veteran's request to review his award history and a breakdown of the retroactive payment of $20,614.59 between January 1, 2021, and May 31, 2021.  The first decision was on March 4, 2021.  A 30 percent rating was assigned for tension headaches from April 5, 2018.  This created a retroactive payment of $14,372.60, which was deposited in his account on March 8, 2021.  The second decision was on March 29, 2021.  Nothing was granted in that decision; therefore, no retroactive payment was created.  The third decision was on April 2, 2021.  Service connection for left ear hearing loss was granted with a rating of 0 percent effective May 13, 2020.  This decision did not grant anything above 0 percent and did not create a retroactive payment.  The fourth decision was on April 14, 2021.  A 30 percent rating was assigned for tension headaches effective from April 5, 2018.  This was previously already granted in the decision dated October 28, 2020, that was effective September 11, 2020.  This decision was a duplicate decision of March 4, 2021, decision which gave the retroactive payment of $14,372.60.  The fifth decision was on April 23, 2021.  The rating for tension headaches, which was 30 percent disabling, was increased to 50 percent effective October 6, 2020.  This created a retroactive payment of $4,698.49.  This was deposited into the Veteran's account on April 27, 2021, in the amount of $4,400.17 and then on April 30, 2021, in the amount of $298.32.  The RO stated that this amount was in error because it gave back the previous amount that VA withheld for severance pay, but VA was then to correct this error on the decision dated May 3, 2021, by withholding the severance pay again.  The sixth decision was on May 3, 2021.  The rating for the left foot achilles tendonitis, which was currently 10 percent disabling, was increased to 20 percent effective May 10, 2010.  This created the $21,622.59 retroactive payment.  The RO was then to withhold severance pay of $1504.40 from the original retroactive payment of $21,622.59, but the RO deposited $20,614.59 on May 6, 2021, and $1,008.00 on May 21, 2021.  The RO created a debt of $1504.40 for the severance pay that the RO was supposed to withhold. 

In August 2021, the RO provided the Veteran a payment history to show he was paid correctly.  His rating changed from 10 percent to 100 percent effective October 6, 2005, 100 percent to 40 percent effective September 1, 2006, 40 percent to 50 percent effective May 10, 2010, 50 percent to 60 percent effective April 5, 2018, 60 percent to 70 percent effective October 6, 2020.

An August 2021 rating decision granted entitlement to a TDIU effective October 6, 2020.  In September 2021, the RO advised the Veteran that an audit was performed that the retroactive payment paid to him on September 7, 2021, in the amount of $15,490.86 was accurate and correct.  

A March 2022 Board decision denied entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for a right knee disability based on recurrent subluxation or lateral instability; granted a separate 30 percent rating for right knee disability based on limitation of flexion from August 14, 2014; granted a 20 percent rating for left Achilles tendonitis from May 14, 2009; and granted entitlement to a TDIU from August 14, 2014.  The Board remanded the matter of entitlement to TDIU prior to August 14, 2014, on an extraschedular basis pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §4.16(b).

An April 2022 letter from the RO informed the Veteran the historical payment information since his original compensation grant of September 1, 2004, to the current time, were made accurately and correctly.  Thus, there were no additional compensation payments due at the current time, within the scope of a recent audit request.  However, the RO noted that he had other claims pending at the present time so after the finalization of the pending claims, more adjustment may be made to his VA compensation award benefits.  The current mathematical figures were provided.

Thereafter, an April 2022 rating decision implemented the Board's March 2022 award determinations.  The Veteran had a combined 0 percent rating from January 17, 2002; a combined 10 percent rating from August 11, 2004; a temporary 100 percent rating from October 6, 2005; a combined 40 percent rating from September 1, 2006; a combined 50 percent rating from May 10, 2010; a combined 70 percent rating from August 14, 2014; an 80 percent combined rating from April 5, 2018; and a 100 percent TDIU rating from August 14, 2014.  The retroactive award totaled $149,589.82.  

A subsequent April 2022 rating decision granted entitlement to special monthly compensation based on the need for aid and attendance from December 16, 2021.  

An August 2022 rating decision granted a 20 percent rating for left foot achilles tendonitis from May 14, 2009.  That award changed the combined ratings as follows: 50 percent combined rating was warranted from May 14, 2009, instead of from May 10, 2010.  That resulted in an award of $2,748.

A September 2022 Board decision granted entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis for the period from January 14, 2010.  A September 2022 rating decision implemented the Board's award.  This means that the overall effective date for TDIU was January 14, 2010. However, the payment resulting from this award is not currently before the Board. 

An October 2022 electronic mail indicated that the Veteran had only received $15,490.86 of the $16,995.26 award, which was $1,504.40 short.  

1. Retroactive Payment of $2,748.00

The October 5, 2022, letter determined that the retroactive payment of $2,748.00 is correct.  The RO stated that it is necessary to distinguish the effective date of entitlement from the effective date of payment.  The effective date of entitlement is the date from which the Veteran is found eligible to receive compensation benefits at a specified rate.  The effective date of payment is the date from which payment begins based on such entitlement.  The actual payment of VA benefits is always made one month in arrears.  For example, benefits due a beneficiary for the month of November are deposited in his/her account at the end of November or the beginning of December.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.31, VA may not pay monetary benefits based on an original, supplemental or increased award of compensation for any period prior to the first day of the calendar month following the month in which the beneficiary became entitled to the benefit.

In the August 22, 2022, rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection at the 20 percent rate effective May 14, 2009, which increased his combined rating evaluation to 50 percent effective May 14, 2009.  This represents the effective date of entitlement.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.31, increased payment cannot take effect until June 1, 2009, which represents the effective date of payment.  This decision was authorized on August 24, 2022, which means that the increased compensation payable for the months June 1, 2022, through August 31, 2022, was owed to the Veteran.  The Veteran was advised that VA must deduct the amount he already received prior to the rating increase as he could not receive a combination of both.  He was receiving the 40 percent service connection rate from June 1, 2009, to May 31, 2010, the 50 percent service connection rate from May 1, 2010, to August 31, 2014, and the 100 percent service connection rate from September 1, 2014, to August 31, 2022.  Therefore, those amounts must be deducted from the 50 percent rate increase from June 1, 2009.  Therefore, the RO determined that the retroactive payment of $2,748.00 is correct and was paid to the Veteran on August 29, 2022.  The payment table was provided to the Veteran.

In sum, the August 2022 rating decision granted a 20 percent rating for left foot achilles tendonitis from May 14, 2009.  That award changed the combined rating.  The 50 percent combined rating was warranted from May 14, 2009, instead of from May 10, 2010.  Since the Veteran had already been paid at the 40 percent rate, that amount was deducted from the newly awarded 50 percent rate under the combined rating table.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.25 (combined ratings table).  That action resulted in an award of $2,748.  Therefore, the retroactive award of $2,748 was proper.

2. Retroactive Payment of $15,490.86

An August 2021 rating decision granted entitlement to a TDIU effective October 6, 2020.  In March 2022, the Board granted entitlement to TDIU from August 14, 2014.  In a September 2022 decision, the Board then granted entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis for the period from January 14, 2010.  

An October 21, 2022, letter subsequently notified the Veteran that an August 22, 2021, rating decision granted a TDIU effective October 2020.  This letter pertained to the August 2021 rating decision.  That effective date was the basis for the $15,490.86 payment.

The Board notes that it is apparent that these letters were confusing to the Veteran because when the October 21, 2022, letter was issued, he had already been granted entitlement to a TDIU from an earlier effective date.  As such, the Veteran disputes that he was accurately paid the retractive award for his TDIU and repeatedly requested audits of that calculation.  However, even though earlier effective dates were subsequently implemented, the matter before the Board is whether the Veteran was properly paid in accordance with the October 2020 effective date, even though that was then subject to later favorable change.

Thus, while the Board acknowledges the Veteran's confusion, the decision herein only considers whether the earlier incremental grant was properly paid.

An October 21, 2022, letter informed the Veteran that VA determined that the retroactive payment of $15,490.86 is correct.  In the August 22, 2021, rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to a TDIU effective October 6, 2020.  This represents the effective date of entitlement, with payment from November 1, 2020.  See 38 C.F.R.§ 3.31.  The RO advised the Veteran that VA must deduct the amount he already received prior to the rating increase as he was not entitled to receive a combination of both.  The Veteran was receiving the 70 percent rate from November 1, 2020, to August 31, 2021.  Therefore, those amounts must be deducted from the TDIU grant.  However, the RO also stated that he had an existing disability severance pay debt of $1,504.40 that was taken from the retroactive payment and applied to the debt ($16,995.26 less $1,504.40 equals $15,490.86).  Therefore, the retroactive payment of $15,490.86 is correct.  The payment table was provided to the Veteran.

At this juncture, the Veteran was previously notified twice that VA recouped the severance pay by September 2007.  Specifically, VA withheld $106 per month for the period from September 1, 2004, through November 1, 2004, and $108 per month for the period from December 1, 2004, through October 1, 2005.  The withholding was suspended for the period from November 1, 2005, through August1, 2006, because the Veteran had received a temporary total rating for his service-connected disability.  Thereafter VA withheld $112 per month for the period from September 1, 2006, through November 1, 2006; $115 per month for the period from December 1, 2006, through August 1, 2007; and $35.40 for September 1, 2007.  The last withholding of $35.40 brought the total to $2,912.40.  In May 2021, the RO indicated that the Veteran received a severance pay allowance of $2,912.40 from the military for his left foot achilles tendonitis.  It was determined that from September 1, 2004, to December 1, 2007, VA recouped $4,338.00 due to his disability severance allowance, recouping $1,425.60 too much.  However, in any event, the RO indicated that this was rectified with VA award action dated June 1, 2015, in which the RO corrected the gross amount of disability severance pay recoupment, which resulted in $1,425.60 to be released to the Veteran.  Thus, the severance pay matter appeared resolved at that point.  It is unclear why the RO created a debt of $1504.40 when the severance pay should have already been recouped.  Even assuming that the RO overpaid the Veteran which resulted in a debt of $1504.40, that was clearly due to sole administrative error.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5112(b)(10), the effective date of a reduction or discontinuance of compensation by reason of an erroneous award based solely on administrative error or error in judgment shall be the date of last payment.  See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.500 (b)(2).  "Stated another way, when an overpayment has been made by reason of an erroneous award based solely on administrative error, the reduction of that award cannot be made retroactive to form an overpayment debt owed to VA from the recipient of the erroneous award."  Erickson v. West, 13 Vet. App. 495, 499 (2000).  The Board notes, however, that sole administrative error may be found to occur only in cases where the Veteran neither had knowledge of nor should have been aware of the erroneous award.  Further, such error contemplates that neither the Appellant's actions nor his failure to act contributed to the erroneous award.  38 U.S.C. § 5112(b)(10); 38 C.F.R. § 3.500(b)(2).

In this case, there was sole administrative error because the RO apparently erroneously paid the Veteran, and it is not reasonable that the Veteran would have had knowledge or should have been aware of that payment.  Moreover, the RO seeks to recoup that money at the present time, which is clearly outside the one-year window following its creation.  38 U.S.C. § 5302B(a) bans the collection/creation of debts against Veterans that result from the failure to process information within applicable timeliness standards established by the Secretary.  In other words, it basically bans the creation or collection of debts created due to excessive administrative delay or processing errors.

In December 2023, VA's Assistant Deputy Under Secretary, Office of Policy and Oversight (VBA) issued a Memorandum entitled "Temporary Timeliness Instruction, providing guidelines for implementing the statute pending formal rulemaking.  The memorandum provides that absent delays directly attributable to a beneficiary's actions, VA must issue a Decision Notification Letter based on information provided by or on behalf of a beneficiary within one year from the date of claim.  When VA fails to do so, VA will not create additional debt for overpayments made more than 1 year from the date of claim.  The memorandum provides that its instructions apply to all debt collection activities pending and nonfinal on June 27, 2023.

As such, the Board finds that the record does not show a valid $1504.40 debt was ever created, and if there was overpayment, it was the result of sole administrative error and should not be charged to the Veteran.  Accordingly, he should have been paid the full $16,995.26 retroactive payment, and not the reduced payment of $15,490.86.  He is therefore owed $1504.40.

3. Retroactive Payment of $149,589.82

As noted above, the August 2021 rating decision granted entitlement to a TDIU effective October 6, 2020.  In March 2022, the Board granted entitlement to TDIU from August 14, 2014.  In a September 2022 decision, the Board then granted entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis for the period from January 14, 2010.  The only matter addressed herein for the same reasons previously explained is whether the payment based on the earlier effective date of TDIU of August 14, 2014, was proper.

An October 6, 2022, letter informed the Veteran that the retroactive payment of $149,589.82 is correct.  In the April 14, 2022, rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection at the 30 percent rate effective August 14, 2014, TDIU effective August 14, 2014, payable from September 1, 2014.  See 38 C.F.R.§ 3.31.  This decision was authorized on April 14, 2022, which means that the increased compensation payable for the months September 1, 2014, through March 31, 2022, was owed to the Veteran.  The Veteran was advised that VA must deduct the amount the Veteran already received prior to his rating increase as he was not entitled to receive a combination of both.  The Veteran was receiving the 50 percent rate from September 1, 2014, to April 30, 2018, the 60 percent rate from May 1, 2018, to October 31, 2020, and the 100 percent service connection rate from November 1, 2020, to March 31, 2022.  Therefore, those amounts must be deducted from the 100 TDIU rate effective September 1, 2014.  Therefore, it was determined that the retroactive payment of $149,589.82 is correct and was paid to the Veteran on April 19, 2022.  The payment table was provided to the Veteran.

In sum, in March 2022, the Board awarded a TDIU from August 14, 2014, which was then implemented by the RO in an April 2022 rating decision, payable from September 1, 2014, resulting in a retroactive award totaled $149,589.82.  Therefore, the retroactive award of $149,589.82 was proper.
