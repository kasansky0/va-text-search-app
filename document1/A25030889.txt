ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Veteran's OSA is caused by to his service-connected PTSD and lumbar spine degenerative arthritis.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for OSA have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Marine Corps on active duty from September 2001 to September 2005. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2021 rating decision by the Regional Office (RO).

The Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review Request in October 2021, in response to a June 2021 initial rating decision. In the January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. The Veteran submitted a extension request with the Notice of Disagreement, which was granted.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

A veteran is entitled to VA disability compensation if there is a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131. Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be also established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R § 3.310 (a). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) proximately caused by or (b) proximately aggravated by a service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) 

The benefit of the doubt rule provides that a veteran will prevail in a case where the positive evidence is in a relative balance with the negative evidence.  Therefore, the Veteran prevails in a claim when: (1) the weight of the evidence supports the claim, or (2) when the evidence is in approximate balance.  It is only when the weight of the evidence is against the claim that the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

The Veteran contends his sleep apnea is secondary to his service-connected lumbar spine degenerative arthritis and PTSD. See Statement in Support of Claim, June 2020.

In the December 2021 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of OSA. This favorable finding is binding on the Board, and the first element of service connection is therefore met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104 (c), 3.303; Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67.

As part of the Veteran's original claim for OSA, he submitted a May 2020 private medical opinion. The clinician opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's weight gain was due to and/or related to his service-connected PTSD and degenerative arthritis, lumbar spine; and that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's OSA was secondary to, related to, and/or aggravated by the weight gain from the service-connected PTSD and degenerative arthritis, lumbar spine. Finally, the clinician concluded that it was least as likely as not that without the Veteran's weight gain his OSA would not have occurred. The examiner cited to medical literature supporting the opinion. The clinician also noted the Veteran gained 10 pounds during service and 10 pounds after service, making him overweight according to his BMI. The clinician reasoned that medical literature supports depression, anxiety, and mood disturbances can lead to overeating and Veteran's with PTSD have a greater likelihood of being overweight. Obesity was the primary risk factor of developing OSA, and studies showed a relationship between chronic pain and chronic sleep impairment. The clinician noted the Veteran's difficulty sleeping, difficulty initiating sleep, and difficulty maintaining sleep due to pain in his spine. 

The Veteran was afforded a July 2020 VA examination. The clinician opined that the Veteran's claimed OSA, was less likely than not (less than 50% probability) incurred in or caused by the injury during service, reasoning, that the Veteran's separation exam did not identify an injury that could have caused the Veteran's OSA and the symptoms of OSA began 10 years post discharge from service. The examiner attributed OSA to blockages in the airway usually when the soft tissue in the back of the throat collapses during sleep. In the Veteran's case, a major cause of his OSA was a crowded oropharynx with a small upper airway. The examiner further opined, on a secondary basis, that the Veteran's OSA was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's disabilities, to include PTSD and Degenerative arthritis, lumbar spine. The examiner addressed the private clinician's opinion that weight gain due to the Veteran's service-connected PTSD and lumbar spine arthritis was the cause of the OSA, stating that the "Veteran's mild weight gain from service entrance in 2001 to 2020 of 20 lbs is multifactorial-poor diet, calorie intake, lack of exercise, and normal aging." Again, the examiner attributed the OSA to blockage of the airway, usually when the soft tissue in the back of the throat collapses during sleep. 

The Veteran submitted a subsequent private opinion from August 2020. The clinician opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's OSA was secondary, related to, and/or aggravated by service-connected conditions to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and degenerative arthritis, lumbar spine with subsequent sleep disturbance and weight gain. The clinician noted similar medical literature in agreement with the May 2020 private clinician. The clinician specifically called attention to a study which found, "[c]ompared with participants with a stable weight, those that have a 10% increase in their weight had on average a 32% increase in their AHI and a sixfold risk of developing moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea." This study specifically refutes the VA examiner's opinion that mild weight gain was not the cause of the Veteran's OSA. 

The Veteran was afforded a June 2021 VA examination. The examiner diagnosed OSA and opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was caused by or incurred in service. The examiner noted a report of medical examination from 2003, at which the Veteran stated he was "unable to get sound sleep related to his back pain." But the examiner disregarded this record, stating, there was no evidence of chronic sleeping difficulties secondary to snoring, nightmares causing insomnia or complaints of excessive daytime fatigue, consistent with OSA. And the Veteran wasn't diagnosed with OSA until 12 years after he had separated from service. 

In cases such as this where there are medical opinions with differing conclusions, the Board must assess the credibility and weight of all the evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value. Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614 (1992); Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164 (1991). Furthermore, the VA has a duty to uphold the benefit of the doubt rule, and in cases where the evidence is in approximate balance, service connection must be granted. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board finds the private medical opinions probative, as they reflected reasoned consideration of the evidence of record and included sufficient explanation and citation to reliable sources. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). The clinicians explained the multifactorial causes of the Veteran's OSA consistent with his medical history. The Board acknowledges the negative opinions provided by the VA examiners. However, the Board gives little weight to these opinions. The examiners' rationale did not include discussion of all of the evidence presented by the private examiner, specifically as to the influence of chronic pain on sleep deprivation and weight gain from PTSD. Both VA opinions are improperly conclusory and less fully reasoned than the private opinions.

Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, as secondary to PTSD and degenerative arthritis, lumbar spine, is granted. 38 U.S.C. §§1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§3.102, 3.310; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391, 1394 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
