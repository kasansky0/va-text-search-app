CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the appeal must be dismissed without prejudice. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States from June 1980 to September 1982. In February and March 2021, the Veteran filed claims with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In July 2021, the VA Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision pertinent to the issues on appeal. In December 2021, the Veteran noted a timely appeal of the rating decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  

The appeal was prosecuted pursuant to the modernized review system.   

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran died in March 2025, while his appeal was pending before the Board. As a matter of law, an appellant's claim does not survive their death. Therefore, the appeal must be dismissed, without prejudice. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302. There are, however, provisions in place to allow for an eligible person to take the Veteran's place in his appeal in order to get a final decision. 38 U.S.C. § 5121A. This process is called substitution. The request to be substituted must be filed within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(b).

 To file a request for substitution, an eligible person may use VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant," which can be found online here: https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21P-0847-ARE.pdf. 

The completed form may be submitted electronically via ACCESSVA. The web address for ACCESSVA is https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=dmhs. 

Alternatively, the completed form can be mailed to:

Department of Veterans Affairs

Pension Intake Center

PO Box 5365

Janesville, WI 53547-5365

A person seeking substitution may also submit the form directly to their nearest RO. To find the nearest RO go to https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?facilityType=benefits. Only certain persons are eligible for substitution. A person eligible for substitution includes "a living person who would be eligible to receive accrued benefits due to the claimant under section 5121(a) of this title . . . ." 38 U.S.C. § 5121A(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a). There is a factsheet that helps explains who is eligible for accrued benefits, which can be found online here: https://benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/factsheets/general/Accrued.pdf.

"Upon VA's grant of a request to substitute, the substitute may continue the claim or appeal on behalf of the deceased claimant for purposes of processing the claim or appeal to completion." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010. "If the agency of original jurisdiction grants the request to substitute, the case will assume its original place on the docket . . . ." 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.
