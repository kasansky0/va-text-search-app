FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In January 2023, VA sent the Veteran a proposal to reduce his compensation payments by removing his dependent children, X., U., and S., from his award of VA disability compensation, effective from the first day of the month after VA last received verification of the Veteran's dependents, and informed the Veteran that he had 60 days to show why his benefits should not be reduced by returning the enclosed VA Form 21-686c, Declaration of Status of Dependents.

2. In August 2023, VA sent the Veteran a letter stating that it had not received the information verifying the Veteran's dependents requested in the January 2023 letter, and, as such, the Veteran's dependent children, X., U., and S., were removed from his award of VA benefits from the date that he last verified his dependents.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Marine Corps from May 2000 to August 2000 and March 2003 to February 2004. 

In an August 2023 decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) removed the Veteran's dependent children, X., U., and S., from his award of VA disability compensation effective from the date that the dependents were last verified. In October 2023, the Veteran appealed the August 2023 decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ. Under direct review, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of the date of the August 2023 decision.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Additionally, the Board notes that in the October 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran also appealed the issue of the debt created due to the overpayment caused by the removal of his dependent children, and this matter will be addressed by the Board in a separate decision. 

REDUCTION OF DEPENDENCY BENEFITS

A Veteran who is in receipt of disability compensation of 30 percent or more is entitled to an additional allowance for each dependent. 38 U.S.C. § 1115. Here, the Veteran's combined disability rating has been at least 30 percent since May 2010.

Except as otherwise specified at § 3.103(b)(3), where a reduction or discontinuance of benefits is warranted by reason of information received concerning dependency, or marital or other status, a proposal for the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. The beneficiary will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that the benefits should be continued at their present level. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received within that period, final adverse action will be taken, and the award will be reduced or discontinued effective as specified under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.500 through 3.503. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(h).

In lieu of advance notice and opportunity for a hearing, VA will send a written notice to the beneficiary or his or her fiduciary at the same time it takes an adverse action when the adverse action is based solely on factual and unambiguous information or statements as to dependency or marital status that the beneficiary provided to VA in writing or orally (under the procedures set forth in § 3.217(b)), with knowledge or notice that such information would be used to calculate benefit amounts. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(3)(i).

Individuals to whom benefits are being paid are required to certify, when requested, that any or all of the eligibility factors which established entitlement to the benefit being paid continue to exist. The beneficiary will be advised at the time of the request that the certification must be furnished within 60 days from the date of the request therefor and that failure to do so will result in the reduction or termination of benefits. If the certification is not received within 60 days from the date of the request, the eligibility factor(s) for which certification was requested will be considered to have ceased to exist as of the end of the month in which it was last shown by the evidence of record to have existed. The effective date of reduction or termination of benefits will be in accordance with §§ 3.500 through 3.504 as in effect on the date the eligibility factor(s) is considered to have ceased to exist. The claimant will be advised of the proposed reduction or termination of benefits and the date the proposed action will be effective. An additional 60 days from the date of notice of the proposed action will be provided for the claimant to respond. If the certification is not received within the additional 60-day period, the proposed reduction or termination of benefits will be put into effect. When the required certification is received, benefits will be adjusted, if necessary, in accordance with the facts found. 38 C.F.R. § 3.652.

VA will accept, for purposes of determining entitlement to benefits under laws administered by VA, the statement of a claimant as proof of marriage, dissolution of a marriage, birth of a child, or death of a dependent, provided that the statement contains: the date (month and year) and place of the event; the full name and relationship of the other person to the claimant; and the social security number of the other person. 38 U.S.C. § 5124; 38 C.F.R. § 3.204.

1. Whether the removal of the Veteran's dependent child, X., from his award of VA disability compensation effective July 1, 2014, was proper.

2. Whether the removal of the Veteran's dependent child, U., from his award of VA disability compensation effective July 1, 2014, was proper. 

3. Whether the removal of the Veteran's dependent child, S., from his award of VA disability compensation effective January 1, 2016, was proper. 

The Board has reviewed the evidence and finds that the removal of the Veteran's dependent children, X., U., and S., from his VA disability compensation award is proper. 

Regarding the procedural history of this case, in June 2014, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-686c Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, seeking to add his children, X. and U., as dependents to his award of VA disability compensation. In October 2014, the Veteran was notified that his children, X. and U., were added as dependents to his award.

In December 2015, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-686c Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, seeking to add his child, S., as a dependent to his award of VA disability compensation. In December 2015, the Veteran was notified that his child, S., was added as a dependent to his award.

In October 2022, VA sent the Veteran a letter asking that he complete the enclosed VA Form 21-0538 Status of Dependents Questionnaire, within 60 days in order to verify his ongoing eligibility for additional dependency benefits. Thereafter, there is no indication that the Veteran responded to this request.

In January 2023, because VA had not received the requested dependency information from the Veteran, VA sent the Veteran a letter advising him that his dependent children, X., U., and S., were proposed to be removed from his compensation award. The Veteran was notified that he had 60 days to submit evidence, or the proposed action would be taken.

In March 2023, having not received a response from the Veteran, VA notified the Veteran that his dependent children, X., U., and S., were removed from his award effective April 1, 2023, the date that VA last paid the Veteran additional benefits. It was further noted that if the Veteran did not verify his dependents within the following 90 days, they would be removed effective the first of the month following the date that the Veteran last verified his dependents. The Veteran was provided with a VA Form 21-686c with which to verify his dependents.

In August 2023, having not received a response from the Veteran, VA notified the Veteran that his dependent children were removed from his award as of the date that he last verified these dependents. Thus, X. was removed from the Veteran's award effective July 1, 2014, U. was removed from the Veteran's award effective July 1, 2014, and S. was removed from the Veteran's award effective January 1, 2016.

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated that he disagreed with the removal of his dependents but did not provide any of the requested information to verify his dependents.

The Board finds that the relevant procedures to remove a dependent from the Veteran's award were properly followed. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.652. Specifically, in October 2022 VA sent the Veteran correspondence to his address of record informing him that he needed to submit evidence of his ongoing eligibility to receive additional dependency compensation and that failure to do so within 60 days would result in a reduction in benefits. VA also followed the request with a proposal to reduce pursuant to provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.652(a)(1) in January 2023. VA then effectuated that reduction pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.652(a)(2) in March 2023 correspondence.

Accordingly, the Board finds no error in VA's actions in reducing the Veteran's award by removing his dependent children, X., U., and S., effective from the date that the Veteran last verified his dependents. Therefore, the appeal is denied.
