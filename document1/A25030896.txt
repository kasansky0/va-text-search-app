DOCKET NO. 210816-179399
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In January 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal was requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1987 to July 1987 and from January 1988 to May 1990.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2020 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the August 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  On January 12, 2024, the Veteran submitted written correspondence stating that he wished to withdraw this appeal and listed the docket number.  Thus, the Veteran's hearing request is also deemed withdrawn. 

Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

Appeal withdrawals must include the name of the appellant, the applicable VA file number, and statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety, or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1). Appeal withdrawals should be filed with the Board and is effective when received by the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(2)(3).

In the present case, in January 2024, the Veteran visited a Regional Office in-person to submit a VA Form 21-4138 to cancel his appeal.  It was specified that he wished to cancel his appeal for bilateral hearing loss, which was pending before the Board under docket number 210816-179399.  See January 2024 VA Form 27-0820, Report of General Information.  In the January 2024 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran requested to "'cancel any and all' open current 'Appeal Dockets' that may currently be opened on [his] behalf."  The Veteran explained that he intended to file supplemental claims and submit new evidence instead.  The Veteran stated further that he had been advised he had an open docket under docket number 210816-179399, relating to a hearing loss claim, and he wished to cancel this appeal.  

The actions and correspondence, as described above, make clear that the Veteran wishes to withdraw the appeal seeking service connection for bilateral hearing loss that is currently pending before the Board.  Accordingly, the Board finds the January 2024 statement to be a clear and unambiguous indication of an intent to withdraw the present appeal.

As there remains no allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal of this issue, and it is dismissed.  

[The Board notes parenthetically that in February 2025, the Veteran was notified by letter that a hearing for this appeal had been scheduled for April 9, 2025.  As a result of the Veteran's January 2024 withdrawal of this appeal, however, this hearing has been cancelled.  

Finally, the Board also notes that consistent with the Veteran's indicated intent in January 2024, he filed a supplemental claim in March 2024 requesting that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) review claims for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, which were addressed in a July 2023 rating decision.  However, the claims file also shows that prior to the submission of the March 2024 VA Form 20-0995, the Veteran had already appealed the July 2023 rating decision to the Board in a February 2024 VA Form 10182 and elected the Evidence Submission docket.  This appeal will be addressed by the Board in a later, separate decision.]
