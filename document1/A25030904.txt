FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had right ear hearing loss for VA compensatory purposes at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for right ear hearing loss are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active-duty military service from January 2003 to September 2003 and June 2008 to October 2008, to include additional periods in the Reserves. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes that the Veteran sought a supplemental review of the decision on appeal in April 2024 and that a decision was rendered in June 2024. The Board notes that there is no prohibition against electing multiple AMA review options so long as the elections are not concurrent. Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 25-26 (2023). 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for neck strain, a left shoulder disability, OSA, back pain, a right knee injury and pain, and gastroparesis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran is asserting that he has hearing loss due to in-service noise exposure. See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing is considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater, or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater, or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

VAMC treatment records were silent regarding the Veteran's hearing loss. A February 2024 examination report did not reveal hearing loss for VA purposes in the right ear.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence does not indicate that the Veteran has hearing loss for VA compensatory purposes in his right ear. As such, entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied. In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the evidence is not in approximate balance, the doctrine is not for application. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

2-3. Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder injury and neck strain is remanded.

The Veteran is asserting that he injured his shoulder in 2022 and that he was given a profile for his shoulder in May 2023 in the reserves. See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. He also asserts that he injured his neck "doing pushups" in September 2008. Id. No examination or medical opinion has been requested that addresses the Veteran's express contentions.

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

The evidence shows that the Veteran sought a waiver from a private clinician in October 2022 so that he would not have to perform "push-ups which aggravate his shoulder". See September 2023 Medical Treatment Record- Non-Government Facility. Service treatment records confirm that the Veteran was able to obtain a profile for his left shoulder with a May 2023 end date. See September 2023 Medical Treatment Record- Government Facility. Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence indicates that the Veteran sought private treatment for a left shoulder disability and then sought a profile for relief from reserve military duties that may harm the shoulder. However, there is no indication that the Veteran injured his left shoulder during military service in 2022 or 2023.   

However, service treatment records do affirmatively show that the Veteran sought treatment for left sided neck pain due to push-ups in September 2008 while on active duty. These records also reveal accompanying shoulder pain. 

An examination is required when (1) there is evidence of a current disability, (2) evidence establishing an "in-service event, injury or disease," or that a disease, manifested in accordance with presumptive service connection regulations, occurred which would support incurrence or aggravation, (3) an indication that the current disability may be related to the in-service event, and (4) insufficient evidence to decide the case. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

Unlike in the legacy system, the reasons for remand by the Board in the modernized review system are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors); and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). 

Here, the Board finds that it was a pre-decisional duty to assist error to deny the Veteran's claims for entitlement to service connection for a neck disability and a left shoulder disability without seeking an examination with opinion when the evidence confirmed the Veteran's assertion that he injured himself during active-duty service doing push-ups. Remand for examination and opinion is warranted. 

4. Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is remanded.

The Veteran is asserting that his diagnosed OSA is related to service in Kuwait in 2003. See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. A March 2024 VA examination report confirms a diagnosis of OSA. 

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Unlike in the legacy system, the reasons for remand by the Board in the modernized review system are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors); and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). 

Here, a March 2024 VA medical opinion indicated that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's OSA was related to a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) "after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran." The examiner cited "no medical literature to support claims that burn pits cause sleep apnea".

The Board finds that the examiner's rationale lacks specificity and is inadequate. As such, a remand for addendum opinion is warranted. 

5. Service connection for back pain is remanded.

The Veteran is asserting that his diagnosed back pain is related to service in Kuwait in 2003. See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. No examination or medical opinion has been requested that addresses the Veteran's express contention. 

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

An examination is required when (1) there is evidence of a current disability, (2) evidence establishing an "in-service event, injury or disease," or that a disease, manifested in accordance with presumptive service connection regulations, occurred which would support incurrence or aggravation, (3) an indication that the current disability may be related to the in-service event, and (4) insufficient evidence to decide the case. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

Unlike in the legacy system, the reasons for remand by the Board in the modernized review system are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors); and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). 

Here, the Board finds that the Veteran is competent to describe pain symptomatology related to an asserted back condition. As such, the Board finds that an examination with medical opinion to ascertain whether the Veteran's back pain is related to "service in Kuwait 2003" is warranted. 

6. Service connection for right knee injury and pain is remanded. 

The Veteran is asserting that he injured his right knee while pulling equipment out of a military truck during 2003 Kuwait service. See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

A veteran is presumed in sound condition except for defects, infirmities or disorders noted when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service. Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 45 (2010). To rebut the presumption of soundness, VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence both that the disease or injury existed prior to service and that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service. Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

This presumption attaches only where there has been an induction examination in which the later complained-of disability was not detected. Bagby v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 225, 227 (1991). The regulation provides that the term "noted" denotes "[o]nly such conditions as are recorded in examination reports," 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (b), and that "[h]istory of pre-service existence of conditions recorded at the time of examination does not constitute a notation of such conditions." 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (b)(1).

A veteran's lay statements concerning a preexisting condition are not sufficient to rebut the presumption of soundness. Paulson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 466, 470 (1995). Supporting medical evidence is needed to establish the presence of a preexisting condition.

Here, a March 2024 VA medical opinion indicated that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's right knee disability was incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service event. The examiner cited a preexisting injury and no contemporaneous evidence of an in-service injury. The examiner did not discuss the Veteran's assertions. Also, the examiner did not opine whether the Veteran's preexisting right knee injury was aggravated by service. 

The Board notes that the evidence of a preexisting injury stems from the Veteran's self-declaration that is memorialized in a June 2004 retention examination report. Accordingly, the Board finds that this self-declaration is not supported by medical evidence and is, therefore, insufficient to rebut the presumption of soundness. 

Unlike in the legacy system, the reasons for remand by the Board in the modernized review system are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors); and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). 

As such, the Board finds that it was erroneous to deny the Veteran's claim without obtaining an adequate opinion that considers the Veteran's express assertion that he injured his right knee while pulling equipment out of a military truck during 2003 Kuwait service. A remand for addendum opinion is warranted. 

7. Entitlement to service connection for gastroparesis, to include as secondary to GERD, is remanded.

The Veteran is asserting that he has gastroparesis that is related to service in Kuwait in 2003 and that began or worsened in 2021. See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Service connection may also be granted on a secondary basis for disability which is due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023). 

Here, a March 2024 VA medical opinion indicated that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's gastroparesis was related to a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) "after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran." The examiner explained that the Veteran's "gastric emptying" was more than likely caused by vagal nerve injury during previous non-service-connected hernia repair surgery. 

The Board notes, however, that the March 2024 VA stomach examination (history section) indicated that gastroparesis symptoms began after GERD surgery. The Veteran's GERD is service-connected.  

Unlike in the legacy system, the reasons for remand by the Board in the modernized review system are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors); and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). 

Accordingly, a remand for an adequate opinion that considers whether the Veteran's gastroparesis is related to the Veteran's service-connected GERD is warranted. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examinations for the left shoulder injury and neck strain claims. The examiner must review the claims file.

If a diagnosis cannot be provided but the Veteran's condition manifests in symptoms that cause functional impairment, then the examiner should consider them a "disability" for the purpose of providing the requested opinion(s) below.

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

Did the Veteran's left shoulder injury and neck strain claims at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) have their onset during service or are otherwise related to in-service events to include treatment for left sided neck pain to include shoulder pain due to push-ups in September 2008. 

Please cite the September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ and STRs uploaded to VBMS on November 15, 2023 (p69). 

Provide a rationale to support the opinion(s).  

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's OSA is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) caused by (the) weapons, explosives, ammunition, cleaning/maintenance chemicals, noise (gunfire, explosions, etc.), laser and burn pits after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

Please remind the examiner that they should include clear rationale that offers a more thorough explanation than "there is no medical literature to support claims that burn pits cause sleep apnea." 

Please cite September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ and March 2024 VA examination report with medical opinion. 

3. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for the Veteran's claimed back pain disorder. The examiner must review the claims file.

If a diagnosis cannot be provided but the Veteran's condition manifests in symptoms that cause functional impairment, then the examiner should consider them a "disability" for the purpose of providing the requested opinion(s) below.

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

Did the Veteran's back pain at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) have its onset during 2003 service in Kuwait, or is otherwise related to service. 

Please cite September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

Provide a rationale to support the opinion.  

4. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's right knee disability is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) caused by pulling equipment out of a military truck during 2003 Kuwait service to include complaints of knee trouble in a June 2004 Reserve/Retention examination report, or is otherwise related to service. 

Please cite September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, a June 2004 Reserve/Retention examination (p20 uploaded to VBMS on September 25, 2023), and the March 2024 VA examination report. 

Remind the examiner that the Veteran's self-declaration of a pre-service right knee injury is NOT acceptable evidence of pre-service occurrence. 

5. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's gastroparesis is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) caused by or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected GERD.

Please cite the March 2024 VA stomach examination report that indicates (in the history section) that gastroparesis symptoms began after GERD surgery and the March 2024 medical opinion.
