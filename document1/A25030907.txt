ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a partial hysterectomy (claimed as retroverted tilted uterus) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran's partial hysterectomy is related to active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a partial hysterectomy (claimed as retroverted tilted uterus) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1992 to July 1996.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for partial hysterectomy (claimed as retroverted tilted uterus)

The Veteran contends that she suffers from a retroverted tilted uterus that is related to a Caesarean section performed during active service. Specifically, she contends that her uterus was put back inside of her upside down, which caused painful intercourse, irregular periods, and panic attacks. See February 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim. She further contends that this resulted in "fiber cyst" embedded in her uterus, heavy bleeding, and a partial hysterectomy at age 44. Id.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See, e.g., Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

As to the first requirement of a current disability, the Veteran's VA treatment records, as well as a March 2023 VA examination confirm that the Veteran underwent a partial hysterectomy in 2019. See CAPRI, record dated January 8, 2019. Accordingly, the first requirement for service connection has been met.

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records confirm that she underwent a C-section during service in October 1994 due to a primary herpes lesion of the perineum. Accordingly, to the extent that the Veteran's theory of entitlement is based on an in-service C-section, the second requirement of an in-service incurrence has also been met.

The remaining determination for the Board is whether the Veteran's partial hysterectomy was related to her in-service C-section.

In multiple entries in the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs), the Veteran's in-service C-section was described as being completed with no complications. At the time of the Veteran's June 1996 separation examination (approximately 20 months after the C-section), the Veteran did not report, neither did the examining physician note, any complications with the Veteran's childbirth or any current gynecological abnormalities.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2023. While the examiner noted the Veteran's in-service C-section and partial hysterectomy in 2019, the examiner concluded that the Veteran did not have symptoms related to a gynecological condition, including any diseases, injuries, or adhesions of the female reproductive organs. The examiner indicated that the Veteran also did not require treatment for any such symptoms. Ultimately, the examiner opined that there were no findings, signs, and or symptoms to support a diagnosis of any gynecological condition. 

An addendum medical opinion was obtained in March 2024 which also confirmed the above findings. The examiner noted that there was no evidence of post-op complications from the Veteran's in-service C-section. The examiner added that the Veteran established care for recurrent vaginitis in 2007, that she was found to have two large fibroids in 2008, and that she was offered an ablation in the same year, but that she declined. The examiner explained symptoms and common treatment options for fibroids, and noted that the Veteran ultimately underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and diagnostic cystoscopy for treatment of uterus with multiple leiomyomas. There was no indication that the Veteran had a current disability, or residuals related to the uterus. The examiner opined that that the Veteran's hysterectomy was not related to active service.

The Board finds that the March 2024 examiner's opinion is highly probative, as it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). Moreover, there is no other medical opinion of record to refute the examiner's findings.

While the Board has considered the Veteran's contentions that her condition is related to service, she is not competent to provide a nexus opinion in this case. The issue is medically complex, and falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

The Board finds that the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's partial hysterectomy (claimed as retroverted tilted uterus) is related to service, and therefore, the claim must be denied.
