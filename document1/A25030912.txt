ORDER

A total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service connected disabilities since May 15, 2019, but no earlier, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's claim for a TDIU has been pending since she filed her intent to file a claim (ITF) for service connected for an acquired psychiatric disorder on July 31, 2018; the evidence shows that effective May 15, 2019, she was unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment as a result of her service-connected disabilities. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

From May 15, 2019 to October 21, 2021, but no earlier, the criteria for entitlement to a?TDIU have been met.? 38?U.S.C. §§?1155, 5101, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.1(p); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.151, 4.16. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1994 to January 1998, and from July 2006 to July 2006.

This appeal comes from an April 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision.? See VA Form 10182 AMA Notices of Disagreement (Direct Review Lane) received April 2024.? Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AMA decision on appeal.? 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Entitlement to an?effective?date prior to October 21, 2021,                                          for the award of a?TDIU.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date than October 21, 2021 for the award of a TDIU.  

The Veteran submitted an ITF on July 31, 2018, followed by a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, in November 2018 claiming service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, a headache disorder and bilateral shoulder disability.   

A rating decision in May 2019, granted service connection for a mental health disability, evaluated as 70 percent disabling, effective July 31, 2018, the date the Veteran submitted an ITF.  That rating decision also granted service connection for migraine headaches, evaluated as 30 percent disabling, and bilateral shoulder disabilities, separately rated as 20 percent disabling, also effective July 21, 2018.  

In April 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, seeking earlier effective dates for the grant of service connection for a psychiatric disorder, migraine headaches and bilateral shoulder disabilities, as well as higher disability ratings than those assigned.  

A rating decision in September 2020, denied the Veteran's claims for earlier effective dates for the grant of service connection for a psychiatric disorder, migraine headaches and bilateral shoulder disabilities.  It also denied the claims for higher ratings.  

In September 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 AMA Notice of Disagreement (NOD) disagreeing with the September 2020 rating decision.  

On October 21, 2021 the Veteran submitted a completed VA Form 21-8940, Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.

In April 2022, the Board issued a decision that, in pertinent part, remanded the issue of entitlement to a TDIU for additional development, as well as the claims for increased ratings for a psychiatric disorder, bilateral shoulder disabilities and migraine headaches. 

During the pendency of the appeal, a June 2023 rating decision granted entitlement to a TDIU effective October 21, 2021.  

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-0995 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, seeking an earlier effective date for the award of a TDIU.  

In a rating decision in November 2023, the Veteran's claim for an effective date earlier than October 21, 2021, for the award of entitlement to a TDIU was denied.  

In April 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, seeking earlier effective dates for the award of a TDIU.  The claim was denied in April 2024, followed by a timely NOD, and the current appeal ensued.  

Therefore, the evidence shows that the claims for increased ratings for a psychiatric disorder, migraine headaches and bilateral shoulder disabilities, have been continuously pursued since July 31, 2018, the date of the ITF.  

A TDIU claim is a component of an increased rating claim.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22?Vet. App.?447 (2009).  Accordingly, as a Rice claim for TDIU must be considered in conjunction with the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder, for the period from July 31, 2018, the date of claim, through October 21, 2021, the date TDIU benefits were granted. 

The Veteran indicated that she last worked in April 2019 for VA.  She asserts that since 2018 she had to go out on Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) due to her service-connected disabilities and believes she should be granted a TDIU for the entire period in question, since July 2018.   

In terms of the date entitlement arose, TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38?C.F.R. §§?3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a). 

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components.  See Ray v. Wilkie,?31?Vet. App.?58, 73?(2019).  The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than?marginal?income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person.?Id.? The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment.?Id.? Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity).?Id.? 

While VA has not defined the term "protected environment" in the regulations governing TDIU claims, the applicable VA regulations suggest that a protected environment includes a family business or sheltered workshop.  Factors to consider may also include the "magnitude of the veteran's job responsibilities and the degree of accommodation necessary for successful, full-time work."  Cantrell v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 382, 392 (2017).

Where a veteran's disabilities do not result in lost income or where legally required accommodations permit a veteran to maintain gainful employment, an award of TDIU does not serve its intended purpose.  Cantrell v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 382, 396 (2017) (Lance, J., concurring) ("Where a claimant's employer is required by law to provide reasonable accommodations pursuant to the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)] and those accommodations allow the claimant to engage in a substantially gainful occupation, a TDIU award would, in effect, constitute a second paycheck on the back of the taxpayer.").

An award of?TDIU?is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training.  See Todd v. McDonald,?27?Vet. App.?79, 85?(2014).  It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability.  Roberson v. Principi,?251 F.3d 1378, 1385?(Fed. Cir. 2001).  The ultimate question is whether they are capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown,?4?Vet. App.?361, 363?(1993). 

For the period from July 31, 2018, the date of claim, through October 21, 2021, for: 

"	An acquired psychiatric disorder, evaluated as 70 % disabled; 

"	Migraine headaches, evaluated as 30 % disabled; 

"	A right shoulder disability, evaluated as 20 % disabled; 

"	A left shoulder disability, evaluated as 20 % disabled; and, 

"	Sinusitis, evaluated as 0 % disabled, effective June 7, 2019.

Therefore, the Veteran's combined disability evaluation was 90%.  Accordingly, the schedular criteria for TDIU were met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16. 

What remains is a determination that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, including her acquired psychiatric disorder and migraine headaches, rendered her totally unemployable from July 31, 2018. 

On VA examination Mental Disorders in March 2019, the Veteran reported that she had been employed at a VA Medical Center for the last five years.  At the time of the examination, she indicated that she had been on FMLA for the last couple of months following impatient treatment for mental health problems.  She reported having struggled with extreme anxiety leading up to her hospitalization.  She was having panic attacks at work and had to leave work a couple of times because of these episodes.  The Veteran indicated that she was missing a lot of time form work.  She stated she was fired while out on FMLA, but she contacted the union who helped her get her job back.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were productive of occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in March 2019 to evaluate his bilateral shoulder disabilities.  The examiner opined that the Veteran was unable to lift weight or raise the right upper extremity due to shoulder pain.

On VA headaches examination in March 2019, the Veteran reported monthly headaches that rendered her incapable of performing daily activities due to the intensity of the pain and nausea.  The examiner noted prostrating headaches more frequently than once per month, productive of decreased focus or concentration due to the intensity of the pain and nausea, which required her to lay down in dark room.  

On VA sinusitis/rhinitis examination in February 2020, the Veteran reported that she was unemployed.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's sinusitis resulted in two to four weeks of work time lost in last 12 months, due to headaches and nasal symptoms that distracted and interfered with focus and productivity. 

A private psychologist in July 2021, found that due to the Veteran's mental health she would miss or leave work three or more days per month.  The clinician determined that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were productive of occupational and social impairment is best summarized with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood.  The examiner noted that the Veteran experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, panic attacks, sleep impairment, memory loss, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, suicidal ideation, and obsessional rituals that interfered with routine activities.  The clinician opined that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms more likely than not prevented her from maintaining substantially gainful employment since July 2018.  

In September 2021, following a review of the claims file, a private vocational consultant opined that the Veteran was totally occupationally disabled from all competitive employment due to her service-connected psychiatric disorder, migraine headaches, left shoulder strain, right shoulder rotator cuff tear and sinusitis, since April 2019.

On her October 21, 2021 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported that she was last employed full time as a mental health technician in April 2019.   

In support of her claim, the Veteran submitted a Social Security statement regarding her earnings record that showed the following annual earnings; $41,094 for 2018, $17,148 for 2018, and $7,105 for 2019.  The Veteran reported that her 2019 earnings were from FMLA.  

Verification of the Veteran's employment was received from Office of Personnel Management in May 2023, her former employer, which verified that the Veteran's last date of employment was May 15, 2019, the date her resignation became effective.  The report noted that she was a full-time salaried employee until May 15, 2019.  The reason for her resignation was inability to perform her work duties due to health reasons that were beyond her control.  It was noted that she had exhausted all FMLA hours.  The records show that from April 2018 to April 2019, the Veteran was intermittently absent from work and took FMLA.  

Here the evidence shows that the Veteran was last employed on a fulltime basis until May 15, 2019, when she resigned from her employment.  

Read in the light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds that, for the period from May 15, 2019 through October 21, 2021, the most persuasive evidence shows?that, the combination of the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disorder and physical disabilities, with consideration of her employment history and educational background, would more likely than not precluded her from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation.? See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995); also see Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 Fed. Cir. 2013); Lynch v. West, 178 F.3d 1312 (Fed. Cir. 1998). 

Specifically, her psychiatric disorder which was manifested by moderately severe symptoms, including panic attacks and high anxiety at work, and was productive of occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood.  In addition to her migraine headaches, which was manifested by prostrating attacks more than once a month.  

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of May 15, 2019 for the award of a TDIU is warranted.  

Prior to May 15, 2019, the Veteran's employment was not with a family business, nor was there evidence showing that the Veteran was provided with accommodations in order to support her continued employment.  While the Veteran used leave when she felt her symptoms warranted it, this is a benefit provided by her employer and not an accomodation.  The Veteran also reported being on FMLA intermittently.  Leave under the FMLA is a protection provided to all employees by law, and there is no evidence that her use of FMLA on an as needed basis was an accommodation that was extraordinary or beyond that which would be required by the ADA; therefore, the use of FMLA is not an accommodation in itself which would warrant an award of a TDIU.  

As noted, the Veteran maintained fulltime employment status through May 15, 2019, despite any functional loss or impairment associated with her service-connected disabilities.

As such, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's employment from July 31, 2018 to May 15, 2019 was marginal.

The Board acknowledges that as a result of her service connected disabilities the Veteran may not have earned as much income in 2018 and prior to May 15, 2019, as she had during the preceding years and that she had many problems.  The Board observes that the disability ratings assigned throughout the relevant period on appeal, recognize that the impairment due to her service-connected disabilities made it difficult to obtain and keep employment (that the Veteran had problems is not in dispute).  What she has indicated are the problems a Veteran would have with a disability of 90 percent.  If the Veteran did not have problems with her service-connected disabilities, there would be no basis for the combined disability rating of 90 percent (which, it is important for the Veteran to understand, will cause her many problems) which in effect aims to compensate for the reduction in workability caused by her service connected disabilities.

In sum, the Board finds that May 15, 2019, but no earlier, is the proper effective date for the award of the Veteran's TDIU pursuant to Rice, and this earlier effective date is granted.  38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102.
