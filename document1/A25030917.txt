DOCKET NO. 210621-167383
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 30, 2008, for the grant of service connection for a head scar, is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The appellant filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) in June 2021.  However, the NOD was unclear as to the issues or decision the appellant wished to appeal.

2. In November 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sent the appellant a letter informing the appellant that the Board interpreted the June 2021 NOD as an appeal of a March 2019 rating decision, and that he had an opportunity to clarify the issue and decision he wished to appeal.  The appellant did not respond to the November 2024 clarification letter. 

3. The June 2021 VA Form 10182, NOD, was received more than a year after the March 2019 rating decision; therefore, the filing is untimely.  No good cause has been shown that would permit the Board to extend the filing period and the Board did not waive (implicitly or explicitly) the timeliness of a VA Form 10182.

4. The March 2019 rating decision was an implemented final decision by the Board. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to an effective date prior to May 30, 2008, for the grant of service connection for a head scar, are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109, 3.2400, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The appellant served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1997 to October 1999.

Procedural History

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a March 2019 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), which implemented the Board's March 2019 decision awarding an effective date of May 30, 2008, for the grant of service connection for a head scar.   

The appellant's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), was received by VA in June 2021.  The appellant elected the Direct Review Docket.

Evidentiary Windows

As the appellant has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issues on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.  The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182).  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The appellant has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it.  If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Dismissal of Appeal

Here, the appellant filed a June 2021 NOD that was unclear as to the issues or decision the appellant wished to appeal.  The Board sent the appellant a notification letter in November 2024 seeking clarification of the issues the appellant wished to appeal.  The Board specifically informed the appellant its interpretation of the June 2021 NOD.  The Board indicated that based on the documents submitted with the June 2021 NOD, the Board interpreted the appellant's NOD as noting disagreement with the March 2019 rating decision with respect to the issue of entitlement to an effective date prior to May 30, 2008, for the grant of service connection for a head scar.  See Board Notification Letter, November 26, 2024.  The Board further informed the appellant that the June 2021 NOD was received more than a year after the issuance of the March 2019 rating decision, and thus untimely, and that the March 2019 rating decision was an implementing decision that is not appealable to the Board.  Id.  The Board informed the appellant that he should clarify the issue he sought to appeal within 60 days of the notice letter, or the Board would proceed to review the appeal of the issue under the Board's noted interpretation.  Id.  

To date, the appellant has not responded to the Board's November 2024 notice letter.  The duty to assist is not always a one-way street.  If a veteran wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining the putative evidence.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).  As the appellant has not provided further information regarding the issue he wished to appeal, the Board will proceed with interpreting the June 2021 NOD as noting disagreement with the March 2019 rating decision.  

In this case, the June 2021 NOD is an untimely appeal of the March 2019 rating decision as stipulated in the November 2024 notice letter.  Although the Board may not dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction due to an untimely VA Form 21-0958, Notice of Disagreement (as to legacy-era rating decisions), an untimely VA Form 10182 (as to Appeals Modernization Act (AMA)-era rating decisions), or submission of the incorrect form to appeal a given rating decision (e.g., submission of VA Form 21-0958 to appeal an AMA-era rating decision), it may dismiss the appeal due to non-jurisdictional reasons, such as a procedural defect, where the claimant did not substantially comply with proper claims processing rules.  See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (stating VA can require a claimant to fill out a particular form and can dismiss nonconforming or untimely filings, but a failure to follow claims processing rules does not affect the Board's jurisdiction); see also Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021).  

As such, the June 2021 NOD did not comply with the claims processing rules as to timeliness.  The April 2019 Notification Letter clearly stated that the appellant had one year from the date of that letter to elect an appropriate review option of the decision and enclosed a VA Form 20-0998, which explained his review options.  See VA Notification Letter, April 8, 2019.  Thus, the June 2021 VA Form 10182 was not timely submitted with respect to the March 2019 rating decision.

The Board has considered the applicability of any waiver that would permit extending the filing period but finds no such evidence.  See, generally, Ferko, at *12-13; Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 332 (regulatory claims-processing rules may be waived without affecting jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal); Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 45 (2009) (VA may implicitly or explicitly waive any issue of timeliness in the filing of a Substantive Appeal).

The appellant did not file a motion for an extension and has not provided good cause to extend the filing period, and no other arguable waiver is applicable here.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) (Time limits within which claimants or beneficiaries are required to act to perfect a claim or challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended for good cause shown.); 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c) ("An extension of the period for filing a Notice of Disagreement or a request to modify a Notice of Disagreement may be granted for good cause.  A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board.").  At the time of the March 2019 rating decision, the appellant was provided notice of the decision with instructions on how to select the appropriate review options for the decision, if he so chose.  See VA Notification Letter, April 8, 2019.  Thus, the evidence of record supports a finding that the appellant was adequately informed of how and by when to appeal the March 2019 rating decision.

Whether the Board waived any procedural defects by virtue of docketing the AMA appeal has been considered.  See, e.g., Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 46-47 (2009) (holding VA waived any objection to the timeliness of the legacy substantive appeal because "VA consistently treated the matter as if it was part of the timely filed Substantive Appeal" for over five years.").  The appellant filed his VA Form 10182 on June 21, 2021.  The Board sent a letter in June 2021 acknowledging receipt of the appellant's VA Form 10182 and placement of the appeal on the Direct Review Docket.  This letter acknowledging receipt and the mere administrative act of assigning the attempted appeal a docket, in and of itself, does not constitute a waiver of procedural defects.  Indeed, whether the Board has waived any objection to the procedural defects of a VA Form 10182 should be based on all facts and circumstances of that case.  See Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46 (discussing VA's actions in that case in finding VA had treated the substantive appeal as timely filed).  Although the appeal was docketed as an automatic administrative action, unlike the circumstances of Percy, the Board did not continuously "engage in substantive and procedural development" of the appeal.  There is no action in which the appellant would be under the impression that the merits of the case were examined and being developed in any substantive way.  The Board's notice of receipt of the appellant's purported appeal did not convey any intent to forgo reliance on the laws applicable to docketing.  Thus, the facts herein are distinguishable from Percy, and it is found that the mere sending of the docketing letter did not constitute a waiver of any procedural defects regarding the appellant's June 2021 VA Form 10182.

Moreover, based on the interpretation of the June 2021 NOD being an appeal of the March 2019 rating decision that implemented the Board's March 2019 decision with the claim at issue, the docketing of this appeal was in error as the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has clarified that implementing rating decisions are not appealable to the Board and appeals of such decisions must be dismissed.  See Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (U.S. 2023).  Accordingly, the appellant's appeal of the March 2019 rating decision on the issue of entitlement to an effective date prior to May 30, 2008, for the grant of service connection for a head scar, is dismissed.
