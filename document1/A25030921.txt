ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a gynecological condition to include fibroids, cysts, and hysterectomy with removal of ovaries ("gynecological condition") is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding the gynecological condition is related to service, including in-service exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a gynecological condition have not been met.  38 U.S.C.§§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R.§§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 4.3.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps from January 1984 to May 1985.  She was awarded the Good Conduct Medal for her service.

Applicable Evidentiary Window

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  Therefore, this matter is adjudicated under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review Docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R.§ 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the March 2024 rating decision cannot be considered by the Board.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, or if the Veteran would like to submit any new and relevant evidence, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection Generally

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from personal injury or disease contracted, incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R.§ 3.303.  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d); see also Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043(Fed. Cir. 1994).

Generally, to establish service connection on a direct basis, the record must contain competent evidence of (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  See 38 C.F.R.§ 3.303; Shedden v. Principi, 381, F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for certain diseases associated with exposure to specific contaminants found in the water supply at Camp Lejeune, defined as volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PRE or PERC), benzene, and vinyl chloride, for qualified Veterans.  To establish such presumptive service connection, the Veteran must show: (1) that she has qualified active service at Camp Lejeune on the specified dates; (2) that she is diagnosed with a disease associated with exposure to the defined contaminant; and (3) that the current disease process manifested within the prescribed times set out in section 38 C.F.R. § 3.307.  See 38 C.F.R.§§ 3.307(a)(7), 3.309(f).  If the claimed disability is not a listed disease in 38 C.F.R.§ 3.309(f), then a nexus must be established between the claimed disability and the in-service exposure.

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.  A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77.

The Board is charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence.  See Madden v. Gober, 125 F. 3d. 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 363 (2001).  In Jefferson v. Principi, 271 F.3d 1072 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the Federal Circuit Court, citing its decision in Madden, recognized that the Board held inherent fact-finding ability.  Id. at 1076; see also 38 U.S.C.§ 7104(a).  Further the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to weigh and assess the evidence.  See Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482 (2000); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614 (1992).

When there is approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  See 38 U.S.C.§ 5107; 38 C.F.R.§§ 3.102, 4.3.  When a Veteran seeks benefits and the evidence is in approximate balance (equipoise), the Veteran prevails.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  The benefit of the doubt rule does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board has reviewed the evidence in the claims file, with an emphasis on the evidence pertinent to the issues on appeal.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss in detail, all contents of the extensive evidence of record.  See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  Therefore, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim.

Service connection for a gynecological condition is denied.

The Veteran contends that she was exposed to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune during service and her gynecological condition was due to this exposure.  See November 2022, Lay Statement.  In support of her claim, the Veteran submitted several lay witness statements from friends and family, and research articles and reports regarding the Camp Lejeune water supply contamination.  See December 2022 Medical Research Articles; November 2022, Site Information; November 2022 Lay statement and Correspondence; July 2015 Contamination Synopsis; July 2015 Report of ATSDR Summary and Findings; July 2014 Lay Witness Statement of L.S.; July 2014 Lay Witness Statement of M.W.; July 2014 Lay Witness Statement of G.W.; July 2014 Lay Witness Statement of G.M.

In the March 2024 rating decision, the RO made favorable findings of (1) a current disability based on the January 2023 diagnosis of uterine adenomyosis and uterine fibroids, resulting in a total hysterectomy with left salpingo-oophorectomy, rendering infertility, and (2) qualified presumptive exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune during her active service.  See March 2024 Rating Decision.  These favorable findings are binding on the board, absent clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The Board notes that the Veteran's service records are silent for gynecological conditions, but do note the Veteran requested and was granted a discharge from service due to a pregnancy.  Therefore, the issues for determination by the Board are whether presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R.§ 3.307(a)(7) is warranted, and if not, whether a causal connection between the gynecological condition and the conceded contaminant exposure at Camp Lejeune is established for direct service connection.  

The Board initially considered presumptive service connection, since exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune was conceded. However, the Veteran's uterine adenomyosis and uterine fibroids are not conditions presumed to be associated with contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.  Accordingly, presumptive service connection cannot be granted.  See 38 C.F.R.§ 3.309(f).

The Board must also consider whether direct service connection may be established.  Here, the evidence of record must show a nexus between the Veteran's gynecological condition and her exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune during service.  The Board acknowledges the detailed and credible statements documenting and substantiating the Veteran's symptoms and complaints associated with her medical condition and disability; however, lay persons are not competent to determine the etiology of the Veteran's gynecological condition.  Such a causation determination requires expert knowledge and training, as well as expertise and experience with analyzing and understanding contaminant exposure, such as that encountered at Camp Lejeune.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).

Turning now to the medical and expert witness evidence of record, the Veteran requested and obtained a nexus statement from a VA Family Nurse Practitioner, L. C.  The VA clinician reported that there is "reason to believe" that the exposure to contaminants at Camp Lejeune "could most likely" have resulted in her gynecological condition.  See March 2024, VA Medical Treatment Records.  The VA Clinician explained that various contaminants (including those at Camp Lejeune) are classified as endocrine disruptors which affect hormone receptors, which in turn can cause uterine fibroids.  Consequently, the Veteran required a hysterectomy for stabilization and relief of pain and discomfort.  The VA clinician concluded by stating that there is a positive relationship between the uterine fibroids and the exposure to toxins in the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.  See March 2024, VA Medical Treatment records.  The Board finds the VA clinician's opinion equivocal and speculative.  The probative value is very minimal since the VA clinician merely states that there is reason to "believe" that exposure "could" be the cause of fibroids and that there is some "positive" causal relationship.  See Polovick v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 48 (2009) ("may well be" was speculative without analysis of medical studies, other risk factors, and manner of manifestation); Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185 (1999) ("could" without additional rationale or supporting data is speculative); Hood v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 295 (2009) (the equivocal nature of an opinion signals that opinion is speculative and of little probative value).  Further, the VA clinician failed to explain the significance of medical literature or studies regarding this Veteran's particular exposure and the studies relevant to Camp Lejeune.  The VA clinician did not discuss the risk factors relevant to this Veteran or explain the significance of how her condition manifested or the timing of the onset of her gynecological condition.  Therefore, the Board finds this opinion insufficient to establish the requisite nexus for service connection.  See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97 (2012); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007).

VA obtained a Medical Opinion DBQ in January 2023. The VA clinician opined that the claimed gynecological condition and removal of ovaries was less likely than not (less than 50 percent probability) incurred in or caused by the exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune during service.  The VA clinician reviewed the Veteran's medical history, medical records, literature on toxicological data regarding the water contamination at Camp Lejeune, exposure time (estimated at 98 days), and health outcome studies of the Camp Lejeune veterans.  The VA clinician reviewed the opinion from the FNP and considered the medical articles submitted by the Veteran.  The VA clinician noted that the studies regarding female infertility or miscarriage based on Camp Lejeune exposure involved symptoms at the time of exposure.  The medical rationale included an assessment of the Veteran's risk factors from her family history, occupational history, pre- and post- service experiences, and other relevant history.  As well, the medical rationale of the January 2023 VA clinician explained the history of the Veteran's condition and explanation of its manifestation.  The VA clinician noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with adenomyosis and fibroids, and that there is insufficient scientific evidence that Camp Lejeune contaminated water exposure causes either adenomyosis or fibroids.  The VA clinician explained that the FNP opinion relied on a causal role between the contaminant exposure and endocrine effects.  However, in this case, the Veteran had adenomyosis and fibroids, for which no causal role of the Camp Lejeune toxins has been established.  Further, the Veteran's infertility was from a hysterectomy due to severe fibroids and did not come about at the time of or due to her exposure.  The Board finds the January 2023 VA medical opinion adequate and probative.  The VA clinician provided an explanatory and complete rationale for the opinion.  He referenced not only the medical records, but also the available medical and scientific research and literature, including an explanation of how the studies are relevant to this Veteran's exposure at Camp Lejeune.  Therefore, the Board gives this medical opinion significant weight.  See Monzingo v. Shinseki, supra; Stefl v. Nicholson, supra.

There is insufficient medical evidence to establish that the gynecological condition is causally related to the Veteran's exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune.  Therefore, the Board concludes that the competent and probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's gynecological condition was incurred in service, aggravated in service, or otherwise shown to be related to her service, including any exposure to contaminants through the water at Camp Lejeune.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply.  See 38 U.S.C.§ 5107(b); see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to service connection of gynecological condition, to include fibroids, cysts, and hysterectomy with removal of ovaries, is not warranted.  The appeal is denied.
