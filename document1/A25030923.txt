REMANDED

Entitlement to clothing allowances for calendar year 2020 is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from July 1996 to February 2005.

In the December 21, 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Representative

The Veteran was previously represented by attorney Ralph Bratch. In September 2022, the Veteran attempted to update his representation to the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) by submitting a new VA Form 21-22. Although the Veteran signed and dated the form, the form was not signed and dated by a representative. Accordingly, on September 21, 2022, VA sent the Veteran a letter informing him his September 2022 VA Form 21-22 was incomplete and could not be processed and requested that he submit a completed form. The Veteran did not respond to this request, and he is currently continuing this appeal unrepresented/pro se. If the Veteran would like to obtain representation, then he needs to complete a VA Form 21-22. He can also reach out to a representative, such as DAV, to help navigate completing VA forms. 

Entitlement to clothing allowances for calendar year 2020 is remanded.

On his December 2020 VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated that his claims clothing allowances for calendar year 2020, for bilateral hand splints and bilateral knee braces, were denied in an October 2020 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) decision. The Veteran is service connected for left- and right-hand cold weather injury residuals and carpal tunnel syndrome, left knee instability, left knee patellofemoral syndrome, and right knee tendonitis with patellofemoral pain syndrome. 

Unfortunately, the Board finds that remand is necessary to obtain a copy of the complete record before the AOJ at the time the decision on appeal was rendered. Decisions of the Board must be based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal, and any additional evidence considered as part of the evidentiary record pursuant to applicable statute and regulation. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (d), 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

Here, the electronic record does not include the decision on appeal, any notice provided to the Veteran, the claim for benefits, or any medical or lay records that VHA relied upon in its determination. Remand is necessary to obtain all relevant evidence. Without the AOJ decision on appeal, the Board cannot determine the basis of the denial, the laws under which the claim was denied, any AOJ findings favorable to the appellant, or what evidence was considered, all of which are required to be in a decision of the AOJ. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 511 (a), 5104(b). If a copy of the decision being appealed cannot be associated with the claim file, the Veteran must be provided with notice of the decision that explains the basis of any denial of benefits, and a copy of this must be associated with the claim file.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain and associate with the Veteran's electronic file: the Veteran's 2020 clothing allowance claim, the original decision denying entitlement to clothing allowances for year 2020, notice provided to the Veteran of the decision on appeal as described in 38 U.S.C. §5104 (b), and any medical or lay evidence relied upon in rendering the decision.
