ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for surgical scars, left ankle associated with chronic left ankle sprain, status post reconstruction, is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for painful scar, left ankle associated with chronic left ankle sprain, status post reconstruction, is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for chronic left ankle sprain, status post reconstruction ("left ankle disability") is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's left ankle (non-painful) scar does not cover an area of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.

2. The Veteran does not have more than two scars of the left ankle that are painful or unstable.

3. The Veteran's left ankle disability has not manifested to marked limited motion of the ankle, defined as less than 5 degrees in dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees in plantar flexion.

4. The Veteran's hearing loss did not manifest hearing acuity worse than Level II hearing impairment in the right ear and Level II hearing impairment in the left ear which equates to a noncompensable rating.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable rating for surgical scars, left ankle associated with chronic left ankle sprain, status post reconstruction have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 7805, 7800-7804.

2. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for painful scar, left ankle associated with chronic left ankle sprain, status post reconstruction have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 7804.

3. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for left ankle disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.

4. The criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from September 1978 to December 1981 and from March 1982 to June 1997.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 higher-level review rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), also known as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which adjudicated the Veteran's request for higher-level review of a prior March 2023 rating decision.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision on appeal, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the VA Schedule for Ratings Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38. C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995). Where, as here, the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the medical evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of the assignment of different ratings for distinct periods of time, based on the facts found is required. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, (2007).

If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  A disability may require re-evaluation in accordance with changes in a veteran's condition.  It is thus essential, in determining the level of current impairment, that the disability be considered in the context of the entire recorded history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint." 

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

1. Entitlement to a compensable rating for surgical scars, left ankle associated with chronic left ankle sprain, status post reconstruction, is denied.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for painful scar, left ankle associated with chronic left ankle sprain, status post reconstruction, is denied.

The Veteran asserts that his left ankle scars warrant ratings higher than those currently assigned.  See March 2024 NOD.

The Veteran's service-connected left foot scars have been rated under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7804 (painful) and 7805 (non-painful).

Under DC 7804, scar(s), unstable or painful, warrant a rating of 10 percent for one or two scars that are unstable or painful; 20 percent for three or four scars that are unstable or painful; and a maximum rating of 30 percent for five or more scars that are unstable or painful. 

Note (1) provides that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. 

Note (2) provides that if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. 

Note (3) provides that scars evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under this Diagnostic Code, when applicable. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804.

Diagnostic Code 7805 instructs to evaluate any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under DC 7800-04 under an appropriate Diagnostic Code.  Here, the AOJ assigned a non-compensable rating under DC 7802, applicable to burn scars or scars due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. 

Under DC 7802, a 10 percent rating is warranted where there is an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his scar/disfigurement conditions in February 2023.  The Veteran was diagnosed with two scars of the left ankle.  The examiner found that the Veteran's scars are not painful, unstable, or related to burns.  The examiner found that the Veteran's first scar measured 9.8 centimeters by 0.2 centimeters, and the second measured 1.2 centimeters by 0.1 centimeters.  The examiner further found that the Veteran's scars do not result in any functional impact for the Veteran.

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the probative evidence does not support a compensable rating for the Veteran's left ankle non-painful scar or a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's left ankle painful scar.  The Board finds that the February 2023 VA examination is the most probative evidence of record.  Neither the February 2023 VA examination nor any of the Veteran's VA or private treatment records indicate that the Veteran has more than two painful scars under DC 7804, or that the Veteran's scar covers an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.

Moreover, the Veteran does not assert that the February 2023 VA examiner's findings with respect to his left ankle scars were inaccurate. He has not identified any other evidence that would support a higher rating for his service-connected left ankle scars. The Board finds no such evidence in the record, including in prior VA examinations or medical records for the period on appeal.

The Board has considered the Veteran's statements regarding the severity of his disability.  However, as a lay person, the Veteran does not have the training or expertise to render a competent opinion which is more probative than the VA examiner's opinion on this issue, as this is a medical determination that is complex. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994)). Thus, the lay opinions by themselves are outweighed by the VA examiners' findings. See id.; see also King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (affirming the Court's conclusion that the Board did not improperly discount the weight of a lay opinion in finding a medical expert's opinion more probative on the issue of medical causation).

As the evidence is persuasively against assigning a compensable rating for the Veteran's left ankle non-painful scar, or a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's left ankle painful scar, there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021).  Accordingly, entitlement to an increased rating for these claims is denied.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for chronic left ankle sprain, status post reconstruction is denied.

The Veteran contends that his service-connected left ankle disability warrants an increased rating.  See March 2024 NOD.

The Veteran's left ankle disability has been rated under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5271.

Under DC 5271, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle, defined as less than 15 degrees in dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees in plantar flexion. A maximum 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle, defined as less than 5 degrees in dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees in plantar flexion.

The normal ranges of motion of the ankle are 20 degrees of dorsiflexion and 45 degrees of plantar flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his ankle conditions in February 2023. The Veteran was diagnosed with chronic left ankle strain, status post reconstruction. The Veteran reported an onset of symptoms in 1987 which have gotten worse with time, with current symptoms consisting of numbness, constant pain and knee pain from ankle, which he treats with medication, specifically 800 mg of Motrin on an as needed basis.  The Veteran did not report flare-ups of the left ankle but reported functional limitations in that he is unable to walk for long distances.  On physical examination, range of motion (ROM) testing measured 40 degrees plantar flexion and 15 degrees dorsiflexion with pain noted on active motion and passive motion which does not cause functional loss, and objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue.  The examiner found that there is no evidence of crepitus.  ROM testing after repeated use over time measured 35 degrees plantar flexion and 10 degrees dorsiflexion.  The examiner found that pain, weakness, fatigability, and incoordination, do not significantly limit his functional ability with repeated use over time. The Veteran had no signs of muscle atrophy and no signs of ankylosis or malunion or nonunion. The examiner found that the Veteran does not use an assistive device and that his ankle condition would impact his employability in that he has difficulties with prolonged walking.

The Board has also carefully reviewed the Veteran's VA and private treatment records which are generally silent for any information pertinent to the Veteran's left ankle symptoms during the period on appeal, with the exception of generally noting his left ankle pain.  See March 2024 VAMC treatment records (Veteran's active problems include pain of left ankle joint).

After carefully considering the foregoing evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's left ankle disability does not warrant a higher rating. The Board finds that the February 2023 VA examination is the most probative evidence of record, and neither this VA examination, nor the Veteran's VA or private treatment records, supports that the Veteran's left ankle disability manifested to marked limited motion of the ankle, defined as less than 5 degrees in dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees in plantar flexion.

The Veteran does not assert that the February 2023 VA examiner's findings were inaccurate. The Board finds that the findings are probative as the examiner is a medical professional that physically examined the Veteran. The Veteran has not identified any other evidence that would support higher rating for his service-connected left ankle disability. The Board finds no such evidence in the record, including in prior VA examinations or medical records for the period on appeal.

The Board has considered the Veteran's statements regarding the severity of his disability. However, as a lay person, the Veteran does not have the training or expertise to render a competent opinion which is more probative than the VA examiners' opinions on this issue, as this is a medical determination that is complex. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994)). Thus, the lay opinions by themselves are outweighed by the VA examiners' findings. See id.; see also King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (affirming the Court's conclusion that the Board did not improperly discount the weight of a lay opinion in finding a medical expert's opinion more probative on the issue of medical causation).

The Board has also considered Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, which held that when evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities where the relevant diagnostic code does not reference medication use, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects and evaluate the baseline severity of each disability. Here, the Veteran reported at the VA examination that he treated his left ankle with medication, specifically 800 mg of Motrin on an as needed basis. He also denied flare-ups. Testing from the VA examination showed that, at worst, the left ankle exhibited 35 degrees of plantar flexion and 10 degrees of dorsiflexion. This is 25 degrees of plantar flexion and five degrees of dorsiflexion below the threshold required for a 20 percent rating. The Veteran did not state that the medication improves his range of motion. However, even if it does, the most limited range of motion findings from the examination are well below the threshold required for a 20 percent rating. Moreover, he stated that takes Motrin on an as needed basis and denied experiencing flare-ups, which suggests that the findings at the VA examination are representative of his overall impairment. 

As the evidence is persuasively against assigning a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's left ankle disability, there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021). Accordingly, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent rating for the Veteran's left ankle disability is denied.

4. Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran contends that his service-connected bilateral hearing loss warrants a compensable rating. See March 2024 NOD.

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz). 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

To evaluate the degree of disability from bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII.

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a). In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral. Further, when the average pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his hearing loss in February 2023. He reported that his hearing loss gradually worsens over time with functional impairments from his hearing loss including decreased hearing sensitivity causing increasing speech clarity and noise interference issues.

On the authorized audiological evaluation in February 2023, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	35	45	50	55	60

LEFT	40	45	50	55	65

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 88 percent in the right ear and of 84 percent in the left ear. The average pure tone threshold was 53 hertz in the right ear and 54 in the left ear.

Applying the results to Table VI, the findings equate to a noncompensable disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6100. An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

Based on the evidence above, a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is not warranted.

The Board expressly acknowledges its consideration of the lay evidence of record when adjudicating this claim, including the Veteran's statements that his hearing loss worsens with time and cause functional impairment.  See February 2023 VA examination. The Veteran is competent to report difficulty with his hearing; however, disability ratings for hearing loss are derived from a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations resulting from audiometric testing. See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

The rating criteria contemplate speech reception thresholds and ability to hear spoken words on Maryland CNC testing. The functional impact that the Veteran describes is contemplated by the rating criteria. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017). The Veteran's main complaint is reduced hearing acuity and clarity, which is what is contemplated in the rating assigned. See Rossy v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 142, 145 (2017).

As the evidence is persuasively against assigning a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss, there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021). Accordingly, entitlement to a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
