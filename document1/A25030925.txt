FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's right knee was not manifest by flexion limited to 30 degrees.

2. The Veteran's back disability was not manifest by forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that diabetes mellitus began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that OSA began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

5. The Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and a sleep disorder, are due to service.

6. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that hypertension began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

7. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a diagnosis of periodontal disease at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1983 to July 1986 and from November 1990 to April 1991.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in October 2023 and November 2023and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 and November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee limitation of flexion

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for his right knee.

The Veteran is currently rated 10 percent disabling for limitation of flexion of the right knee under Diagnostic Code (DC) 5260.

Under DC 5260, a 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023.  The Veteran reported flare-ups of the right knee.  His flexion was noted to be limited to 105 degrees with pain.  During flare-ups, the Veteran's flexion was limited to 90 degrees.  

The Board has considered the evidence of record and finds an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee limitation of flexion is not warranted.

A higher rating is not warranted as the evidence of record has not shown (including during flare-ups) limitation of flexion of the right knee limited to 30 degrees.

The Veteran has not identified any other rating criteria that would provide a higher rating or an additional rating.  However, the potential applications of various provisions of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations (2016) have been considered as required by the holding of the Court in Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 593 (1991).

Thus, while the Board has considered whether additional ratings would be appropriate, the Veteran's record does not indicate he suffers from additional right knee disabilities, such as limitation of extension, ankylosis, or recurrent subluxation or lateral instability.

Therefore, entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee limitation of flexion is denied.

In reaching the above conclusion the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the claim that doctrine is not applicable in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

2. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for a back disability

The Veteran contends he is entitled to a higher initial rating for his back disability.

The Veteran's back disability is rated as 20 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5237.  Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023.  The Veteran reported flare-ups of the spine.  The Veteran's forward flexion was limited to 80 degrees, and during flare-ups, was limited to 75 degrees.  No ankylosis was noted.  The examiner also indicated the Veteran had no neurological abnormalities associated with his back disability.

The Board has considered the evidence of record and finds an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for a back disability is not warranted.

A higher rating is not warranted as the evidence of record has not shown (including during flare-ups) forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

Therefore, entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for a back disability is denied.

In reaching the above conclusion the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the claim that doctrine is not applicable in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

3. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus

The Veteran seeks service connection for his diabetes mellitus.

The October 2023 rating decision made the favorable finding that the Veteran has a diagnosis of diabetes.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran's diabetes began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a diagnosis of diabetes, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that it began during active service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  

The Veteran's service treatment records, including his July 1986 and March 1991 separation examinations, are silent for complaints, treatment, or a diagnosis of diabetes.

After service, the first mention of diabetes was in 2009, 18 years after separation from service.

The July 2023 VA examiner also explained that there were no records in service or within a year of separation from service reporting diabetes and that there could not be a nexus to service.  

While the Veteran believes his diabetes was incurred in or due to service, the Board reiterates that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that any in-service injury, event, or disease occurred.

Therefore, as the second element of service connection has not been met, the claim is denied.  Entitlement to service connection for diabetes is denied.

4. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)

The Veteran seeks service connection for OSA.

The October 2023 rating decision made the favorable finding that the Veteran has a diagnosis of OSA.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran's OSA began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a diagnosis of OSA, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that it began during active service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  

The Veteran's service treatment records, including his July 1986 and March 1991 separation examinations, are silent for complaints, treatment, or a diagnosis of OSA.

After service, the first mention of OSA was in 2019, 28 years after separation from service.

The July 2023 VA examiner also explained that there were no records in service or within a year of separation from service reporting OSA and that there could not be a nexus to service.  

While the Veteran believes his OSA was incurred in or due to service, the Board reiterates that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that any in-service injury, event, or disease occurred.

Therefore, as the second element of service connection has not been met, the claim is denied.  Entitlement to service connection for OSA is denied.

5. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety,

The Veteran contends his acquired psychiatric disorder is due to riding in the car with a man who broke his neck, preparing for war in desert with a loud environment of shooting, bombing, and tanks, or landing in a tree while parachuting during service.  See March 2023 Statement in Support of Claim for PTSD.

The first element of service connection has been met as the July 2023 VA examiner indicated the Veteran had been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, and a sleep disorder.

The second element of service connection has been met as personnel records show certificates for the Veteran completing airborne school as well as training in the desert for combat in the middle east.  

Finally, the third element of service connection has been met as the July 2023 VA examiner provided a positive nexus opinion opining it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was due to the claimed stressors reported by the Veteran.

As all three elements of service connection have been met and after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, anxiety, and a sleep disorder is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

6. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension

The Veteran seeks service connection for hypertension.

The October 2023 rating decision made the favorable finding that the Veteran has a diagnosis of hypertension.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran's hypertension began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a diagnosis of hypertension, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that it began during active service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  

The Veteran's service treatment records, including his July 1986 and March 1991 separation examinations, are silent for complaints, treatment, or a diagnosis of hypertension.

After service, the first mention of hypertension was in 2009, 18 years after separation from service.

The July 2023 VA examiner also explained that there were no records in service or within a year of separation from service reporting hypertension and that there could not be a nexus to service.  

While the Veteran believes his hypertension was incurred in or due to service, the Board reiterates that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that any in-service injury, event, or disease occurred.

Therefore, as the second element of service connection has not been met, the claim is denied.  Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

7. Entitlement to service connection for periodontal disease

The Veteran seeks service connection for periodontal disease.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of periodontal disease.

The Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence shows no current periodontal disease, either by diagnosis or by functional impairment, including based on lay evidence reports.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018).  The competent evidence of record does not demonstrate a current periodontal disease disability in any of the medical treatment records and the Veteran is not competent to render his own diagnosis.  See generally King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that it was not erroneous for the Board to find that a lay veteran claiming service connection for a back disorder and his wife lacked the "requisite medical training, expertise, or credentials needed to render a diagnosis" and that their testimony "could not establish medical causation nor was it a competent opinion as to medical causation").

While the Board is cognizant of the ruling in Saunders, which held that pain alone may constitute a disability, in this case the evidence has not demonstrated, and the Veteran has not even alleged, that his periodontal disease has resulted in an impairment of earning capacity.  As such, in this case, neither the lay nor the medical evidence shows a functionally impairing periodontal disease disability.

The September 2023 VA examiner determined that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of periodontal disease.

While the Veteran believes there is a current diagnosis of periodontal disease, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

As the first element of service connection has not been met, a current diagnosis, entitlement to service connection for periodontal disease is denied.

In reaching the above conclusions the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the claim that doctrine is not applicable in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
