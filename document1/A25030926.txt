REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 25, 2019, for a rating higher than 40 percent for prostate cancer residuals is remanded.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1968 to July 1970.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2020 rating decision issued by a Regional Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In May 2015, the Veteran filed a claim for increased rating for prostate cancer residuals.  An August 2015 rating decision denied an increased rating and continued a 20 percent rating based on urinary frequency.  In October 2015, the Veteran submitted additional evidence, including August 2015 VA Medical Center records showing a rising PSA level and an October 2015 statement or opinion by a treating medical provider that active cancer was present.

The Veteran's claim was denied in the August 2015 rating decision and new and material evidence was submitted within one year of that rating decision.  VA not determining whether newly received evidence is new and material can keep a rating decision from becoming final.  Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (until a determination is made as to whether the evidence is new and material under 38 C.F.R. §3.156(b), the claim does not become final).  Therefore, the claim has remained pending since May 2015.

In March 2020, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealing the January 2020 rating decision and elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on June 27, 2023, and a transcript of that hearing is of record.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2020 AOJ decision on appeal, and any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider that evidence in this decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 25, 2019, for a rating in excess of 40 percent for a prostate cancer disability and entitlement to TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

A December 2023 Board decision denied entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 25, 2019, for a rating in excess of 40 percent for a prostate cancer disability and TDIU.  The Veteran appealed the December 2023 Board decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.  In November 2024, the Court granted a Joint Motion for Remand vacating the December 2023 Board decision denying entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 25, 2019, for a rating in excess of 40 percent for a prostate cancer disability and TDIU and remanding the matter for further proceedings consistent with that motion.

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 25, 2019, for a rating higher than 40 percent for prostate cancer residuals is remanded.

The parties to the Joint Motion agreed that the Board did not address an October 2015 statement or medical opinion written by the Veteran's treating family nurse practitioner (FNP), referred to as a urologist in the Joint Motion, reporting that the Veteran's cancer was active.  Additionally, the Joint Motion notes that in May 2019 a VA examiner referred to the cancer as having recurred in 2015.  The parties agreed that the Board must reconcile the findings with that evidence.

The Board notes that the October 2015 statement came with medical records indicating that the Veteran's prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels had risen and noted that treatment had been recommended to the Veteran as helpful to "cancer specific and overall survival."  The analysis section notes prostate cancer status-post radical retropubic prostatectomy with rising PSA levels observed more recently, but is ambiguous regarding whether or not active cancer was present.  Further, it is unclear if the recommended treatment was for active cancer or to minimize the possibility of recurrence.  That represents an unanswered medical question central to the issue of the appropriate rating for the Veteran's prostate cancer disability, and therefore a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error was made by not resolving that ambiguity prior to adjudicating the claim.

The Board finds that remand is necessary to obtain a medical opinion resolving whether or not the August 2015 medical records and October 2015 statement, and all other relevant evidence, show that the Veteran's cancer was active.

2. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is remanded.

Because a decision on the remanded issue of entitlement to an increased rating for a prostate cancer disability could significantly impact a decision on the issue of entitlement to TDIU, the Board finds that the issues are inextricably intertwined.  Because that claim is being remanded, the Board finds that it would be potentially prejudicial to the Veteran for the Board to consider that TDIU claim prior to the determination of the other claim.  Therefore, the adjudication of the TDIU claim must be deferred pending resolution of the increased rating claim.  Harris v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App. 180 (1991).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain all outstanding pertinent VA medical records and associate them with the claims file.

2. Then, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with a medical doctor, one specializing in oncology, if possible, who has not previously examined the Veteran in conjunction with these claims.  The purpose of the examination is to obtain information for the purpose of providing a retrospective medical opinion regarding whether or not the Veteran's cancer had recurred and was active in October 2015.  The examiner must review the claims file, to include especially an October 6, 2015, statement by the Veteran's treating FNP that the cancer was active; August 2015 VA Medical Center records showing a rise in PSA; and a May 2019 VA examination report, and should note that review in the report.

(a.) Confirm that the examiner is a medical doctor, one specializing in oncology if possible.

(b.) Opine whether it is as likely as not that the Veteran had active prostate cancer, or any malignancy related to prostate cancer, from June 13, 2015, to February 21, 2020.  Discuss the significance of PSA levels and the PSA level increase noted in medical records.  The examiner is also asked to address whether recurrence of cancer necessarily means that malignant cells were always present even during the period the Veteran's cancer was considered to be in remission.  Any opinion provided should be supported by sufficient rationale, and the examiner is asked to err on the side of overexplaining as the Board is not permitted to exercise any medical judgment.  

(c.) Discuss the significance of an October 6, 2015, statement by the Veteran's treating FNP that prostate cancer was active; August 2015 VA Medical Center records showing a rise in PSA; and a May 2019 VA examination report.
