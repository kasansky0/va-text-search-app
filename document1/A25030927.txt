ORDER

Restoration of the 70 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with insomnia disorder from September 13, 2023, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a December 2023 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) reduced the Veteran's service-connected PTSD from 70 percent to 50 percent disabling, effective September 13, 2023.

2. Notice of a proposed reduction and of procedural rights under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) was not provided to the Veteran with regard to the most recent reduction in rating for her PTSD.

3. The reduction in rating for PTSD resulted in a reduction of the combined disability rating, from 100 percent to 90 percent, effective September 13, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for restoration of the 70 percent disability rating for PTSD with insomnia disorder from September 13, 2023, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1986 to September 1991.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Whether the reduction in the rating from 70 percent to 50 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder with insomnia disorder, effective September 13, 2023, was proper

The Veteran disagrees with the disability evaluation assigned in the December 2023 rating decision. See February 2024 VA Form 10182.

Congress has provided that a Veteran's disability will not be reduced unless an improvement in the disability is shown to have occurred. 38 U.S.C. § 1155. When an AOJ reduces a rating without following the applicable regulations, the reduction is void ab initio. Greyzck v. West, 12 Vet. App. 288, 292 (1999).

Generally, VA regulations provide that where the reduction in the rating of a service-connected disability is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made, a rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). The beneficiary will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefore and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that compensation payments should be continued at their present level. If additional evidence is not received within that period, final rating action will be taken, and the award will be reduced or discontinued effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). Additionally, the beneficiary must be notified as to the right to a predetermination hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(i). Furthermore, the effective date of the reduction will be the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).

The Board notes, the Veteran's PTSD has been increased and reduced multiple times. See Rating Decisions dated October 2020, February 2021, July 2022, April 2023, and December 2023. 

Following the April 2023 rating decision, which last increased the Veteran's PTSD from 50 percent to 70 percent disabling, in July 2023, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for PTSD. 

Subsequently, in September 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA contracted PTSD examination. Based on that examination, in December 2023, the AOJ decreased the Veteran's rating for her PTSD from 70 percent to 50 percent disabling, effective September 13, 2023, the date of the examination showing improvement. See December 2023 rating decision. The rating reduction resulted in a combined rating reduction from 100 percent to 90 percent, effective September 13, 2023. See December 2023 rating decision codesheet.

Reduction notification procedures were required as the December 2023 rating decision that implemented the rating reduction changed the Veteran's overall disability rating from 100 percent to 90 percent, effective September 13, 2023. The special procedural requirements outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) and (i) were therefore applicable in this case.

Without reaching the merits of the propriety of the reduction in this case, the Board finds that the reduction of the Veteran's service-connected PTSD from 70 percent to 50 percent, effective September 13, 2023, is void ab initio due to the AOJ's failure to adequately follow the procedural requirements set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) and (i).

As noted above, 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) and (i) require that the beneficiary be notified of the proposed action and given 60 days to provide evidence for the presentation of additional evidence, and the opportunity to present evidence or argument at a hearing. In this case, the Veteran was not provided any notice of the proposed rating reduction. The Board finds that such action deprived the Veteran of her due process rights and, therefore, the reduction was not proper.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the reduction in this case is void ab initio, and the 70 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD with insomnia disorder is restored, effective September 13, 2023, which results in a 70 percent rating from November 17, 2022. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), (i).
