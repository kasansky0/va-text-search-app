ORDER

Entitlement to a 100 percent rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder, prior to June 17, 2020, is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is dismissed.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) per 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was awarded a 100 percent rating for his acquired psychiatric disorder, in the October 2021 rating decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), effective June 17, 2020, the date his suicidal ideation began per his medical records. 

2. For the period prior to June 17, 2020, it was not factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation for the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder. 

3.  A 100 percent rating was awarded for acquired psychiatric disorder as of July 17, 2020, leaving no part of the appeal period where the schedular rating is less than total.

4. The Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder, but his additional service connected disabilities alone or in combination do not result in a 60 percent rating, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service connected disability. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a 100 percent rating for service connected acquired psychiatric disorder prior to June 17, 2020, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9400.

2. The question of whether the Veteran is entitled to a TDIU is rendered moot by the grant of a 100 percent rating for acquired psychiatric disorder as of June 17, 2020, leaving no question of law or fact to decide regarding the TDIU issue. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.14, 4.16, 20.104.

3. The criteria for SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1) are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114 (s), 5103(a), 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2009 to June 2013, and was honored with multiple decorations for their service, including the Army Commendation Medal; Army Achievement Medal; Army Good Conduct Medal' National Defense Service Medal; Global War on Terrorism Medal; Iraq Campaign Medal with Campaign Star; and Army Service Ribbon.

The matter comes before the Board on appeal from a rating decision issued in February 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 rating decision that was subsequently subject to a Higher Level Review by the AOJ. 38 C.F.R. §?20.301.  

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. As the Board is deciding the claim of acquired psychiatric disorder, it may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to a 100 percent rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder, prior to June 17, 2020.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for his 100 percent rating for his acquired psychiatric disorder, or at least a rating in excess of 30 percent, prior to June 17, 2020. 

The statutory and regulatory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award of disability compensation are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date for an award of service connection is the day after separation from service or day entitlement arose, if a claim is received within one year of separation from service, otherwise the date of receipt of claim, or the day entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

A claim for VA benefits, whether formal or informal, must be in writing and must identify the benefit sought. 38 U.S.C. § 5101; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155; Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377 (1999). Prior to March 24, 2015, any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, was considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).

While the VA should broadly interpret submissions from a veteran, it is not required to conjure up claims not specifically raised. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32 (1998); Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995). Further, "a veteran's formal claim is required to identify the sickness, disease, or injuries for which compensation is sought, at least at a high level of generality." Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

With regard to the date of entitlement, the term date entitlement arose is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, on a facts-found basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008). However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the AOJ receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers. McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim; a claim reopened after final disallowance; or a claim for increase, will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a) and (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1). The only exception to the rule regarding increased ratings applies when the evidence demonstrates that it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2). If an increase in disability occurred within one-year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." Id. If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of claim. Id. If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 983 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Moreover, under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). For decisions rendered after an initial claim by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182. Id. 

The term "continuous pursuit" only applies to AMA decisions. Specifically, when a claim filed under AMA is granted in an initial decision, the effective date of an AMA initial decision will be the later of the date of the supplemental claim, or the date of entitlement. Thus, even if a supplemental claim is received within one year of a legacy decision, the date of receipt of the supplemental claim will be considered the date of claim for effective date purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h), 3.2500(f). In the event there were an AMA opt-in from an SOC or SSOC, the resulting AMA decisions (either by the AOJ or Board) would be issued in the AMA. Therefore, only they, not the claims before the AMA opt-in, would be subject to the rules governing continuous pursuit. See Id.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

As an initial matter, the Board has broadened the Veteran's claim to acquired psychiatric disorder as the Veteran has been diagnosed with multiple psychiatric disabilities to include generalized anxiety disorder; alcohol abuse disorder; adjustment disorder with depressed mood; alcohol use disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); unspecified depressive disorder; unspecified anxiety disorder; panic disorder; major depressive disorder, chronic; and alcohol dependence. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

By way of background, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his acquired psychiatric disorder in January 2021. The AOJ then issued a rating decision in February 2021 increasing the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder to a 70 percent effective June 17, 2020. The Veteran requested a higher level review in March 2021 requesting an increased rating and earlier effective date for his acquired psychiatric disorder. The AOJ then issued a new rating decision in May 2021 denying the Veterans claims for an increased rating and earlier effective date. Then in September 2021 the Veteran submitted another higher level review request and a supplemental claim in October 2021 requesting an increased rating and earlier effective date for his acquired psychiatric disorder. In October 2021 the AOJ issued a rating decision, based on the September 2021 higher level review, granting a 100 percent rating for the Veterans acquired psychiatric disorder effective June 17, 2020. The AOJ then issued a rating decision in April 2023, based on the October 2021 supplemental claim, denying the Veterans claim for an earlier effective date and increased rating for his acquired psychiatric disorder. The Veteran then filed a request for a higher level review in October 2023 appealing the April 2023 rating decision. The AOJ then issued a rating decision in February 2024 denying the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for his 100 percent rating for his acquired psychiatric disorder, as the AOJ found the Veterans medical records did not show suicidal ideation until June 17, 2020. Additionally, the February 2024 AOJ noted the Veteran would only be entitled to an effective date up to January 14, 2020, but his psychiatric symptomatology did not meet the rating criteria for a 70 or 100 percent rating based on his medical records at the time. Thus, the Veteran appealed the February 2024 rating decision in a June 2024 VA Form 10182.

In this matter, the Board notes that the Veteran is currently service connected at a 100 percent rating for his acquired psychiatric disorder effective June 17, 2020. The AOJ determined the Veteran was entitled to a 100 percent rating effective June 17, 2020, as it is the date his psychiatric symptomatology resulted in suicidal ideation, which had not previously been noted in the Veterans medical records. However, the Veteran may be entitled to an effective date up to a year prior to filing his claim so long as it is factually ascertainable that the claimed condition increased within this time, but not prior, per 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). As the claim was filed January 14, 2021, the Board must determine whether the Veteran is entitled to a rating in excess of 30 percent from January 14, 2021, to June 17, 2020. 

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4. Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Examination reports are to be interpreted in light of the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the Veteran working or seeking work. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. 

All reasonable doubt will be resolved in the claimant's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Id. 

The Veteran's service connected acquired psychiatric disorder was evaluated at a 30 percent effective June 11, 2013, and 100 percent effective June 17, 2020, under the criteria of Diagnostic Code 9400, which provides that such disability is evaluated pursuant to the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

The General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders provides a 30 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, and mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events). 

A 50 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

A 70 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

A 100 percent rating is warranted when there is total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of closest relatives, own occupation, or own name.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 is "symptom-driven," meaning that "symptomatology should be the fact-finder's primary focus when deciding entitlement to a given disability rating" under that regulation. See Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 116-117 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The symptoms listed are not exhaustive, but rather "serve as examples of the type and degree of symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating." Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). In the context of determining whether a higher disability evaluation is warranted, the analysis requires considering "not only the presence of certain symptoms, but also that those symptoms have caused occupational and social impairment in most of the referenced areas" - i.e., "the regulation...requires an ultimate factual conclusion as to the Veteran's level of impairment in most areas." Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 117-118; 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

Further, when evaluating a mental disorder, the Board must consider the "frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission," and must also "assign an evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination." 38 C.F.R. § 4.126 (a). 

Effective August 4, 2014, VA amended the portion of its Schedule for Rating Disabilities dealing with mental disorders and its adjudication regulations that define the term "psychosis" to remove outdated references to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and replace them with references to the recently updated DSM-5. 79 Fed. Reg. 149, 45094 (August 4, 2014). The provisions of the interim final rule apply to all applications for benefits that are received by VA or that were pending before the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) on or after August 4, 2014. VA adopted as final, without change, the interim final rule and clarified that the provisions of this interim final rule do not apply to claims that have been certified for appeal to the Board or are pending before the Board as of August 4, 2014, even if such claims are subsequently remanded to the AOJ. 80 Fed. Reg. 53, 14308 (March 19, 2015). In the instant case, the Veteran's appeal for an increased rating was certified to the Board in July 2024 and, as such, the DSM-V applies to her claim. In this regard, the Board notes that the DSM-5 removed reference to Global Assessment of Functioning scores. 

In this case, the Veteran's medical records do not reflect that it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran met the criteria for a 50 percent rating, or greater, for his service connected acquired psychiatric disorder one year prior to his increased rating claim, January 14, 2021. 

From January 14, 2020, to June 17, 2020, the Veteran's medical records reflect continued treatment for his acquired psychiatric disorder, but no changes in his psychiatric symptomatology. The Veterans psychiatric symptoms reflected panic attacks on occasion; irritability at times; anxiety; depression; excessive alcohol consumption; chronic sleep impairment; no psychosis; and no suicidal or homicidal ideation. Additionally, there were no changes in the Veteran's social life or occupation during such time that would reflect a change in his psychiatric symptomatology. The Veteran's records reflect he had been divorced, had a minor daughter, was engaged, and had some friendships. The Veteran also had been working at a manufacturing plant and noted that his condition, including his alcohol use, had not interfered with his job performance. These records are consistent with the Veteran's medical records prior to January 14, 2020, as such records reflected the same social and occupational information, as well as noted psychiatric symptomatology to include alcohol issues, depression, anxiety, panic attacks occasionally, sleep impairment, no suicidal or homicidal ideation, and no psychosis. 

It was not until the Veteran went into the emergency room at the VA in June 2020 where it became factually ascertainable that the Veterans psychiatric symptomatology resulted in an increase of his acquired psychiatric disorder, as the Veteran clearly expressed suicidal ideation which his medical records had not previously reflected. Although the Board notes that suicidal ideation is not the only contributing factor for the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology, such symptom was the first change within a year of the January 14, 2021, increased rating claim. Further, the Board also considered the Veteran's assertions as to the onset of his suicidal ideation related to his acquired psychiatric disorder, however, the Veterans medical records reflect the Veterans own denial of suicidal and/or homicidal ideation for years prior to June 2020. 

As the Veteran's records do not reflect that it was factually ascertainable that the Veteran's service connected acquired psychiatric disorder increased between January 14, 2020, to June 17, 2020, the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was manifested by psychiatric symptomatology resulting in occupational and social impairment with decrease in work efficiency and intermittent inability in occupational tasks, but not occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity; occupational and social deficiencies with deficiencies in most areas; or total occupational and social impairment. Thus, the Veteran is not entitled to a rating in excess of 30 percent for his service connected acquired psychiatric disorder from January 14, 2020, to June 17, 2020. Consequently, the Board finds the record does not reflect entitlement to a 100 percent rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder, prior to June 17, 2020.

The Board has also considered whether staged ratings under Fenderson, supra, are appropriate for the Veteran's service connected acquired psychiatric disorder during the appeal period; however, the Board finds that his symptomatology has been stable throughout the appeal period. Therefore, assigning additional staged ratings for such disability is not warranted. Furthermore, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the increased rating claim adjudicated herein. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

In reaching such determination, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, the probative evidence is not in approximate balance and weighs against the Veteran's claim. Thus, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable in such regard, and his increased rating claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

2. Entitlement to a TDIU.

TDIU is provided where the combined schedular evaluation for service connected disabilities is less than total, or 100 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). VA will grant a total rating for compensation purposes based on unemployability when the evidence shows that the veteran is precluded from obtaining or maintaining any gainful employment by reason of his or her service connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

In the instant case, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU has been raised by the receipt of the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for acquired psychiatric disorder. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009); Harper v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 345 (2018). 

Here, the Veteran was assigned a 100 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service connected acquired psychiatric disorder effective June 17, 2020. The Veteran's other service connected disabilities include migraines, with migraine variants rated at a 30 percent effective June 11, 2013; right knee sprain rated at a 10 percent effective June 11, 2013; left knee sprain rated at a 10 percent effective June 11, 2013; hypertension rated at a 0 percent effective June 11, 2013; and scar on the right mid-face rated at a 0 percent effective June 11, 2013. 

TDIU is considered a lesser benefit than the 100 percent rating, and the grant of a 100 percent rating generally renders moot the issue of entitlement to a TDIU for the period when the 100 percent rating is in effect. Locklear v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 311, 314, n. 2 (2011). However, the Court has held that a 100 percent schedular rating does not necessarily render the issue of entitlement to TDIU moot, as TDIU could in certain circumstances render the Veteran eligible for SMC benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242 (2010); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).

However, as the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent disability rating for acquired psychiatric disorder during the appeal period, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is moot.

3. Entitlement to SMC per 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1).

The Court has held that VA has a "well-established" duty to maximize a claimant's benefits. Buie, 24 Vet. App. at 250; AB, 6 Vet. App. at 38; Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 280. This duty to maximize benefits requires VA to assess all of a claimant's disabilities to determine whether any combination of disabilities establishes entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 294. There is no prejudice to the Veteran in the Board considering entitlement to SMC in the first instance, as eligibility for this benefit turns solely on the application of law, and the Board's decision is favorable to the extent permitted by law, as discussed below. Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 (1993) (where the Board addresses a question that has not been addressed by the AOJ, the Board must consider the potential for prejudice to the appellant). In any event, SMC benefits "are to be accorded when a Veteran becomes eligible, without need for a separate claim." Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 294 (citing Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991)). In other words, SMC is not a wholly different benefit, but an issue within a claim for an increased or higher initial disability evaluation.

SMC is payable at a specified rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) when a Veteran has a single service connected disability rated as 100 percent and: (1) has additional service connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, separate, and distinct from the 100 percent service connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service connected disability or disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

While the separate disabilities rated as 60 percent disabling must involve separate and distinct anatomical segments or body systems, the fact that the total disability and the independent 60 percent disabilities result from a common etiological agent will not preclude entitlement.

As of June 17, 2020, the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was 100 percent disabling. Thus, for SMC purposes, this disability satisfies the requirement of a "service connected disability rated as total." Buie, 24 Vet. App. at 251; Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 293.

In this matter, the Veteran has a single service connected disability rated as total. The Veteran also has other service connected disabilities including; migraines, with migraine variants rated at a 30 percent effective June 11, 2013; right knee sprain rated at a 10 percent effective June 11, 2013; left knee sprain rated at a 10 percent effective June 11, 2013; hypertension rated at a 0 percent effective June 11, 2013; and scar on the right mid-face rated at a 0 percent effective June 11, 2013. However, such disabilities alone or in combination do not meet the criteria for an additional 60 percent rating for SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1). 

Therefore, entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1), raised by the evidence of record, is not warranted.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
