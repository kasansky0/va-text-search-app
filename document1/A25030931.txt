REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1955 to August 1959. 

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) Higher Level Review rating decision, in which the RO, which in this case is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), denied the instant claim. By way of history, the claim was previously denied in an August 2022 rating decision, for failure to submit new and relevant evidence regarding each of the instant, and previously denied, claims. However, in a March 2023 rating decision the RO determined that a duty to assist had occurred concerning each of the instant claims; thus, the May 2023 rating decision was issued once the duty to assist errors were addressed.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement (NOD) which was received in May 2023, and selected the Hearing docket review option. The Veteran appeared at a Board hearing in September 2023. As the Veteran selected the hearing docket, the Board is limited to review of the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 rating decision, as well as evidence received within 90 days of the September 2023 Board hearing. 38 C.F.R. §20.302(a).

In a January 2024 decision, the Board denied the claims. The Veteran appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC or Court).  

In an October 2024 Court Order granting a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR), the Court vacated the Board's January 2024 decision, and remanded the case for further development in compliance with the directives specified in the JMR.  

1. Entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for residuals of biopsy for left leg malignant melanoma, claimed as a left leg disability to include left leg pain is remanded.

2. Entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for residuals of biopsy for left leg malignant melanoma, claimed as a left ankle disability to include pain and swelling is remanded.

3. Entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for residuals of biopsy for left leg malignant melanoma, to include crotch disfigurement is remanded.

Pursuant to the terms of the October 2024 JMR, a remand is necessary to obtain a competent medical opinion addressing whether the Veteran informed consent was obtained prior to the May 1990 procedure from which the instant claims arise. Failure to do so prior to adjudicating this claim constituted a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an opinion from a VA examiner as to whether the Veteran gave informed consent prior to the May 1990 operation to which he attributes each of the claimed disabilities.
