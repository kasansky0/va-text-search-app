DOCKET NO. 230516-347123
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of entitlement to eligibility for benefits under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

This appeal is duplicative of a separate, timely appeal, under Docket No. 230516-347095, and will be addressed in a separate Board decision.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to eligibility for benefits under the PCAFC have been met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This matter was appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

On May 16, 2023, the Veteran filed two identical VA Form 10182s appealing a claim of entitlement to PCAFC and elected a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). The duplicate 10182s were mistakenly docketed as separate appeals under docket numbers 230516-347095 and 230516-347123 (the instant appeal).

The Board has chosen to adjudicate this claim under Docket No. 230516-347123 and is dismissing this appeal stream as duplicative and docketed at the Board in error. There are no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. The appeal must be dismissed. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.
