REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1967 to June 1969.  

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting review of the October 2018 rating decision based on new and relevant evidence.  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision granting service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus with an effective date of August 9, 2023.  In August 2024, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim, requesting review of the January 2024 rating decision.  In August 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision denying an earlier effective date for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  In October 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), requesting review of the August 2024 rating decision.  In February 2025, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 rating decision.  In his March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

In adjudicating the Veteran's appeal, the Board acknowledges the recent United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) decision in Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), which found that under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2), the Board generally may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) docket switch has elapsed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c) allows an appellant to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days from when the Board receives the original VA Form 10182, or one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, whichever is later, unless: (1) an appellant has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302 and 20.303, or (2) the appellant or representative has requested a waiver of the ability to request to switch dockets during this timeframe.  See also Williams, 37 Vet. App. 305.  In this case, the Board has not solicited a waiver from the Veteran.  However, as the Veteran's case is advanced on the docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c), the Board finds the advanced on the docket status constitutes a waiver of the Veteran's ability to request a docket switch, which would otherwise require the Board to hold the appeal open until one year following the August 2024 rating decision in this case.  Therefore, the Board finds that adjudication of this claim is proper and without prejudice to the Veteran.

Earlier Effective Dates

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim or a claim reopened after final disallowance, shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The effective date of an award of service connection shall be the day following the date of discharge or release if application is received within one year from such date of discharge or release.  Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

To preserve an effective date, an intent to file a claim may be submitted to VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, appropriate to the benefit sought within one-year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 9, 2023, for the award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 9, 2023, for the award of service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than August 9, 2023, for the award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  Specifically, he contends that the effective date for these awards should be October 24, 2018, the date of the last rating decision that denied the Veteran's claims for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, and that he has continuously pursued these claims since the October 2018 rating decision.

Turning to the evidence of record, an October 24, 2018 rating decision denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  

On July 25, 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ (Fully Developed Claim), seeking to reopen his claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  In August 2023 correspondence, the AOJ informed the Veteran that his request was on the wrong form due to the recent passage of the AMA (February 19, 2019).  VA advised the Veteran that, because the claim was filed on the wrong form, it could not be considered a valid claim.  The Veteran was also advised that, if it was more than one year since VA last made a decision on the Veteran's claim and the Veteran had new and relevant evidence to submit as to this claim, he would need to file a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim.  Lastly, he was advised that, if he was not ready to submit a Supplemental Claim form, he could also submit an Intent to File form.  If a completed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim was received within one year from the date of receipt of the Intent to File form, if VA granted the benefits sought, the Veteran may be able to be compensated as early as the date VA received the Intent to File form.

Thereafter, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-0966 (Intent to File a Claim) on August 9, 2023, followed by a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application on December 21, 2023.  A January 2024 rating decision granted service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus with an effective date of August 9, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-0996 Intent to File a Claim.

Upon review of the relevant evidence, the Board determines that an effective date earlier than August 9, 2023, for the award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus is not warranted.  The effective date of the award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus is either the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Here, the October 24, 2018 rating decision denied the Veteran's claims for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  The Veteran did not appeal this rating decision within one year, and it became final.  Following the October 2018 rating decision, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-0996 Intent to File a Claim on August 9, 2023.  Subsequently, VA received his VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application on December 21, 2023, within one year of the VA Form 21-0996 Intent to File a Claim.

As stated above, if VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in paragraph(a) of § 3.160, appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.  Here, the Veteran's VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim, received by VA on August 9, 2023, is the earliest communication received by the Veteran indicating an intent to reopen his claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus after the prior October 24, 2018, rating decision denied these claims.  VA considered the claims for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus filed as of August 9, 2023, the date the Veteran's VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim was received by VA, because VA received a complete VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application within one year of receipt of the Intent to File a Claim form.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's argument that he continuously pursued his claims for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus following the October 24, 2018 rating decision that denied the claims.  As discussed above, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), a claimant may continuously pursue a claim by timely and properly filing a supplemental claim within one year of a VA decision.  If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c).  However, in this case, the Veteran did not file a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application within one year of the October 2018 rating decision that denied the claims for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  Therefore, the October 24, 2018, rating decision became final.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160.  

Here, the record shows that the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application was received by VA on December 21, 2023, following receipt of his August 9, 2023, VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim, nearly 5 years after the October 2018 rating decision.  Between October 24, 2018, and August 8, 2023, the record does not show that the Veteran filed either a VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim under the legacy system (prior to February 19, 2019) or a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (after February 19, 2019) to reopen his claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  While the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim in July 2023, as noted above, this is not a valid claim under the AMA.  The Veteran was informed in August 2023 as to how he could file a supplemental claim under the AMA on a valid VA form to reconsider his claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss that was last denied in the October 2018 rating decision, which he later filed in December 2023, following filing an Intent to File form in August 2023.  Therefore, the currently assigned effective date of August 9, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-0996 Intent to File a Claim, is the earliest available effective date in this case.

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's appeal for an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for his bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  However, the Board is bound by the applicable statutes and regulations.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); 38 C.F.R. § 20.101(a).  Those laws and regulations provide specific guidance as to the documents on which effective dates may be based.  Therefore, the currently assigned effective date of August 9, 2023, for the award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus is proper.

In conclusion, the Veteran's claims for an effective date earlier than August 9, 2023, for the award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus are denied.  In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claims and the positive and negative evidence is not nearly in balance, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).
