ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have a current disability of bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1968 to September 1969.

These issues come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 Rating Decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the October 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy.

The Veteran contends he has bilateral lower extremity neuropathy, and it is related to his military service. See November 2023 Fully Developed Claim. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a)-(b). Secondary causation exists when, but for the service-connected disability, the non-service-connected was caused by a service-connected disability either in a direct, etiological way or via multiple steps in a causal chain. Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (citations omitted). Secondary aggravation exists when the non-service-connected disability not caused by a service-connected disability would be less severe were it not for a service-connected disability. Id. at 1364.

For deciding entitlement to service connection on a direct, secondary, or presumptive basis, the first question before the Board is whether there is a current disability. 

The Veteran submitted private medical treatment records that document treatment for peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities. The note in the treatment record is dated March 18, 2023. A subsequent treatment record from May 23, 2023, indicates no neurologic problems, no areas of focal weakness or numbness, normal gait, and no sensory problems. See March 2024 Medical Treatment Record. 

The Veteran also went to the VA for medical treatment. A VA treatment note from November 2, 2023, contains a comprehensive medical evaluation of the Veteran which includes a neurologic finding that he was alert and had no focal deficits. See CAPRI Records. 

The Veteran did not submit any lay statements describing his symptoms or reporting that a medical professional had diagnosed him with lower extremity neuropathy. 

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for signs, symptoms, complaints, or treatment for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy. See November 2023 Military Personnel Record. 

The Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). Any symptoms the Veteran had prior to his claim appear to have been resolved. The March 2023 complaints did not continue into May 2023, and by the time the Veteran filed his November 2023 claim, the symptoms were not present as the VA physician did not find any neurological symptoms in his examination of the Veteran in November 2023. Finally, the Veteran did not submit any evidence that the symptoms re-occurred or continued. Without a current disability, the first element of service connection fails, both on a direct and secondary service basis. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

A VA examination and medical opinion were not obtained. However, the private treatment records and VA treatment records provide competent medical evidence that there is not a current disability of bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability. As such, a VA medical examination and opinion is not required. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). 

As such, the evidence of record weighs persuasively against a finding of entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy. Because the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The criteria for service connection are therefore not met and service connection must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.
