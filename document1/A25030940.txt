FINDING OF FACT

The April 16, 2021, rating decision proposed a reduction in the ratings for right and left lower leg chronic shin splints/anterior tibial tendonitis and right and left knee mild/moderate ligament laxity but did not implement a reduction in any of the ratings.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of a proposed a reduction in the ratings for right and left lower leg chronic shin splints/anterior tibial tendonitis and right and left knee mild/moderate ligament laxity have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from December 1993 to April 1994, September 2004 to March 2007, August 2009 to August 2011, and August 2011 to January 2012.

In the May 10, 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A hearing was not held. As detailed below, the Veteran was notified on January 10, 2025, that her appeal did not meet the necessary procedural requirements for Board review. 

Dismissal of the appeal of a proposed a reduction in the ratings for right and left lower leg chronic shin splints/anterior tibial tendonitis and right and left knee mild/moderate ligament laxity.

In an April 16, 2021, rating decision, the AOJ proposed reducing the disability ratings for chronic shin splints/anterior tibial tendonitis, for both the right and left lower legs from 20 percent to 0 percent, and for mild/moderate ligament laxity for both knees from 20 percent to 0 percent. The AOJ sent the Veteran a letter on April 20, 2021, stating that the AOJ proposed to reduce the above ratings. The notification letter instructed the Veteran that she could submit evidence to the AOJ within 60 days and request a personal hearing to present evidence or argument within 30 days. The letter instructed that the AOJ would not address the reduction until the time to submit evidence and request a hearing had passed.

The Veteran responded to the April 20, 2021, notification letter by submitting the May 10, 2021, VA Form 10182. The VA Form 10182 specified that the Veteran was seeking to appeal the April 2021 rating decision and listed the issues addressed in this decision. 

In a January 10, 2025, letter, the Veteran was informed that the Board found the Veteran's appeal did not meet the necessary procedural requirements. Specifically, the Board informed the Veteran that no actual reductions of the Veteran's disability ratings were finalized in the April 2021 rating decision and that it was not a final decision on the issues. The Veteran was afforded 60 days to respond to the letter and provide a statement if she disagreed with the Board's determination. See January 2025 BVA Ineligible Appeal Letter. The Board did not receive a response from the Veteran.

A proposed reduction is not a decision that can be appealed to the Board. A Notice of Disagreement (NOD) is "an expression of dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative determination by the agency of original jurisdiction and a desire to contest the result." 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(d). Just as a deferred rating is not an adjudicative determination that can be appealed, a proposed rating is not an adjudicative determination that can be appealed, because the factual and legal questions relevant to the claim have been reserved for adjudication at a later date. Cf. Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 462 (2011). In other words, a decision that merely refers to future action is not a determination by the AOJ, and therefore the filing of a NOD on such a decision does not place the issue in appellate status.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination, decision, or issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees." 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). The term "issue" means an adjudication of a specific entitlement. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). Here, the AOJ has not issued a rating decision implementing the proposed reductions. In fact, a March 2022 rating decision continued the 20 percent disability ratings for each of the above-listed disabilities. As the rating reductions were not implemented there is no determination, decision, or issue with which the claimant disagrees and dismissal of the appeal on this basis is warranted.
