FINDING OF FACT

By correspondence received in September 2024, prior to the promulgation of an appellate decision, the Veteran requested, through his authorized representative, that the present appeal be withdrawn in its entirety.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran and/or his representative have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from April 2004 to September 2011. His decorations include the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board or BVA) on appeal from January 2024 and May 2024 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In the January 2024 decision, the RO, in pertinent part, denied service connection for chronic right shoulder pain. In the May 2024 decision, the RO denied service connection for PTSD and right ankle ligament tear, status post right ankle surgery, as secondary to service-connected disability of the right knee. The Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in August 2024, selecting the hearing review option. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(2).

Dismissal

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Only an appellant, or an appellant's authorized representative, may withdraw an appeal. Id. 

Appeal withdrawals must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf), the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. Id. 

By correspondence received in September 2024, prior to the promulgation of an appellate decision, the Veteran indicated, through his representative, that he wished to withdraw the present appeal in its entirety. The correspondence included the Veteran's name and VA file number. Under the circumstances, the Board finds that the requirements for a proper withdrawal have been satisfied.

As the Veteran has withdrawn his appeal, there remain no allegations of error of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed.
