ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include depression and anxiety, is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for migraine headaches is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's psychiatric disability did not manifest during active service and there is no indication that it is causally related to his active service. 

2. The Veteran's service-connected migraine headaches have not been productive of characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a psychiatric disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303 (2024). 

2. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for migraine headaches are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100 (2024). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service from July 1962 to July 1965. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In October 2024, the Veteran appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 and selecting the Direct Review option. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence before the AOJ at the time of the July 2024 decision. 38 C.F.R. §?20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

In January 2025, the Veteran waived any additional time within which to modify the chosen Board appeal lane. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). Therefore, the Board may proceed with a decision on the claims.

Service Connection - Psychiatric Disability

The Veteran maintains that he has depression and/or anxiety that was incurred in or is related to service. 

A July 1964 service treatment record indicated that the Veteran complained that he felt sick in the stomach, had palpitations, had numbness of the fingers, and general anxiety. He was prescribed medication for treatment, which appears to have been Seroquel; however, the record is not completely legible. At his May 1965 separation examination, his psychiatric evaluation was noted to be normal. On his report of medical history, he indicated that he had a history of depression or excessive worry. The examining clinician noted that the Veteran had occasional depression but no pathology. 

VA treatment records dated from December 2009 to the July 2024 decision on appeal do not show any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to a psychiatric disability. Depression screening was negative in December 2009, March 2011, June 2012, September 2013, December 2014, March 2016, March 2017, July 2018, July 2019, November 2020, January 2022, January 2023, and January 2024. In December 2009, the Veteran denied experiencing depression, anxiety, and delusions. In March 2017, he denied experiencing suicidal/homicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. In July 2019, January 2020, and November 2020, he denied experiencing mood swings, anxiety, and depression. In October 2023, he denied experiencing depression, anxiety, mood swings, and sleep disturbances. In June 2024, it was noted that he had no complaints of depression or anxiety. 

During a February 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported that after moving back from Korea, his job was unavailable, and he lost motivation and wanted to "get out." He stated that he had a difficult time finding his purpose. He indicated that as he had gotten older, he became less social and felt withdrawn and isolated. He indicated that he felt low motivation around half the week and did not desire to engage in activities he used to enjoy. He indicated that he slept about four hours broken up throughout the night, had difficulty staying asleep, and woke up multiple times throughout the night. He also endorsed decreased appetite, concentration, memory, and focus. He stated that he had mild anxiety when thinking about how things were working out for him. He indicated that his low mood and anxiety began about 20 years ago (in 2004) when he had problems in his relationship with his wife due to health concerns. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with unspecified depressive disorder, noting that the Veteran experienced a shift in his negative emotions when moving to Las Vegas, as he lost his support group and his wife due to divorce, and that it did not appear that the Veteran's depressive symptoms started during service. The examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by service. The examiner noted that the Veteran reported that his symptoms began 20 years ago when navigating his wife's medical problems and then ultimately divorcing, and that he was living in Las Vegas independently and felt withdrawn. It was noted that he denied experiencing mental health symptoms during service, except for mild stress due to exploring his career path. 

In this case, the Board finds the most probative evidence weighs against the claim. Although the Veteran was noted to have general anxiety in July 1964, and he reported having or having had "depression or excessive worry" at his May 1965 separation examination, the evidence does not indicate any ongoing treatment for a chronic psychiatric disorder during service. At his May 1965 separation examination, it was noted that he had occasional depression but no pathology, and his psychiatric evaluation was noted as normal. This evidence suggests that while he may have had symptoms of depression and anxiety during service, those symptoms were not chronic or severe enough for a formal diagnosis. The evidence also does not show any treatment for psychiatric symptoms following service. In fact, VA treatment records dated from December 2009 to July 2024 indicate that the Veteran repeatedly denied experiencing depression, mood swings, and anxiety. Thus, this is not a case where there is an absence of treatment following service, but the specific denial of ongoing symptomatology following service. 

The first and only indication of a psychiatric disability was the diagnosis of unspecified depressive disorder made by the February 2024 VA examiner, more than 58 years after the Veteran was discharged from service. The length of time between active service and the initial documentation of the claimed disability is a factor that tends to weigh against a claim for service connection. Furthermore, at the time of the VA examination, although the Veteran reported experiencing low mood/motivation after returning from Korea and not having a job available, he also indicated that his current symptoms began 20 years ago (in 2004) when he moved to Las Vegas and after divorcing his wife. 

In addition, the February 2024 VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's current psychiatric disability was incurred in or was related to service. The examiner reviewed the claims file, considered and addressed the Veteran's contentions, and provided rationale for the opinion. For those reasons, the Board finds the VA examiner's opinion significantly probative. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008). There are no medical opinions to the contrary.

The Board has also considered the lay evidence of record. The Veteran is competent to describe what he has personally observed or experienced; however, to the extent his statements conflict with the contemporaneous medical evidence, the Board does not find them credible. Furthermore, the ultimate question of etiology in this case extends beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship and is beyond the competence of lay witnesses.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable as the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim and is not in approximate balance. Therefore, entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) (2018); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Increased Rating - Migraine Headaches

The Veteran maintains that his service-connected migraine headaches warrant a rating greater than 0 percent. 

Under Diagnostic Code 8100, migraines are rated as follows: a noncompensable (0 percent) rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks; a 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months; a 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months; and a 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. 

The Board notes that the rating criteria do not define the term "prostrating." See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100. Clinically, "prostrating" is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1554 (31st ed. 2007). In nonmedical terms, prostrating is defined as lying flat or at full length, to reduce to physical weakness or exhaustion, or to reduce to helplessness. In Johnson v. Wilkie, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" was defined as describing migraine attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018). 

In this case, VA treatment records dated from December 2009 to the July 2024 decision on appeal, do not show any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of a chronic headache disability. In fact, the Veteran specifically denied experiencing headaches in September 2013, June 2014, July 2019, January 2020, November 2020, July 2021, December 2021, January 2022, April 2022, July 2022, January 2023, October 2023, January 2024, June 2024, and July 2024. 

During a February 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he first developed migraines while he was stationed in Korea. He stated that his symptoms started with blurry vision, left hand numbness and tingling, and then left temporal migraine. He reported that he was treated with Darvon during service, and that the condition had progressively worsened. He reported that he took over-the-counter medications to treat his current symptoms. The diagnosis was migraine including migraine variants. The examiner noted that the Veteran experienced nausea, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, changes in vision, sensory changes, and numbness and tingling in his left hand. Typical head pain lasted one to two days. The examiner, however, indicated that the Veteran's migraine headaches did not involve characteristic prostrating attacks. Regarding the functional impact on his ability to work, the evidence indicates that the Veteran retired in 2001 after working at Allstate Insurance for 28 years, and then sold real estate until the market crashed. During the February 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he lost the ability to work during the onset of his migraines and that he required the ability to excuse himself from the work environment and rest in a quiet, dark room. It was noted that occupational tasks that required prolonged staring at computer screens or static or dynamic objects for long durations without breaks should be avoided. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board does not find that an initial rating in excess of 0 percent is warranted for headaches at any time during the appeal period. The VA treatment records indicated that the Veteran repeatedly denied experiencing headaches, despite his reports to the February 2024 VA examiner that he had progressively worsening headaches since service. In this regard, the Board finds the statements made by the Veteran to his treating physicians more credible as they were made during the course of seeking medical care and with a strong motivation to be truthful in order to seek proper care. On the other hand, the Board finds the statements made to the VA examiner in the course of seeking compensation are less credible in this instance as they conflict with the contemporaneous medical records. The VA treatment records do not show any reports of headaches, much less characteristic prostrating attacks of headaches. The VA examiner reviewed the claims file and also opined that the Veteran did not have prostrating headache attacks. For these reasons, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximate migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months. Therefore, a rating in excess of 0 percent is not warranted. 

Consideration has been given to assigning staged ratings. However, at no time during the period in question has the disability warranted a higher schedular rating than that assigned. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).
