ORDER

Entitlement to service connection an eye disability, diagnosed as a left eye peripheral corneal scar and bilateral dry dye syndrome, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's eye disability, diagnosed as a left eye peripheral corneal scar and bilateral dry dye syndrome, is related to his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for an eye disability, diagnosed as a left eye peripheral corneal scar and bilateral dry dye syndrome, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1981 to August 1999.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) thanks the Veteran for his many years of service to our country.

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the August 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.  In August 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the rating decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

In his April 2023 application for benefits, the Veteran claimed service connection for a disability characterized as "Eye (Vision)", and the initial June 2023 rating decision denied service connection for residuals of a left eye injury, but also explained myopic refractive error was noted for both eyes with best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 for each eye.  In his August 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, (and again in his September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)), the Veteran referenced both his left eye and his right eye.  The December 2023 rating decision, issued in January 2024, found a duty to assist error had been identified during the higher-level review for eye injury (vision) (now claimed as residual of right eye injury and residual of left eye injury), and also endorsed a favorable finding related to a diagnosis of bilateral dry eye syndrome with a peripheral corneal scar.  The August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal characterized the issue as "[t]he previous denial of service connection for DTA Error - Exam/MO:  Service connection for residuals of left eye injury is confirmed and continued" and also provided a favorable finding that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability, as medical records showed diagnoses of corneal scar, left eye and bilateral dry eye syndrome.  Thus, as the Veteran generally claimed service connection for an eye disability, referenced both eyes in his higher-level review request and Board appeal, and as each rating decision referenced and/or provided favorable findings as to a bilateral eye disability, the Board has recharacterized this claim for an eye disability, however diagnosed, as to this is more favorable to the Veteran.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009); Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79 (2009).

Also, in the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran expressed disagreement with June 7, 2023 and December 29, 2023 decisions; however, the September 2024 VA Form 10182 not timely as to the June 7, 2023 issued on June 8, 2023, and the December 28, 2023 decision (there is no December 29, 2023 decision), issued on January 2, 2024, did not adjudicate the claim but rather found a duty to assist error.  The only decision, which adjudicated this claim and which the August 2024 VA Form 10182 is timely as to is the August 26, 2024 rating decision, issued on August 27, 2024. The Board has viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the Veteran and finds the August 2024 decision is the decision on appeal.  See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).  

As a final introductory matter, the Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  There, the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  In the present case, as the claim herein is granted in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in this regard, and further delay would service no useful purpose or avail the Veteran of any additional benefit.

1. Entitlement to service connection an eye disability

The Veteran asserts service connection for an eye disability is warranted.  In his April 2023 application for benefits, the Veteran reported a piece of metal became lodged in his eye while stationed in Germany.  During the May 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported during his time in Germany, he was working during a "fog walk" picking up foreign objects, when a on a small fragment of metal became lodged in his right eye, that the particle was attempted to be removed on base, but that he was then sent to an Army specialist, who removed the particle at that time.  During the May 2023 VA examination, the Veteran also reported worse vision in his right eye than the left eye since that time, and that he was no longer able to wear contact lenses due to frequent irritation of his right eye when removing the lenses, and he had frequent dry, irritated, gritty eyes, which often became red, which were treated with artificial tears as needed.  Also, in his August 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Veteran indicated his right was very scratchy, very dry, and also referenced his vision.

Generally, service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  To establish service connection on a direct incurrence basis, the Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The appeal period for consideration is from April 16, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's original claim, which was continuously pursued, to August 27, 2024, the date the AOJ decision on appeal was issued.

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The August 2024 decision on appeal provided favorable findings as to this claim. Specifically, that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability, as medical records showed diagnoses of a corneal scar, left eye, and bilateral dry eye syndrome, and also that the evidence showed that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service, as medical records showed the removal of a small metal fragment that had since resolved.  Indeed, consistent with these favorable findings, a May 2023 VA examiner endorsed diagnoses of left eye peripheral corneal scar and bilateral dry dye syndrome.  Also, March 1993 service treatment records documented the Veteran had a left eye corneal abrasion, and August 1993 service treatment records documented related complaints, including that the Veteran reported it felt like the left eye corneal abrasion from March 1993 was not healed.  Also, a July 1983 service treatment record documented the Veteran reported left eye pain but denied trauma, a December 1987 in-service examination noted a left eye injury in July 1983, an October 1990 service treatment record documented the Veteran had had a left eye injury in 1982 with no sequalae, and a May 1991 service treatment records documented the Veteran reported right eye irritation, and that he was hit in the right eye two days ago with an electric cord.

Thus, the question becomes whether the Veteran's left eye peripheral corneal scar and/or bilateral dry dye syndrome were related to service.  In this regard, there are probative opinions in favor of and against the claim.

The evidence against the claim includes a May 2023 VA examiner's opinion.  The May 2023 VA examiner found the claimed condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  As a rationale, the May 2023 VA examiner stated that there no pathology to warrant a diagnosis, cited to service treatment records, and noted that myopic refractive error was noted for both eyes with best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 for each eye.  However, the May 2023 VA examiner provided an inconsistent rationale.  Specifically, the May 2023 VA examiner found that there that there no pathology to warrant a diagnosis, which conflicted with the endorsed diagnoses left eye peripheral corneal scar and bilateral dry dye syndrome, and thus, this opinion is of little, if any, probative value.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

Thus, as the May 2023 VA opinion was inadequate, supplemental opinions were obtained, and the evidence in favor of the claim includes a February 2024 VA opinion.  The February 2024 VA opinion noted reviewed of the conflicting medical evidence and found there was pathology of peripheral corneal scars and dry eye syndrome, that warranted diagnoses, and explained the peripheral corneal scar resulted from a foreign body in eye and explained the Veteran had symptoms of dry eyes and redness that were consistent with dry eye syndrome.

Also, in another opinion, the same VA examiner who provided the February 2024 VA opinion provided a second supplemental opinion in August 2024.  The August 2024 VA opinion explained there was no evidence of a right eye injury during the examination, as the injury had resolved, the only condition that remained was a corneal scar from the foreign body, and the peripheral corneal scar resulted from a foreign body in eye as it was a common symptom of a foreign body in the eye.  Here, the August 2024 VA opinion was clearly referencing the left eye not the right eye, as the left eye peripheral corneal scar was the diagnosis endorsed in the May 2023 VA examination report, and which is also consistent with the above discussed service treatment records.  Moreover, the Board finds the August 2024 VA opinion linking the Veteran's left eye peripheral corneal scar to a foreign body in eye, which was documented during service, to be sufficiently probative, resulting in the evidence being in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's left eye peripheral corneal scar is related to his active service.  Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304.

The August 2024 VA opinion also found, for the dry eye syndrome, a common risk factor exposure was exposure to poor environmental conditions.  The August 2024 VA opinion further explained that poor environmental conditions could lead to a reduction of tear film in the Veteran, which caused the watery layer of the tear film to evaporate too quickly, that then the lacrimal glands made more watery tears to compensate for the reduction of tear film, but that the tears could not properly coat the Veteran's eyes and caused dry eye syndrome.  The August 2024 VA opinion found the Veteran likely experienced this poor environment while in service as where the Veteran was deployed was known for poor environmental conditions.  The Board finds the August 2024 VA opinion linking the Veteran's bilateral dry dye syndrome to service, to be sufficiently probative, resulting in the evidence being in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's bilateral dry dye syndrome is related to his active service.  Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304.

The Board also recognizes the May 2023 VA examiner found myopic refractive error was noted for both eyes with best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 for each eye.  However, according to the applicable regulations, in the absence of superimposed disease or injury, service connection may not be allowed for refractive error of the eyes, including myopia, presbyopia and astigmatism, even if visual acuity decreased in service, as this is not a disease or injury within the meaning of applicable legislation relating to service connection.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(c), 4.9.  Here, there is no evidence the Veteran's refractive error of either eye resulted from a superimposed disease or injury.  Indeed, the Veteran's December 1980 enlistment examination, as to a defect or disease, explicitly listed both refractive error and a color vision defect.  See McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15 (2016).  Moreover, as discussed above, during the May 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported worse vision in the right eye than his left eye; however, his service treatment records unequivocally demonstrated his in-service corneal abrasion was of his left eye, and thus, the Veteran reported his right eye, which did not sustain an in-service corneal abrasion, was worse.  As such, to the extent that the Veteran's claim concerns this diagnosis, no further development is required, and service connection is not warranted.

Thus, upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's eye disability, diagnosed as a left eye peripheral corneal scar and bilateral dry dye syndrome, is related to service.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for an eye disability, diagnosed as a left eye peripheral corneal scar and bilateral dry dye syndrome, is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
