ORDER

A rating of 100 percent for unspecified major depressive disorder recurrent is granted.

Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) based on housebound status is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Since the filing of the Veteran's claim in March 2022, the competent and probative evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder manifested through total occupational and social impairment. 

2. The Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent rating for major depressive disorder and has a separate combined 60 percent rating for his other, independent service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a rating of 100 percent for PTSD are met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 ; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9434. 

2. The criteria for SMC at the housebound rate are met. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1973 to March 1975. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July (notice on August 2nd) 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Procedurally, following a March 2022 claim (VA 21-526EZ) for increased compensation, a May 2022 rating decision denied an increased rating for unspecified major depressive disorder. In April 2023, the Veteran requested Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the May 2022 decision regarding the psychiatric disorder. A July 2023 HLR decision denied the increased rating claim.

In his January 2024 notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182), the Veteran referenced the July 2023 decision (via the notification letter) elected the Board's Direct Review docket. Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of May 11, 2022-the date of the rating decision which prompted the Veteran's selection of the HLR review lane. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 3.2601(f). If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after May 11, 2022, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Additionally, the Board notes that, in the VA Form 10182, the Veteran also raised the issues of total disability rating based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) and entitlement to special monthly compensation, which were not adjudicated in the July 2023 rating decision. Thereafter, the issue of entitlement ot TDIU had been remanded by a separate May 2024 Board decision for further development, Subsequently, a January 2025 rating decision granted entitlement to TDIU, effective July 9, 2015. As such, the Board will not address TDIU, but will address the ancillary benefit of SMC, housebound below.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the 

VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The percentages are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, the Board must also consider staged ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for unspecified major depressive disorder recurrent.

The May 2022 and July 2023 rating decision continued the Veteran's 70 percent rating for unspecified major depressive disorder.

Psychiatric disabilities are rated based on the General Rating Formula codified in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, which provides disability ratings based on a spectrum of symptoms. "A veteran may qualify for a given disability rating by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of a similar severity, frequency, and duration." Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 117 (Fed. Cir. 2013). VA must consider all symptoms of a claimant's condition that affect the level of occupational and social impairment, including, if applicable, those identified in the American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 1994) (DSM-IV) and (5th ed. 2013) (DSM-5). See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442-43 (2002).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has observed that the listed symptoms are examples of the type and degree of the manifestations of a mental disability required for a given disability rating, and that "the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms" is not required to support a disability rating. Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442. Accordingly, it is not sufficient for the Board to simply match the symptoms listed in the rating criteria against those exhibited by a veteran. Rather, "VA must engage in a holistic analysis" of the severity, frequency, and duration of the signs and symptoms of the veteran's mental disorder, determine the level of occupational and social impairment caused by those signs and symptoms, and assign an evaluation that most nearly approximates that level of occupational and social impairment. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017).

In pertinent part, under the General Rating Formula, in pertinent part, a 70 percent is warranted when the Veteran experiences occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or work like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

A 100 percent rating is warranted for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of closest relatives, own occupation, or own name. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

Considerations in evaluating a mental disorder include the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission. The evaluation must be based on all evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on an examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination. 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(a). Although the extent of social impairment is a consideration in determining the level of disability, the rating may not be assigned solely on the basis of social impairment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(b).

As noted above, in order to warrant a higher rating, the Veteran's disability would have to be manifested by total occupational and social impairment.

A February 2022 disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) was completed by a VA clinician. The Veteran's symptoms were documented as: depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; near-continuous depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events; impairment of short and long term memory; flattened affect; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; and, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting; inability to establish and maintain relationships; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living; and, disorientation to time and place. The clinician noted that the has total occupational and social impairment. The clinician further described how the Veteran's psychiatric disorder substantially impacts his ability to function and interact appropriately with other people. 03/14/2022, VA Examination,

A May 2022 VA examination documented the Veteran's symptoms as: depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks more than once a week; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; and, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting; inability ot establish and maintain relationships; and, suicidal ideation. The examiner indicated that the Veteran has occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. The examiner remarked that the Veteran has a low acute level of suicide risk and encouraged the Veteran to seek further mental health treatment. 05/04/2022, C&P Exam. 

After review of the competent and probative evidence, the Board finds the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder most nearly approximated the criteria for a 100 percent rating throughout the period on appeal. Throughout this period, the Veteran has shown an intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living, including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene, and danger of hurting himself. 

The Board places considerable probative weight on the February 2022 DBQ, which provided a thorough analysis of the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms. Specifically, the Veteran is unable to function appropriately with other people and has difficulty with performing activities of daily living. Additionally, the May 2022 VA examiner also noted the acute level of suicide risk and danger of harming himself. 

Given the above, the Board finds that, when viewed against all of the relevant competent medical and lay evidence of record, the Veteran's overall disability picture is more nearly approximated by the 100 percent evaluation. Therefore, after looking at the totality of the Veteran's psychiatric disability picture, the Board finds that the evidence warrants a rating of 100 percent due to total occupational impairment and more nearly approximated social impairment. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Entitlement to SMC

SMC is available when, 'as the result of service-connected disability,' a veteran suffers additional hardships above and beyond those contemplated by VA's schedule for rating disabilities." Breniser v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 64, 68 (2011) (citing 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114 (k)-(s)). Section 1114(l) provides five distinct ways for a veteran, "as the result of service-connected disability," to qualify for this rate of SMC: (1) anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet; (2) anatomical loss or loss of use of one hand and one foot; (3) blindness in both eyes with 5/200 visual acuity or less; (4) being permanently bedridden; or (5) having "such significant disabilities as to be in need of regular aid and attendance." 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s), SMC is payable at the housebound rate if the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and either of the following are met: (1) there is additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or (2) he or she is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

The requirement of "permanently housebound" will be considered to have been met when the veteran is substantially confined to his or her house (ward or clinical areas, if institutionalized) or immediate premises due to a service-connected disability or disabilities which it is reasonably certain will remain throughout his or her lifetime.

?

In this case, the Veteran has been granted a 100 percent rating from March 2022 onward for his major depressive disorder. As such, the Veteran has a 100 percent rating and other ratings that combine to 60 percent or greater. 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. The Veteran has a single disability (depressive disorder) rated at 100 percent disabling. Additionally, he has other, independent service-connected disabilities that are rated at least 60 percent (multiple orthopedic disabilities.). As such, he meets the criteria for entitlement to SMC(s). 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). Consequently, entitlement to SMC(s) is granted. The effective date of this award will be assigned by the AOJ upon implementation of this decision.
