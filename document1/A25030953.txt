ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for depressive disorder as secondary to service-connected left ankle disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his depressive disorder is caused by his service-connected left ankle disability.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for depressive disorder as secondary to service-connected left ankle disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran honorably served in the United States Army from March 1983 to March 2003. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In his August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the August 2024 decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Although the Veteran has not waived the remaining time to change to another AMA docket, the Board is reminded that its mission is to dispose of appeals properly in a timely manner. 38 U.S.C. § 7101(a); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). Moreover, as it is granting the Veteran's claim in full, there is no prejudice or harm to the Veteran in proceeding with issuing a decision. 

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the evidence of record in conjunction with this case. However, it has limited its discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008). Thus, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim on appeal. 

Entitlement to service connection for depressive disorder as secondary to service-connected left ankle disability is granted.

The Veteran seek service connection for depressive disorder and contends that it arises from his service connected disabilities. See November 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Compensation. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability that is due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show: (1) that a current disability exists; and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995). 

Careful analysis of an October 2022 Mental Disorders Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) shows that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of depressive disorder from a private physician. See November 2022 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) - Veteran Provided. Further review of the October 2022 Mental Disorders DBQ shows that the private physician opined that the Veteran's depressive disorder was caused by his medical conditions, including his service-connected left ankle disability.

There is also evidence against the claim. In February 2023, May 2023, July 2023, and March 2024 medical opinions, VA examiners opined that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of depressive disorder, nor was his claimed disability caused by or aggravated by his service connected disabilities. See February 2023, May 2023, July 2023, and March 2024 Medical Opinion DBQs. 

Without further analysis, the October 2022 private opinion and the February 2023, May 2023, July 2023, and March 2024 VA medical opinions can be said to be, at best, of equal probative value. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511-12 (1995). In this case, the October 2022 private medical opinion places the evidence of record in, at the very least, approximate balance as to whether secondary service connection is warranted. The Board thus resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, and his claim of entitlement to service connection for depressive disorder as secondary to service-connected left ankle disability is granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102; 3.310; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
