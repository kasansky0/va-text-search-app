REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for asthma is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1997 to March 2004. 

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2022 decision. In June 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2022 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to an increased rating for asthma, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). There, the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). In this case, a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) as it is more than one year from the date that the AOJ mailed notice of the decision on appeal, and it is more than 60 days of the date that the Board received the July 2024 VA Form 10182. Therefore, the Board shall proceed with adjudication.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for asthma is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his asthma warrants a higher rating. See September 2020 VA Form 20-0996.  Specifically the Veteran's attorney asserted that throughout the period under review, the Veteran treated his asthma with prescribed Flovent and Advair which both contain corticosteroids as noted in the VA examinations, and that a new VA examination was warranted to clarify this matter. See July 2024 VA Form 10182.

A December 2021 VA respiratory conditions examiner, who conducted a records examination only, found that the Veteran required the use of inhaled medications in the form of intermittent inhalational bronchodilator therapy. However, the examiner further found that the Veteran did not require the use of oral bronchodilators, antibiotics, or outpatient oxygen therapy for his respiratory condition. The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran had been called but he had not responded. It is unclear from the records whether the Veteran was timely notified of his VA examination, as he attended other VA examinations close to the time of the December 2021 VA examination, and the record supports that the Veteran might not have known about his VA examination before the decision was rendered. 

In light of the Veteran's contentions regarding the use of corticosteroids and the December 2021 records only examination, the Board finds that a remand is warranted to afford the Veteran with an adequate VA examination. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). Failure to obtain an adequate VA examination is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Veteran is advised that any findings reported during this new VA examination will be critical to the adjudication of his asthma, and that VA's duty to assist is not a one-way street. He also has an obligation to cooperate with VA in ensuring that duty is satisfied. See Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171 (2005); Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991). Furthermore, any failure to report for any scheduled examination without good cause may result in an adverse determination. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.	

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination by an examiner with appropriate expertise to address the current level of severity from the Veteran's service connected asthma.  The claims file must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner.  Any indicated studies should be performed.  The need for further in-person examination is left to the discretion of the examiner. 

The examiner should discuss all functional impairments related to the Veteran's service connected asthma. The examiner should specifically address whether the Veteran had been prescribed corticosteroids to treat his asthma and should indicate whether Flovent and Advair are corticosteroids and/or immuno-suppressive medications.

A rationale should be provided for all opinions offered. 

The medical opinion must support the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate for the Board to consider and weigh against other evidence of record; medical opinions must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. If an opinion cannot be expressed without resorting to speculation, ensure that the clinician so indicates and discusses why an opinion is not possible, to include whether there is additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.
