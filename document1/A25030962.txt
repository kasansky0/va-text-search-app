ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that tinnitus began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Navy from February 1969 to December 1972.

This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a June 2024 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). Given the date of the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran's appeal is governed by the modernized review system (known by the Board as AMA). 38 C.F.R. § 19.2. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran asserts he is entitled to service connection for tinnitus.

Generally, to establish service connection there must be competent evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the in-service injury incurred or aggravated during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1116 (f), a claimant, who, during active service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that he was not exposed to any such agent during that service. Diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents, listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e), will be considered to have been incurred in service under the circumstances outlined in that section even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service, the listed diseases shall be service-connected if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(iii) are met, even though there is no record of such disease during service, provided further that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (d) are also satisfied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

In the June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made favorable findings of participation in toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), in-service exposure to hazardous noise, and a current diagnosis of tinnitus. Despite these findings, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim because there was no medical nexus linking the Veteran's tinnitus to his military service. Nevertheless, the Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings under the AMA.

Tinnitus is not a disability on the enumerated list of presumptive diseases under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e). Thus, the remaining question before the Board is whether there is a medical nexus linking the Veteran's tinnitus to his military service. 

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran appeared for a VA examination in April 2024. He reported that his tinnitus began gradually in 2014. He did not report a specific noise exposure incident preceding the onset. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by, or the result of, military noise exposure. The examiner explained that current literature does not support late-onset noise-induced tinnitus. 

Another VA medical opinion was obtained in June 2024. Here, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by TERA. The examiner explained that medical literature does not support late-onset toxin-induced tinnitus and noted that the Veteran would have experienced symptoms in service and the onset of tinnitus would have been proximal to the exposure.

Upon reviewing the pertinent evidence of record, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is not warranted. In this regard, the medical evidence of record does not establish that a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and his military service (to include TERA) is present. The Veteran reported that his tinnitus began in 2014; the VA medical opinions of record state that medical literature does not support late-onset noise-induced, or toxin-induced, tinnitus. Further, there is no medical opinion of record to the contrary.

Thus, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is not warranted. 

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, the persuasive evidence of record is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for tinnitus. As such, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and his claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, supra.
