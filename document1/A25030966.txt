DOCKET NO. 240719-456341
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a lung disease, to include interstitial lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's lung disease was etiologically linked to his active-duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a lung disease have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the U.S. Navy from October 1974 to October 1978.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran filed a July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and selected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Under C.F.R. § 20.202?(c)(2), the appellant has until May 2025 to modify his choice of Board appeal lane, and the "Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up." See?Williams?v. McDonough,?37 Vet. App. 305?(2024). However, because in this matter a?full grant?of the issue on appeal is warranted, the Veteran is not prejudiced by the Board issuing this decision without such a delay.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a lung condition, to include interstitial lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is granted.

The Veteran seeks to establish service connection for a lung condition, to include interstitial lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He contends that he developed several respiratory issues as a result of his service, including a partial lung collapse, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and an interstitial lung disease leading to a lung transplant. See May 2022 lay statement. 

Service connection may be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d). Generally, to establish service connection, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service." Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is an approximate balance in the evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Veteran contends that his current lung condition is related to his service. He contends that he was exposed to different chemicals while performing renovations and maintenance of ship spaces during his service. He further contends that he was treated for related lung issues while in service. A review of the service treatment records confirm the Veteran was treated for acute pneumothorax in January 1976. See January 1976 service treatment records. Additionally, VA has already conceded the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), specifically finding a probability of exposure to asbestos during service. 

The Veteran is competent to report his readily observable symptoms. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).? The Veteran's lay statements are consistent with the medical treatment records before the Board, who accordingly find him credible and give his Lay Statements significant probative weight.

The Veteran submitted two August 2023 private medical opinions. The first examiner concluded that after reviewing the Veteran's medical and service history, that as a pulmonary disease specialist, it is "more likely than not that [the Veteran's] interstitial lung disease/IPF is related to inhalational exposures encountered during his time in military service. The second opinion, from a physician at the facility that performed the Veteran's April 2021 lung transplant, noted the Veteran's continued exposure from asbestos dust during service and similarly concluded that the Veteran's "interstitial lung disease was likely correlated with his asbestos exposure." 

The Board notes that there are several VA examinations of record that rendered negative nexus opinions. See May 2024, March 2024, October 2023, and December 2022 VA examinations. However, each of these opinions are inadequate for appellate review. The May 2024 and March 2024 opinions provided exclusively conclusory rationale in support of their opinions, the October 2023 VA opinion based their rationale on an inaccurate finding that the Veteran did not participate in a TERA, and the December 2022 VA opinion failed to provide a full etiological opinion for the Veteran's lung condition. Furthermore, none of the VA examiners provided sufficient relevant discussion of the Veteran's January 1976 in-service injury or either of the August 2023 private medical opinions. As such, they are inadequate for appellate review and the Board assigns them no probative value.

Turning to the elements of service connection, the Veteran has a current diagnosis for an interstitial lung disease, specifically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. See August 2023 private medical opinion. As such, the first element has been met. The second element, an in-service occurrence, has also been met as the record shows the Veteran was treated for a respiratory condition in service and his in-service toxic exposure has already been conceded. Accordingly, the second element has been met.

As for the third element, a causal relationship between the current disability and in-service injury, the two August 2023 private medical opinions provided an association between the Veteran's current lung condition and his service. The Board finds that the August 2023 private medical opinions are is adequate for appellate review. There is no evidence that the physicians are not competent or credible, and as the reports are based on the Veteran's statements, medical history and records, and the physicians' observations, the Board finds them entitled to significant probative weight. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 305 (2008). Absent medical evidence of higher probative value against the medical association between the Veteran's current lung condition to his service, the Board finds that the third element for service connection has been met.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the totality of the available probative evidence is, at least, in relative balance as to whether the Veteran's lung condition is related to his service. Resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that service connection for a lung condition, to include interstitial lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
