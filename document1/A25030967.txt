ORDER

The appeal for service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a February 2025 written statement, the Veteran, through his attorney, withdrew his appeal for service connection for sleep apnea.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal for service connection for sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2002 to October 2002 and from December 2003 to April 2005.

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2020 rating decision.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. See id. 

The Veteran requested a hearing in this appeal, and one was scheduled for April 9, 2025. In response to notice of the hearing, the Veteran's attorney canceled the hearing and withdrew his appeal for service connection for sleep apnea via written correspondence received on February 17, 2025. Because there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.

This dismissal does not affect the Veteran's receipt of VA compensation benefits at the 100 percent level.
