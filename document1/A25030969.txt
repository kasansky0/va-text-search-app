ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date than December 6, 2022 for the assignment of a 10 percent rating for bilateral medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is denied.  

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral MTSS (including consideration of entitlement to separate, compensable ratings for right and left leg MTSS) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A November 2013 legacy rating decision granted service connection for right leg MTSS and for left leg MTSS, both rated 0 percent (noncompensable) effective May 6, 2013.  The Veteran did not appeal that rating decision within one year of the November 2013 notification letter, and new and material evidence was not received within that period. 

2.  On January 12, 2022, the Veteran filed an Intent to File form.  In March 2022, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) seeking an increased rating for his service-connected right knee disability.  On the same date, he also filed a VA Form 21-526EZ (Fully Developed Claim (Compensation)) seeking service connection for multiple disabilities.  A July 2022 rating decision (which is not currently on appeal before the Board) adjudicated those claims.

3. On December 6, 2022, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) seeking increased ratings for his service-connected right leg MTSS and left leg MTSS disabilities.  The March 2023 rating decision on appeal awarded a 10 percent, combined rating for bilateral MTSS effective December 6, 2022.  

4. It was not factually ascertainable that any worsening in the service-connected bilateral MTSS disability had occurred during the one-year period before receipt of the December 6, 2022 Supplemental Claim. 

5. During the appeal period, the Veteran's service-connected bilateral MTSS was unresponsive to shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment; however, the evidence does not show that this disability was unresponsive to surgery.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The November 2013 rating decision became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.

2. December 6, 2022, the date of receipt of the Veteran's Supplemental Claim seeking an increased rating for bilateral MTSS, was the earliest possible effective date for the award of the 10 percent, combined rating for bilateral MTSS.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103 A, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5262.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral MTSS (including consideration of entitlement to separate, compensable ratings for right and left leg MTSS) have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5262.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2002 to May 2013.

In March 2023, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) assigned a combined, 10 percent evaluation for bilateral medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) effective December 6, 2022.  In February 2024, the Veteran appealed the March 2023 rating decision to the Board via a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date than December 6, 2022 for the assignment of a 10 percent rating for bilateral MTSS is denied.  

In the March 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ assigned a combined, 10 percent rating for bilateral MTSS effective December 6, 2022.  The Veteran's representative asserts that an earlier effective date of January 12, 2022 for this evaluation is warranted based on when VA received an Intent to File form.  

The effective date of an award based on a claim for increase of compensation "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). The effective date for an increased rating shall be the earliest date of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date for increased ratings shall be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).

An effective date for an increased rating may be assigned later than the date of receipt of the claim (if the evidence shows that the increase in disability actually occurred after the claim was filed), but never earlier than the date of receipt of the claim for an increase.  In general, "date of receipt" means the date on which a claim, information or evidence was received in VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).  

"Claim means a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (emphasis in original).   A supplemental claim is "any complete claim for a VA benefit on an application form prescribed by the Secretary where an initial or supplemental claim for the same or similar benefit on the same or similar basis was previously decided. (See supplemental claim; § 3.2501.)"  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(2).  

If the increase in disability occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the award is effective the date of claim. If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1), (2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F. 3d 979, 984 (Fed.Cir.2010) (stating that 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2), now § 5110(b)(3), requires that "an increase in a veteran's service-connected disability must have occurred during the one year prior to the date of the veteran's claim...to receive the benefit of an earlier effective date").

Effective March 24, 2015, VA created an "intent to file" a claim, allowing for a claimant to file a form indicating a general intent to file a claim for compensation and to preserve this date of claim by filing a formal claim for benefits within a year. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  A claimant or his or her duly authorized representative "...may indicate a claimant's desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant. Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in paragraph (a) of § 3.160, appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received."  Id.  

"If VA receives a complete claim within 1 year of the filing of an intent to file a claim that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the intent to file a claim. Only one complete claim for a benefit (e.g., compensation, pension) may be associated with each intent to file a claim for that benefit, though multiple issues may be contained within a complete claim. In the event multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within 1 year of an intent to file a claim for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii) (emphasis added).  

Although VA regulations initially had excluded modernized appeal system Supplemental Claims from the intent to file framework, the Federal Circuit invalidated this exclusion. See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110, 1147 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In this case, a November 2013 legacy rating decision granted service connection for right MTSS effective May 6, 2013 and for left MTSS medial effective May 6, 2013.  The rating decision assigned separate, initial, 0 percent (noncompensable) ratings for right MTSS and left MTSS, respectively.  The Veteran did not appeal that rating decision within one year of the November 2013 rating decision notification letter, and new and material evidence was not received within that appeal period.  Therefore, the November 2013 rating decision became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.

On January 12, 2022, the Veteran filed an Intent to File a compensation claim (VA Form 21-0996).  In March 2022 (within one year of the January 2022 Intent to File), the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) seeking an increased rating for his service-connected right knee disability.  On the same day in March 2022, he also filed a VA Form 21-526EZ (Fully Developed Claim (Compensation)) seeking service connection for multiple disabilities.  A July 2022 rating decision, which is not currently on appeal before the Board, adjudicated the March 2022 claims.

On December 6, 2022, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) seeking an increased rating for bilateral MTSS.  

The Board finds that the March 2023 rating decision on appeal properly awarded the 10 percent, combined rating for bilateral MTSS effective December 6, 2022.  The Veteran's representative is correct that VA received an Intent to File on January 12, 2022.  However, only one complete claim for a benefit (e.g., compensation) may be associated with this Intent to File.   The AOJ already properly had associated the January 12, 2022 Intent to File with the claims received in March 2022.  Since the March 2022 claims were the first claims filed within one year of the January 12, 2022 Intent to File, the AOJ correctly did not associate the subsequent, December 6, 2022 Supplemental Claim with that same Intent to File.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii).  

Moreover, there is no evidence showing that an increase in the Veteran's service-connected bilateral MTSS disability was factually ascertainable during the one year period before he filed the December 2022 claim.  There is no evidence during that one-year "look back" period suggesting that the Veteran's service-connected bilateral MTSS was unresponsive to surgery as required for a higher rating under DC 5262.  (The Veteran had an April 2022 VA knee examination, which did not address the nature or severity of the service-connected bilateral MTSS disability; rather, this examination focused on his separate, service-connected right knee disability).   Therefore, an earlier effective date than December 6, 2022 for the assignment of the 10 percent, combined rating for the service-connected bilateral MTSS disability is not warranted during the one-year "look-back" period.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1), (2); Gaston, 605 F. 3d at 984.

In summary, the March 2023 rating decision properly awarded the earliest legally and factually possible effective date of December 6, 2022, the date of receipt of the December 6, 2022 Supplemental Claim, for the assignment of the 10 percent combined disability rating for bilateral MTSS.  Therefore, the appeal is denied.  Since the evidence is not at least in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply. 

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral MTSS (including consideration of entitlement to separate, compensable ratings for right and left MTSS) is denied.

Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran has been in receipt of a combined, 10 percent disability rating for his service-connected bilateral MTSS under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5262.  He seeks a higher rating.  Specifically, his representative contends that entitlement to separate, compensable ratings of at least 10 percent for right and the left leg MTSS, respectively, are warranted (with consideration of the bilateral factor).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5262 (emphasis added), a higher, 20 percent rating is warranted for MTSS (shin splints) when there is involvement of one lower extremity "[r]equiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment..."  A higher, 30 percent rating warranted for MTSS (shin splints) when there is involvement of both lower extremities "[r]equiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment..."  See id.  In summary, to warrant a higher rating under DC 5262 applying either the 20 percent or the 30 percent rating criteria, the evidence must show that the service-connected MTSS condition is unresponsive to surgery.  See id.  

Here, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's bilateral MTSS condition was unresponsive to surgery (in either leg) at any relevant time during the appeal period.  Although the February 2023 VA examiner noted this condition was unresponsive to shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment bilaterally, the examiner notably did not indicate that this condition was unresponsive to surgery in either leg.  The examiner noted no surgical procedures of either the right knee or the left knee.  There is no other evidence of record suggesting that this specific, express requirement for a higher rating has been met or more nearly approximated here (and neither the Veteran nor his representative has contended or cited evidence suggesting that this is the case).  

The Board considered the Veteran's representative's contention that entitlement to separate, compensable ratings for right leg MTSS and left leg MTSS, respectively, are warranted (with consideration of the bilateral factor).  However, each available disability rating under DC 5262 expressly considers whether involvement of one or both lower extremities is required.  For example, the Veteran's current, 10 percent rating for bilateral MTSS expressly accounts for involvement of "one or both lower extremities."  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5262 (emphasis added).  Even considering the bilateral lower extremity involvement of the Veteran's service-connected shin splints, a higher rating is unwarranted under DC 5262 because there is no evidence that this condition has been unresponsive to surgery, as noted above.  

To the extent that the Veteran's representative implicitly suggests that the pre-February 2021 version of DC 5262 may warrant entitlement to separate compensable ratings for right and left leg MTSS, respectively, that version of DC 5262 does not apply here.  If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 34 (2000).  However, a regulation may not be applied retroactively unless the regulation is intended to be retroactive.  See Ervin v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 318, 322 (2011) (citing Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). When a "claim implicates a statute or regulation enacted during the pendency of that claim, the first task is to determine whether the statute or regulation expressly speaks to its temporal reach." Id.  If so, then VA must "apply the regulation as indicated by the language of the regulation." Id.  

Here, 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5262 was amended effective February 7, 2021.  See 85 Fed. Reg. 230 (Nov. 30, 2020).  The Veteran filed the increased rating claim for MTSS on appeal in December 2022.  The effective date of this regulatory amendment did not occur during the pendency of the claim or subsequent appeal.  Therefore, only the post-February 2021, current version of DC 5262 applies here. 

In summary, entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral MTSS is denied.  Since the evidence is not at least in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply.

Finally, neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues; nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 370 (2017).
