ORDER

An effective date prior to May 11, 2016, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's May 2016 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, VA Form 21-526EZ, seeking service connection for sleep apnea was received by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on May 11, 2016.

2. A November 2020 evaluation from S. Di Pascuale, M.D., relates that the diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea was related to the service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on November 30, 2020.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to May 11, 2016, for the award of service connection for sleep apnea have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from February 1988 to October 1988.

In September 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction granted service connection for sleep apnea; assigned a 50 percent rating for that disability; and effectuated the award as of May 11, 2016.  In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review Docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2021 Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, and submit or identify this evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Effective Date for Award of Service Connection for Sleep Apnea

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Generally, the effective date for an award of service connection is the day after service separation or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if the claim is received within one year of the date of separation from service.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

The term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation.  However, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought.  This is determined on a "facts found" basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).  An effective date generally can be no earlier than the "facts found."  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011).  These "facts found" include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested.  Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the Agency of Original Jurisdiction receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers.  McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.  It is possible that a particular piece of evidence demonstrates that the Veteran suffered from the symptoms of a disability or rating level earlier than the date of the examination, opinion, or diagnosis.  DeLisio, 25 Vet. App. at 56.

The Veteran asserts that an effective date of April 4, 2014, is warranted for the grant of service connection for "sleep apnea associated with PTSD due to military sexual trauma" as the service-connected PTSD "reasonably encompassed a claim for complications of PTSD - including sleep apnea which existed at the time."  Service connection for PTSD has been established as of April 4, 2014.

A May 2014 VA clinical record conveys that "home sleep study reviewed" and an assessment of "moderate sleep apnea" was advanced.

In May 2016, the Veteran filed an Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, VA Form 21-526EZ, seeking service connection for sleep apnea.  In May 2016, the Veteran submitted a Sleep Apnea Disability Benefits Questionnaire, VA Form 21-0960L-2, dated December 10, 2014 by "J. Harris."  Dr. Harris commented that an April 2014 "Novasom sleep study" revealed "moderate sleep apnea syndrome."  Dr. Harris noted that "high blood pressure" and "PTSD" were additional diagnoses that pertained to the Veteran's diagnosis of sleep apnea.

The report of a January 2020 VA sleep apnea examination states that the Veteran "reports this condition began in 1988" due to in-service trauma and she had "years of snoring, restless sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, and fatigue."  She was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea.  The examiner commented that the Veteran has been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea since the year of 2014.

A November 2020 evaluation from S. Pascuale, M.D., received in December 2020 concludes that "it is more likely than not that the Veteran's sleep disorder is a consequence of her service-connected PTSD condition, as scientific evidence relates pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for OSA development in individuals with PTSD."

In the September 2022 VA Form 10182, the Veteran's attorney advances that under Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021), "the effective date for sleep apnea should be no later than the effective date for PTSD."  The attorney states that "[t]he May 2021 Board decision granted sleep apnea as secondary to PTSD and conceded that sleep apnea is a complication of PTSD.  Accordingly, [the Veteran's] initial claim for PTSD, on April 4, 2014, reasonably encompassed a claim for complications of PTSD - including sleep apnea which existed at that time."

The effective date assigned for a secondary service-connected disability does not relate back to the filing date of a prior claim for the antecedent disability.  Ellington v. Nicholson, 22 Vet. App. 141 (2007).  The effective date assigned for a secondary service-connected condition does not have to be the same as the effective date for the underlying condition.  Ross v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 528 (2008).  The plain meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) "is and has always been to afford secondarily service-connected conditions the same treatment (no more or less favorable treatment) as the underlying service-connected conditions for all determinations."  Roper v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 173, 181 (2006).  This includes the assignment of an effective date.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has repeatedly rejected the argument that a disability service connected as secondary to an underlying service-connected disability be entitled to the effective date of the underlying disability.  See Manzanares v. Shulkin, 863 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2017); Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  The Federal Circuit has found that there is nothing in the history of 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) to suggest that a claim for secondary service connection should be treated as part of a claim for primary service connection.  Manzanares, 863 F.3d at 1374. 

The effective date assigned for a secondarily service-connected condition is governed by § 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The governing regulations dictate that the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later, and the Board is bound by that authority.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  VA is required to identify, develop, and adjudicate related claims for secondary service connection for complications arising from the primary disability that are "reasonably raised" during the adjudication of an increased rating claim for the primary disability.  See Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 103, 110 (2022); Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 191 (2021).

The record reflects that the Veteran was initially diagnosed with sleep apnea in 2014.  The Veteran's May 2016 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, VA Form 21-526EZ, seeking service connection for sleep apnea was received by VA on May 11, 2016.  The November 2020 private evaluation concluded that the service-connected PTSD caused the diagnosed sleep apnea.  The date of receipt of the claim is May 11, 2016.  The date entitlement arose is November 30, 2020.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's assertion that the award of service connection for sleep apnea should be effectuated as of April 4, 2014, to be unpersuasive.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that an effective date prior to May 11, 2016, for the award of service connection for sleep apnea is not warranted.
