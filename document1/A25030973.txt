REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the Army from November 1989 to December 2009.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2021 decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the February 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on August 22, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2021 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Rating Reductions

When reduction is considered warranted by the evidence and would result in reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made, certain procedural guidelines must be followed: first, there must be a rating action proposing the reduction; then the Veteran must be given 60 days to submit additional evidence and 30 days to request a predetermination hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). Once these predetermination procedures have been completed, a final action using the evidence of record will be taken. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), (i).

A rating reduction is not proper unless a veteran's disability shows actual improvement in his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. See Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 349 (2000). In considering the propriety of a reduction, the Board must focus on the evidence available to the AOJ at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered in the context of determining whether actual improvement was demonstrated. Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 281-82 (1992). The Veteran need not demonstrate the retention of the higher evaluation is warranted; rather, VA must show that the reduction was warranted. See Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 418 (1993). 

In this case, in an August 2017 rating decision, the AOJ granted the Veteran 100 percent evaluation for PTSD, a 20 percent evaluation for left great toe degenerative arthritis and hallux valgus, and a 20 percent evaluation for right great toe degenerative arthritis and hallux valgus, effective May 16, 2017. The Veteran underwent VA medical examinations in September and December 2020. Following these examinations, the AOJ proposed in December 2020 to reduce the Veteran's rating for PTSD from 100 percent to 50 percent; the rating for left great toe degenerative arthritis and hallux valgus from 20 percent to 10 percent; and for right great toe degenerative arthritis and hallux valgus from 20 percent to 10 percent. The AOJ also proposed to discontinue the Veteran's entitlement to SMC. In a letter in connection with this proposed decision, the AOJ advised the Veteran that he had 60 days to submit additional evidence and 30 days to request a pre-determination hearing. The Veteran did not request a hearing or submit additional evidence, and in February 2021, the AOJ issued a rating decision implementing the proposed reductions and discontinuation effective May 1, 2021.

Based on the foregoing, the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) have been satisfied. The question thus becomes whether the reductions themselves were proper. In this case, the 100 percent rating for the PTSD and the 20 percent rating for bilateral toe disabilities had been in effect since May 16, 2017, and thus for less than five years as of the effective date of the reduction. Thus, a reduction in rating required a reexamination disclosing improvement, physical or mental. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt will be given to the appellant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 777-79 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. The reduction in the disability rating for PTSD from 100 percent to 50 percent, effective May 1, 2021, was improper; the 100 percent evaluation is restored.

The February 2021 AOJ decision reduced the Veteran's rating for PTSD from 100 percent to 50 percent based on purported medical improvement. On appeal, the Veteran contends that his PTSD had not in fact improved and that the reduction was not proper. For the reasons that follow, the Board agrees. 

As an initial matter, in addition to the general rules applicable to rating reductions, the Veteran's prior 100 percent rating for PTSD receives additional protection. Because the Veteran's PTSD was rated as totally disabling, that rating cannot be reduced, in the absence of clear error, without an examination showing material improvement under the ordinary conditions of life. 38 C.F.R. § 3.343(a). 

In this case, the August 2017 AOJ decision granted a 100 percent rating based on a June 2017 VA medical examination. At that time, the Veteran had a diagnosis of PTSD and no other mental disabilities. The Veteran lived alone and was divorced but had a girlfriend. He reported no hobbies or close friends. The Veteran was working as a contractor at Fort Benning, and he had been written up twice for disrespecting his supervisor. He was not taking any psychiatric medications and was paranoid about drugs. The Veteran thought about suicide on a weekly basis and reported paranoia, olfactory hallucinations, and difficulty sleeping.

Based on this examination, the examiner endorsed symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impaired abstract thinking, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, suicidal ideation, impaired impulse control, and persistent delusions or hallucinations. The examiner opined that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and/or mood.

By comparison, the February 2021 AOJ decision reducing the Veteran's evaluation relied on a September 2020 VA examination. At that time, the Veteran had a diagnosis of PTSD and no other mental disabilities. The Veteran described himself as an introvert without much of a social life and reported irritability in social situations. He avoided crowds and groups but did have a friend. The Veteran was still working as a contractor at Fort Benning. The Veteran still reported taking no medications. In addition, he struggled with loud noises and stated that the CPAP he used for his sleep apnea "puts [him] back in the Army" two or three times a week. 

Based on this examination, the examiner noted no change in the Veteran's service-connected diagnosis. The examiner endorsed symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, flattened affect, and disturbances of motivation and mood, and described the Veteran as irritable and circumspect. Overall, the examiner opined that the Veteran experienced occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

At the August 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that his PTSD symptoms made it hard for him to sleep and that, when he was asleep, he felt like he was "back at war." He described experiencing "super depression" and said he did not leave the house for days on end and sometimes went four or five days without bathing or showering. Socially, the Veteran described having lost trust in people, not keeping friends or seeing family, becoming irritated on a daily basis, and getting into verbal arguments all the time. He reported crying spells three or four times per week and suicidal thoughts daily. In addition, the Veteran described trouble concentrating and maintaining attention and poor memory for names and locations. He also reported feeling like someone was in the room with him or was going to pop up from around a corner. Occupationally, the Veteran described being fired twice from the same job, once for flipping a desk in an argument and another time for falling asleep on the job. Overall, the Veteran said he did not feel his PTSD had improved since 2021.

Subsequent to the hearing, the Veteran submitted a private questionnaire completed by VA treatment provider A.F. in July 2024. At that time, the Veteran had diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder. He reported living with his girlfriend of twelve years but being detached, distant, and emotionally unavailable. The Veteran said he isolated and avoided public places and was unable to socialize due to paranoid ideation. He further reported poor concentration and being easily started, triggered, or agitated. The Veteran described being unemployed since being terminated as a result of PTSD symptoms and interpersonal conflicts. A.F. noted that the Veteran dissociated to place and time when triggered, was hypervigilant, and became confused, agitated, or angry. The Veteran neglected self-care and had frequent panic attacks with a racing heart and feeling hot and sweaty. During counseling, A.F. noted, the Veteran stared at the door and easily jumped at surrounding noise. The Veteran had developed obsessive rituals such as patrolling his perimeters before leaving home, and ruminating thoughts interfered with his ability to comprehend or process information. 

Based on this examination, A.F. noted no signs of improvement, poor prognosis, and progressive worsening of the Veteran's disability. A.F. endorsed symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks more than once a week, near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss and impairment of short- and long-term memory, memory loss for names of close relatives, occupation, or name, flattened affect, circumstantial speech, impaired judgment, gross impairment in thought processes, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful situations, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, suicidal ideation, obsession rituals, impaired impulse control, spatial disorientation, neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, and disorientation to time and place. Overall, A.F. opined that the Veteran experienced total occupational and social impairment.

Considering the record as a whole, and resolving reasonable doubts in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the evidence does not demonstrate a material improvement under the ordinary conditions of life. Admittedly, the September 2020 VA examination reflects less severe symptomatology than the June 2017 VA examination and thus is at least consistent with improvement in the Veteran's PTSD. However, the Veteran's competent and credible hearing testimony and A.F.'s July 2024 examination weigh against a finding that the Veteran's PTSD materially improved under the ordinary conditions of life, and such favorable post-reduction evidence is relevant. Dofflemyer, 2 Vet. App. at 281-82.

Weighing the September 2020 VA examination against the hearing testimony and the July 2024 examination, the Board concludes that the evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's PTSD materially improved under the ordinary conditions of life. Mindful that the burden is on VA to demonstrate that a reduction is proper, and resolving reasonable doubts in the Veteran's favor, Lynch, 21 F.4th at 777-79, the Board finds that the record does not establish material improvement under the ordinary conditions of life. 

The reduction in the Veteran's evaluation in PTSD was therefore improper, and the prior 100 percent rating is restored.

2. The reduction in the disability rating for left great toe degenerative arthritis and hallux valgus from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective May 1, 2021, was improper; the 20 percent rating is restored. 

3. The reduction in the disability rating for right great toe degenerative arthritis and hallux valgus from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective May 1, 2021, was improper; the 20 percent rating is restored. 

The February 2021 AOJ decision reduced the Veteran's rating for left great toe degenerative arthritis and hallux valgus from 20 percent to 10 percent and the Veteran's rating for right great toe degenerative arthritis and hallux valgus from 20 percent to 10 percent. On appeal, the Veteran asserts that there has been no sustained improvement in these disabilities and that the reductions were thus not proper. For the reasons that follow, the Board agrees that the reductions were not proper.

As an initial clarification, the requirement cited by the Veteran that evidence demonstrate "sustained improvement" is not applicable in this case. That requirement appears in 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a), and the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a) do not apply to ratings in effect for less than five years, such as those at issue here. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c). Rather, a reduction requires a reexamination disclosing improvement, physical or mental. Id. That said, a rating reduction is not proper unless a veteran's disability shows actual improvement in his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. See Faust, 13 Vet. App. at 349.

Turning to the evidence, the August 2017 AOJ decision granted a 20 percent evaluation for each of these disabilities based on a June 2017 VA examination. At that time, the examiner documented bilateral hallux valgus and degenerative arthritis, with pain in the bilateral great toe and swelling. The Veteran treated with patches, Naproxen, and braces that did not provide relief. The examiner described the Veteran's hallux valgus symptoms as mild to moderate bilaterally and the pain as moderately severe bilaterally in the great toes. The Veteran also had difficulty with prolonged standing and walking.

By comparison, the February 2021 AOJ decision reduced the evaluations to 10 percent each based on a December 2020 examination. At that examination, the Veteran reported walking four to five miles per day at work, having flare-ups four to five times a year during which he could not ambulate, and a progression or worsening of his disability since onset. The examiner described mild to moderate symptoms of hallux valgus on both sides, with the right worse than the left, and mild arthritis of both feet. The examiner also documented swelling and deformity in both feet, worse on the right, and pain on non-weight-bearing on the right. The Veteran also had disturbance with locomotion and interference with standing; prolonged standing on his feet caused bilateral arthritic pain, forcing him to "lay up." The examiner described the Veteran's condition as involving severe incapacitating flare-ups of hallux valgus four to five times per year and opined, "It is more likely than not that the severity was underestimated at the time of his 2009 exam and has gotten progressively worse."

At the Board hearing, the Veteran testified experiencing pain on a daily basis in both feet, sometimes requiring medication just to bear it. He reported he could walk five minutes before needing to sit and could stand in one position for about five minutes at a time. Both his great toes were stiff, swollen, and painful, and he did not think either toe had improved at all since 2021.

Considering the record as a whole, and resolving reasonable doubts in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the evidence does not show actual improvement in the Veteran's ability to function in the ordinary conditions of life and work. Although the December 2020 VA examination reflects an assessment of "mild" arthritis rather than moderately severe arthritic pain, the specific symptoms described by the December 2020 examiner do not appear to have improved since the June 2017 examination. Indeed, the examiner's description of severe, incapacitating flare-ups four to five times a year seems if anything more limiting than the symptoms described in June 2017. 

Considering this evidence along with the Veteran's competent and credible hearing testimony, the Board concludes that that the evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's left and right great toe disabilities actually improved under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Mindful that the burden is on VA to demonstrate that a reduction is proper, and resolving reasonable doubts in the Veteran's favor, Lynch, 21 F.4th at 777-79, the Board finds that the record does not show actual improvement under the ordinary conditions of life and work. 

The reductions were thus improper, and the prior 20 percent evaluations are restored.

4. Entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is restored.

SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is payable where a veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total and has additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i)(1).

The February 2021 AOJ decision discontinued the Veteran's entitlement to SMC based on the reduction of his evaluation for PTSD. However, as explained above, that reduction was not proper, and the 100 percent rating for that disability is restored. 

In light of the that restoration and the others in this decision, the Veteran has a single service-connected disability, PTSD, rated as total. He also has the following additional disabilities: sleep apnea, rated at 50 percent; left knee strain, rated at 10 percent; left ankle arthritis, rated at 10 percent; left great toe degenerative arthritis and hallux valgus, rated at 20 percent; right great toe degenerative arthritis and hallux valgus, rated at 20 percent; and several other disabilities rated as noncompensable. These other service-connected disabilities, separately and distinctly from the Veteran's PTSD, are rated at a combined 70 percent. The Veteran thus meets the criteria for SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). 

Entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is restored.
