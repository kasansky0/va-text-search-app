REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from September 1985 to September 2005.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. §?3.2400(a)(1). The AMA applies to all initial decisions issued after February 19, 2019. 

The present matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from July 2023, November 2023, and February 2024 rating decisions issued by VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Accordingly, this decision is subject to the AMA.? 

In January 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995: Supplemental Claim Application for his back, hip, knee, and OSA conditions. In a July 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been received to re-adjudicate the claim for OSA and denied service connection.? In a November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been received to re-adjudicate the claim for a back condition and denied service connection. In a February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been received to re-adjudicate the claim for hip and knee conditions and denied service connection.?  

Next, the Veteran timely appealed the July 2023, November 2023 and February 2024 rating decisions to the Board in a May 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. Based on the Veteran's selection of the direct review docket, the Board may only consider evidence on record at the time of the July 2023 rating decision on appeal for the OSA condition, may only consider evidence on record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision on appeal for the back condition, and may only consider the evidence on record at the time of the February 2024 rating decision on appeal for the hip and knee conditions.

Service Connection 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 38 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). The absence of any one element will result in a denial of service connection.????? 

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has held that "[l]ay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional." Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("[T]he Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence").?? 

Service connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).?? 

Service connection may alternatively be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  

Service connection may alternatively be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Secondary service connection may also be established for a disorder which is aggravated by a service-connected disability; compensation may be provided for the degree of disability (but only that degree) over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation. See 38?C.F.R. § 3.310(b); Allen v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?374 (1995).?? 

In order to prevail on the issue of secondary service connection, the record must show: (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) medical nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11?Vet. App.?509, 512 (1998); see also Allen, supra.?? 

Service connection must be considered on the basis of the places, types, and circumstances of a Veteran's service as shown by his or her service records, the official history of each organization in which he or she served, his or her medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); and see Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).????? 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §?3.102.?

1. Entitlement to service connection for lower back pain (back disability)

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hip pain (hip disability)

3. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee pain (knee disability)

The Veteran seeks service connection for his back, hip, and knee disabilities and maintains that these disabilities were caused by his service. The Board agrees and finds the elements of service connection on a direct basis have been satisfied. 

With respect to current disability, the AOJ rendered a favorable finding in the November 2023 rating decision that the Veteran has a current disability of degenerative arthritis in his back. The AOJ rendered a favorable finding in the February 2024 rating decision that the Veteran has a current disability of bilateral hip strain as well as degenerative arthritis of the left knee and status post, right knee fracture and degenerative arthritis of the right knee. The Board is bound by these findings. 8 U.S.C. §§ 5104(b)(4), 5104A. 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). Accordingly, the first element of service connection, a current disability, is satisfied.

With regard to in-service incurrence, the Board finds the in-service event that can be attributed to the development of the Veteran's claimed disabilities is the performance of the Veteran's occupation as a helicopter mechanic over the course of his military career. Among other specified job duties, the Veteran was a T-64 Turboprop Engine and Propeller IMA Mechanic for 19 years and 1 month. See DD214. To support this finding, each of the September 2022 VA medical opinions for the back, hip, and knee disabilities trace the development of these disabilities directly to the Veteran's employment as a helicopter mechanic. Thus, the Board finds that in-service incurrence is established.  

With respect to a nexus, the September 2022 VA medical opinion provided a negative nexus for service connection of the Veteran's back, hip, and knee as secondary to his service-connected pes planus. As rationale, the examiner found no objective evidence to support that the conditions were a result of the Veteran's service-connected pes planus. Additionally, the examiner noted that post service treatment records did not document any gross alterations in the Veteran's gait, which would be necessary for a disability of another joint to be caused by pes planus and/or plantar fasciitis. In rendering this opinion, the examiner concluded that the more likely etiology is Veteran's post-service job as a helicopter mechanic. However, the Board notes that the only time the Veteran was employed as a helicopter mechanic was while he was in service. Thus, the examiner has inadvertently provided a positive nexus for direct service connection between the Veteran's in-service occupation and his back, hip, and knee disabilities. Furthermore, the Board finds that the conclusion is supported by adequate rationale and affords these opinions high probative weight. As such, the Board finds that a nexus is established between the Veteran's back, hip, and knee conditions and the in-service event. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that all three elements of service connection have been met and service connection for the Veteran's back, hip, and knee disabilities is granted. 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a), (d).

4. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)

The Veteran contends that he has a diagnosis of OSA, that VA has conceded an in-service event, and he seeks service connection for this condition. 

With respect to current disability, the AOJ rendered a favorable finding in the July 2023 rating decision that the Veteran has a current disability of OSA. The Board is bound by this finding. 8 U.S.C. §§ 5104(b)(4), 5104A. 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). Accordingly, the first element of service connection, a current disability, is satisfied.

With regard to in-service incurrence, VA has conceded the Veteran's participation in a toxic risk exposure activity (TERA) in the July 2023 rating decision. Thus, the in-service incurrence element of service connection is established. 

With respect to a nexus, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his TERA participation in July 2023. The examiner provided a negative nexus opinion between the Veteran's OSA and TERA participation. As rationale, the examiner pointed to the Veteran's weight gain in service and his obesity before the examiner remarked that there are no scientific studies making direct relationship between chemical exposure and the development of OSA and that the PACT Act of 2022 does not consider OSA as a presumptive service condition. The examiner considered all substances to which the Veteran was exposed in forming the opinion. The Board finds that the conclusion reached is supported by adequate rationale and affords the opinion high probative weight. 

The Veteran was also afforded a VA examination for direct service connection in September 2022, where the examiner opined that the most common cause of OSA is due to overweight or obesity according to the medical literature, and a negative nexus between the Veteran's OSA and his service was provided. The examiner stated that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's OSA was incurred from the USS Tripoli mine explosion, asbestos, and toxic fumes. The opinion concurs with the July 2023 TERA opinion in its rationale, and the conclusion is supported by adequate rationale. As such, the Board finds this opinion highly probative, and also finds, based on the two VA opinions, that a nexus is not established between the in-service incurrence and the current disability. 

In sum, the evidence is persuasively against the claim, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable. Accordingly, the Board finds that the elements of service connection have not been met, and service connection for the Veteran's OSA is denied.
