ISSUE

Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to July 1, 2023, for the grant of an apportionment of the Veteran's VA disability compensation benefits.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to July 1, 2023, for the grant of an apportionment of the Veteran's VA disability compensation benefits, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from May 1989 to March 1993, during Peacetime and the Gulf War Era.

The appellant is the Veteran's spouse.

This matter comes before the Board from a December 27, 2023, apportionment decision which granted an apportionment of the Veteran's VA disability compensation benefits to the appellant and assigning an effective date of July 1, 2023. The appellant filed a timely VA Form 10182 on February 15, 2024, and requested the Direct Review docket. 

Entitlement to earlier effective date, prior to July 1, 2023, for the grant of an apportionment of the Veteran's VA disability compensation benefits, is remanded.

The appellant contends that she is entitled to an effective date of February 2023, for the grant of an apportionment of the Veteran's VA disability compensation benefits. 

VA regulations provide for two types of apportionments. A "general" apportionment may be paid under the circumstances set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.450. Specifically, the law provides that all or any part of a veteran's VA compensation benefits may be apportioned if a veteran is not residing with his or her spouse or children, and a veteran is not reasonably discharging his or her responsibility for the support of the spouse or children. 38 U.S.C. § 5307; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.450, 3.452. Notably, it is not necessary for the claimant to establish the existence of hardship in order to obtain an apportionment under 38 C.F.R. § 3.450. See Hall v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 294 (1993).

The second type of apportionment is a "special" apportionment, which may be paid under the circumstances set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.451. That regulation provides that, without regard to any other provision regarding apportionment, where hardship is shown to exist, compensation may be apportioned between a veteran and his or her dependents on the basis of the facts of the individual case as long as it does not cause undue hardship to the other persons in interest.

In determining the basis for a special apportionment, consideration is to be given to such factors as the amount of VA benefits payable, other income and resources of a veteran and those dependents on whose behalf the apportionment is claimed, and the special needs of a veteran, his or her dependents, and the apportionment claimants. 38 C.F.R. § 3.451 provides further that apportionment of more than 50 percent of a veteran's benefits is ordinarily considered to constitute undue hardship on him or her, while apportionment of less than 20 percent of his or her benefits is ordinarily considered insufficient to constitute a reasonable basis for any apportionee. A veteran's benefits may be apportioned if a veteran is not residing with his spouse or children, and a claim for apportionment is filed for or on behalf of the spouse or children. 38 C.F.R. § 3.452 (a). A veteran's benefits will not be apportioned where the total benefit payable to the disabled person does not permit payment of a reasonable amount to any apportionee. 38 C.F.R. § 3.458 (a).

Congress did not specifically address the proper effective date for apportionment claims in section 5110 of Title 38 of the United States Code, and rather left the task to the Secretary of VA via rulemaking authority. See 38 U.S.C. § 501 (a). Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (e), the effective date for an original apportionment claim will be assigned in accordance with the facts found. On other than original claims, the effective date of apportionment benefits is the first day of the month following the month in which the claim was received, subject to a caveat: if payments to a veteran are interrupted, apportionment will be effective the first day of the month following the date of the last payment if a claim for apportionment is received within 1 year after that date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (e)(1).

The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply in apportionment cases because it is impossible to give the benefit of the doubt to a veteran and a claimant simultaneously. Elias v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 259 (1997).

Historically, the RO granted the Veteran's claim for additional dependency benefits for the appellant effective July 29, 2022. The record shows the Veteran was hospitalized in a VA Mental Health Rehabilitation Treatment Program from March 9, 2023, to April 11, 2023. VA treatment records from his hospitalization indicate that the Veteran was homeless, and unemployed. On June 16, 2023, the appellant submitted a claim for entitlement to an apportionment of the Veteran's VA benefits and a VA Form 21-0788 reporting financial information. On July 19, 2023, the appellant submitted a statement that she was experiencing financial hardship. On November 17, 2023, VA sent a letter to the Veteran requesting that he send a statement as to whether he was still married to the appellant and any supporting evidence such as a divorce decree. The Board notes that the record does not contain a response from the Veteran, nor is there a VA Form 21-0788 from the Veteran providing his financial information. On December 27, 2023, the RO issued a Special Apportionment Decision granting a special apportionment to the appellant based on financial hardship, effective July 1, 2023, the first of the month following the date of the apportionment claim.

The effective date of the grant of an apportionment is dependent on the facts found. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (e). The Board finds that further development of the evidence is necessary to determine the appropriate effective date of the apportionment. The question of whether the grant of an earlier effective date, which could result in a debt for the Veteran, would result in financial hardship to the Veteran is at issue. As stated above, VA medical evidence reflects that the Veteran was homeless and unemployed. The record does not contain any evidence from the Veteran regarding his financial status. In this circumstance of determining the appropriate effective date of the apportionment, the role of VA is to determine whether financial hardship existed with respect to either party. The record does not contain a VA Form 21-0788 from the Veteran, nor is there any information in the record regarding the Veteran's monthly expenses and financial status. Although the appellant submitted a VA form 21-0788 and provided information regarding the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt cannot be applied to the appellant, and it is necessary for the Veteran to provide his own VA Form 21-0788 or other documentation of his income and expenses including debt.

Because there is no evidence of record showing the Veteran's financial status, whether his monthly expenses exceed his income, or if he would experience hardship if an earlier effective date for the apportionment were to be granted, the Board finds that this matter is not ripe for appellate review. Moreover, evidence necessary to make a determination of the Veteran's financial status, necessary to assign a proper effective date, was not adequately developed at the time of the RO's December 2023, apportionment decision on appeal. As such, remand is required to obtain necessary financial information from the Veteran. Further, the RO did not receive a response from the Veteran after requesting evidence of marital status. While the case is in remand status, the Veteran should be provided the opportunity to submit this evidence as well.

As an additional matter, the record reflects that the parties were provided with a Board Docketing letter on February 29, 2024, informing them that the appeal was placed on the Direct Review docket and that additional evidence submitted with the appellant's February 15, 2023, VA Form 10182 would not be considered. The letter also informed the parties that a change of docket could be requested by submitting a new VA Form 10182 and requesting the Evidence Submission or Hearing dockets. The letter further informed the parties that requests to change dockets must be filed within 60 days from the date that the Board received the VA Form 10182 which was already submitted, or one year from the date of the VA decision being appealed. 

On April 26, 2024, the appellant submitted a request to change dockets and a new VA Form 10182 reflecting a request for the Evidence Submission docket. On August 1, 2024, an AMA notification letter was sent to the appellant stating that the Board did not receive her April 26, 2024, VA 10182 in time. The letter clarified that the rule, specifically pertaining to simultaneously contested claims, is that a docket change request must be filed within 60 days from the date of the decision.

The Board acknowledges that the appellant relied on incorrect information provided in the February 29, 2024, Board Docketing letter and believed that her request for a docket change was timely. However, the appellant's docket change request was denied as untimely. Therefore, while this appeal for an earlier effective date of the grant of apportionment is in remand status, the parties should be allowed to submit additional evidence for consideration by the RO.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Request the Veteran to provide income and expense information for the appeal period, along with any supporting documentation. The Veteran should be informed of the importance of this information and that it is essential to understand the parties' finances in adjudicating the proper effective date for the grant of the apportionment.

2. While the claim is in remand status, allow the parties 90 days for the submission of additional evidence.

3. Ensure full compliance with contested claims procedures, to include notifying both parties that if a disagreement still remains, a new VA Form 10182 is required to appeal the decision within 60 days.
