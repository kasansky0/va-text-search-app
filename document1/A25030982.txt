ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The appellant does not have a current diagnosis of a tinnitus disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant served on active duty with the United States Marine Corps from May 1974 to June 1974.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the June 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Generally, establishing service connection requires competent evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis when a disability is shown to be proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

The Board has reviewed the entire record but will only discuss the evidence necessary to explain its decision.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence); see Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the appellant).

After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining, is to be resolved in favor of the appellant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.  If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the claim is to be denied.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit clarified in Lynch v. McDonough that the proper standard of review is whether the factors are in an "approximate balance."  Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021).  Lynch held that the appellant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in an approximate balance or "nearly equal" and does not require the evidence to be in exact equipoise.  Id. 

Service connection for tinnitus is denied.

The appellant asserts entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

Tinnitus is a chronic disease under 38 U.S.C. § 1101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Thus, the Board must consider whether it was noted as chronic in service or manifested to a compensable degree in service or within the applicable presumptive period or continuity of symptomatology has existed since service.

In March 2024, the appellant received a VA examination.  The appellant did not report recurrent tinnitus, and the audiologist opined that the appellant did not have tinnitus.  She stated that tinnitus was not diagnosed.

In considering the appellant's appeal, the Board reviewed the rating decision and found the RO made a finding favorable to the appellant.  The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during your service.  Exposure to military noise is conceded.  As this favorable finding binds the Board, the second element of service connection is satisfied.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The Board conducted a holistic review of the appellant's military records.  These records did not contain a complaint, diagnosis or treatment for tinnitus. 

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997).  The current disability requirement is satisfied when a claimant "has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim."  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); see also Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143-44 (1992).

Such an absence exists in this matter.  The audiologist reported the appellant does not have a current diagnosis of tinnitus.  The competent and credible medical records do not reveal evidence of a complaint, diagnosis, or treatment for tinnitus disorder.  They also do not reveal evidence of a complaint, diagnosis, or treatment for tinnitus during or any time after the appellant's military service.   There also is no competent and credible evidence of a chronic tinnitus condition. 

In the absence of a current disability, a discussion of the nexus, or link, between a current disability and the in-service disease or injury is not required. 

As such, the Board finds the greater weight of the competent and credible evidence weighs against the appellant's claim.  The Board finds the record contains no such evidence favoring the claim.  In reaching this decision, the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt; however, as the most persuasive evidence of record is against the appellant's claim, the doctrine is not for application.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  For the reasons stated above, the Board must deny the appellant's claim.
