REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2001 to June 2001, from February 2003 to September 2004, and from January 2005 to June 2010.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran contends her active service dates should be from January 2001 to December 2011 and from June 2012 to December 2016.  However, the Board notes that those service periods also include her inactive service while a part of the National Guard of Alaska and Army Reserve.  See December 2011 National Guard Report of Separation and Record of Service Form 22; December 2016 National Guard Report of Separation and Record of Service Form 22.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

On the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran listed a December 2022 Higher-Level Review rating decision and January 2022 initial rating decision as the decisions on appeal for the claimed service connection for GERD.  The Veteran also appealed service connection for Hashimoto's disease and hypothyroidism from the May 2017 rating decision.  However, the Board notes that these rating decisions are all outside of the one-year appeal period window from the notice of the rating decision, and the December 2022 HLR rating decision is not a final decision as it returned the issue of GERD back to the AOJ because of a duty-to-assist error for an examination and further development.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203(b).  As the Veteran has not provided good cause for an untimely NOD, the Board finds that the issues of service connection for Hashimoto's disease and hypothyroidism are not on appeal and will not be further addressed in this decision.  Moreover, the Board finds the January 2022 initial and December 2022 HLR rating decisions that addressed service connection for GERD are also not appeal.

However, following the December 2022 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction denied service connection for GERD in an October 2023 supplemental rating decision.  As the one-year period to select a different review option for the October 2023 supplemental rating decision has ended and the Veteran's November 2023 NOD was a timely appeal to this decision, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board construes the Veteran's November 2023 NOD to appeal the October 2023 supplemental rating decision.  Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182 NOD, the Veteran elected the Direct Review option.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for GERD, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Veteran's appeal has been advanced on the board's docket.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c).

1. Entitlement to service connection for GERD.

The Veteran has continuously pursued her August 2021 claim for service connection of GERD through a series of Supplemental Claims and HLRs, with the most recent being the October 2023 supplemental rating decision.

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to service connection for GERD because she is affected by the burn pits she was exposed to in Iraq from 2003 to 2004.  See May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Claim; November 2023 VA Form 10182 NOD; December 2022 VA Form 20-0996 HLR Request; see also December 2023 TERA Memo; August 2023 TERA Memo; March 2023 TERA Memo.  Additionally, the Veteran contends that she started having heartburn in service, and it has continued since without going away.  See August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ Claim; see also December 2022 VA Form 20-0996 HLR Request.

The Board notes that in the January 2022 initial rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability of GERD based on her VA treatment records that reflect a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with continued treatment on August 5, 2021.  Additionally, in the December 2022 HLR rating decision, the AOJ made additional favorable findings, including (1) the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability of GERD based on her private treatment records assessment of GERD on December 26, 2017; and (2) that the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during her service based on service treatment records that note treatment for stomach cramps between February 23 and February 25, 2001, during active duty for training.  Further, in the October 2023 supplemental rating decision, the AOJ made an additional favorable finding that the VA examination conducted on February 14, 2023, confirms a diagnosis of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as of 2014.  The Board is bound by the favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Under the AMA, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2)?AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  ?See?38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).  Having reviewed the evidence of record, the Board finds that remand for pre-decisional duty to assist errors is required for the issue on appeal for the following reasons.

In a February 2023 VA medical opinion, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's GERD is less likely than not due to treatment for stomach cramps between February 23 and February 25, 2001, and an upset stomach on April 20, 2001, during active duty for training.  As rationale, the VA examiner cited that the Veteran's STRs were related to the Veteran's acute viral gastroenteritis that resolved in service with no residual or sequela, which is different from the etiology that causes acid reflux from stomach to esophagus due to a spicy diet/food, chocolate, and mints.

However, the Board finds the VA examiner's opinion inadequate for failing to fully address the Veteran's statements about how her acid reflux began in service and continued since service and that she has been self-medicating with over-the-counter (OTC) medications.  Additionally, the examiner failed to address whether the Veteran's service treatment records related to esophageal reflux and heartburn in November 2011 and the Veteran's December 2014 private treatment records assessing GERD are related to the Veteran's active service.

The Veteran's December 2000 report of medical history (RMH) and report of medical examination (RME) and her January 2005 RMH and RME do not contain reports or notes of GERD, and the Veteran's systems were clinically evaluated as normal.  However, in a December 2011 VA primary care examination, the Veteran stated she was concerned about never having a separation physical from the Army and would like her past issues documented.

In a March 2023 medical opinion, a different VA examiner opined that the Veteran's GERD is less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  As rationale, the VA examiner stated that GERD is a known diagnosis with known etiologies; there is no unknown diagnosis as it usually has clear and distinct risk factors and causation.  Additionally, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's GERD was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activities, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran, as GERD has known risk factors and causations.

However, the Board finds the March 2023 opinion inadequate as the examiner failed to fully address the Veteran's statements regarding burn pit exposure and self-medicating since service.  Additionally, the VA examiner failed to explain their rationale other than generally stating that GERD has known risk factors and causation but doesn't explain what those risk factors or causations are or whether they are related to the Veteran's TERA participation.  

Accordingly, the AOJ erred by not obtaining complete and adequate VA opinions; remand is warranted to correct these pre-decisional duty to assist errors.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  VA's duty to assist "includes providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion when such an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on the claim."  Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007) (internal quotation omitted).

This matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain addendum opinions regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's GERD.  Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination if one is required by the clinician.  Based on a review of the record, the clinician should opine on the following:

(a)	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's current GERD onset in service, onset within a year of separation from service, or is otherwise related to service?

Please address the Veteran's November 2011 esophageal reflux assessed in the Veteran's STRs, her reported GERD at the December 2014 private treatment records, and her consistent reports and VA treatment records indicating that she self-treated using OTC medications since service.

The examiner should identify and address the GERD risk factors and causations mentioned in the March 2023 TERA medical opinion.

(b)	If not, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's GERD is due to her in-service TERA participation, considering the total potential exposure and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran?

A complete rationale must be provided for all opinions offered.  All opinions provided must be thoroughly explained, and an adequate rationale for any conclusions reached must be provided.  If any requested opinion cannot be provided without resort to speculation, then the medical professional should state and explain why an opinion cannot be provided without resort to speculation.

In rendering each opinion, the clinician is advised that the Veteran is competent to report her symptoms and history.  The clinician should not improperly discount the Veteran's lay statements or mistakenly rely solely on an absence of medical evidence in the service or post-service record to support their conclusions.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, then the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation.
