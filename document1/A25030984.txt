DOCKET NO. 240902-470459
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right knee disability is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

There is no eligible AMA rating decision that adjudicated a claim for service connection for right knee disability issued in the year prior to receipt of the September 2024 VA Form 10182.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of service connection for right knee disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.20, 19.21, 19.22.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2012 to November 2015. The Board thanks the Veteran for her service to our country.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

In the Veteran's September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), she indicated she was appealing the issue of service connection for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with a decision date of March 10, 2016. The Board finds that there was no eligible AMA rating decision issued within one year prior to receipt of the Veteran's September 2024 VA Form 10182 that adjudicated the issue of service connection for right knee disability and, therefore, there is no case or controversy for the Board to decide.

The Board notes that service connection for right knee disability was most recently denied in a March 2016 rating decision in the legacy system, not the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 526EZ seeking service connection for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome. VA correspondence dated in August 2024 informed her that VA received mail indicating that she would like VA to review a claim for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome that VA previously denied. VA regulations require her to file this request on the proper form and provided a chart to assist the Veteran in identifying which form to use. 

While the Veteran listed right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome on the September 2024 VA Form 10182, there was no AMA-eligible adjudication of that claim and, therefore, there is no issue of fact or law for the Board to decide. Thus, the Board has no authority to review the Veteran's appeal for service connection for right knee disability as there is no eligible decision subject to Board review under the AMA with respect to this issue. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (indicating that all claims must be on a form prescribed by the Secretary). If the Veteran wishes to file a claim to have her previously denied claim for right knee disability readjudicated, she may initiate a claim with the AOJ by filing a Supplemental Claim on VA Form 20-0995 with the submission of new and relevant evidence. 

?

In light of the foregoing, the appeal seeking review of the previously denied claim of service connection for right knee disability is dismissed.
