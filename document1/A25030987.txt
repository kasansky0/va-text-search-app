3. Due to the March 2023 concurrent election, which is a procedural defect, the Board will not adjudicate the merits of the claim seeking entitlement to service connection for a right shin splint. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from November 1995 to November 1998.

This case is being reviewed according to the appellate process set forth under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 38 C.F.R. § 19.2. The AMA or modernized review system applies to all claims, requests for reopening of finally adjudicated claims, and requests for revision based on clear and unmistakable error for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019, the effective date of the modernized review system. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following a decision issued in May 2022 by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which denied entitlement to service connection for urticaria (claimed as a skin condition, bilateral shin splints, and low back strain. The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on March 8, 2023 and elected the Direct Review docket. 

The Board notes the Veteran's March 2023 Notice of Disagreement also sought entitlement to service connection for a hernia and acknowledged a February 22, 2023 notification letter. In a February 16, 2023 claim, the Veteran sought entitlement to service connection for a hernia which was previously denied in a February 2019 rating decision. On February 22, 2023, the Veteran was notified his claim seeking review of the previously denied claim of service connection for a hernia was not filed on the proper form as prescribed by the Secretary. See 38 U.S.C. § 501(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. The Veteran was informed his claim must be submitted on the proper form. Accordingly, this claim is not before the Board at this time.

On March 8, 2023, the Veteran concurrently filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2022 decision. The Board notes concurrent elections are impermissible, and that the Veteran never withdrew either appeal option. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

In January 2025, the Veteran was issued a Pre-Dismissal Error Notification Letter informing him of the procedural defect and informing the Veteran that he must complete an additional VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) within 60 days of the January 2025 notification letter in order to proceed with his Board appeal. The notification informed the Veteran that his appeals would be dismissed if a corrected VA Form 10182 was not received. 

As the 60 days have passed and the VA has not received the requested VA Form 10182, the Board finds the Veteran's appeals seeking entitlement to service connection for urticaria (claimed as a skin condition, bilateral shin splints, and low back strain must be dismissed.

The Board is authorized to dismiss any appeal that fails to allege an error of fact or law. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d)(5). Accordingly, these matters are dismissed.
