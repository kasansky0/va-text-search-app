ORDER

FINDING OF FACT

At the time the Veteran filed the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), there was already a supplemental claim review request pending for the claim seeking entitlement to VR&E benefits.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to VR&E benefits are met.?  38 U.S.C. § 7105;?38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2009 to May 2013.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) thanks the Veteran for his service to our country.

This matter was docketed at the Board in response to an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), in an attempt to appeal an administrative decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction on January 31, 2024, which denied entitlement to VR&E benefits.  However, at the time the Veteran filed the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), there was already a supplemental claim review request pending for the claim seeking entitlement to VR&E benefits.  In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

In October 2023, the Veteran requested copies of VA examination reports between August 2023 to October 2023, which were provided to him in April 2024. 

As a final preliminary matter, the Board recognizes VA regulations require the Board to contact a claimant and request clarification if the Board cannot identify which review option a claimant intends to select.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f).  Furthermore, a Notice of Disagreement may be unclear if an appellant attaches evidence to a Notice of Disagreement indicating than an appellant is seeking Direct Review, as under that review option evidence, submitted along with a Notice of Disagreement may not be considered by the Board.  Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023).  In this appeal, the Veteran submitted additional documents with the August 2024 VA Form 10182.  However, September 3, 2024 VA correspondence notified the Veteran and his representative that additional documents and/or statements had been submitted on or with the June 2024 VA Form 10182, but because the Direct Review option had been selected, any additional evidence submitted on or with the VA Form 10182 could not legally be considered by the Board.  The September 3, 2024 VA correspondence also advised the Veteran and his representative that if they wanted the Board to consider any additional evidence for the issue listed on the August 2024, VA Form 10182, they must change the Board appeal request by switching AMA dockets (to Evidence Submission or Hearing), and if this request was approved, they would then have the opportunity to submit any additional evidence they wanted the Board to consider.  However, neither the Veteran nor his representative responded or requested the docket be switched, and the time to change the docket has now elapsed, as it is 60 days of the date the Board received the VA Form 10182 at issue, or within one year of the VA decision being appealed, whichever date is later.  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  Moreover, no further action is required as to this issue, or any other due process deficiency, if such exists, given that this appeal is being dismissed due to an impermissible concurrent election.  

1. Entitlement to VR&E benefits 

Under?38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, claimants may?elect?to?have?a decision reviewed by the AOJ by filing a supplemental claim, VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, or higher-level review request, VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request, Higher Level Review, or, alternatively, they may seek a Board appeal.  The AMA does not permit concurrent elections of appeal options such as in this case.  38?C.F.R. §?3.2500(b).  Recently, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held in?Terry?v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?1, 25-26?(2023), that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative?review?option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative?review?option does not run concurrently with the first administrative?review?option."?  The Court's holding was expressly predicated on the finding that?multiple?administrative?review?requests were "not pending concurrently," as such would be prohibited under?38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A).?  Id.?  Accordingly, the Court's holding in?Terry?makes it clear that only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues.  ?Id.  However, the AMA allows a claimant to change appeal options by submitting a written withdrawal of the initial appeal option and filing the appropriate application for the requested review option so long as the change is within one year from the date on which VA issued notice of the decision at issue.  38?C.F.R. §?3.2500(e). 

In the present case, the Veteran did not submit a withdrawal of his February 2024 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim prior to or at the time of filing his August 2024 VA 10182 Board appeal as to the issue of entitlement to VR&E benefits.  Also, prior to the August 2024 VA 10182 Board appeal as to the issue of entitlement to VR&E benefits, the Veteran also submitted a July 2024 VA 10182 as to this same issue, which was not docketed by the Board.  He also submitted an April 2024 VA 10182 Board appeal, which did express any disagreement as to a specific issue or a specific decision.  However, the Veteran did not submit a withdrawal of his February 2024 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim prior to or at the time of filing his August 2024 VA 10182 Board appeal as to the issue of entitlement to VR&E benefits, including within the context of these earlier VA 10182 Board appeals.  

Additionally, along with his August 2024 VA 10182 Board appeal at issue, the Veteran submitted additional documents, including a duplicative statement, which he had previously submitted in February 2024, and again in July 2024, which was titled "Personal Statement for VR&E Supplemental Claim Appeal" and expressed that it was his hope "the decision to deny my VR&E benefits will be reconsidered."  Thus, although the Board recognizes the AOJ captioned this issue as "Veterans Readiness and Employment Counselor found veteran was not entitled to VR&E services.  Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim but wishes to withdraw the Supplemental Claim and file a Notice of Disagreement instead", the record before the Board does not include a withdrawal of the February 2024 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim prior to or at the time of filing his August 2024 VA 10182 Board appeal as to the issue of entitlement to VR&E benefits.

As the issue of entitlement to VR&E benefits had not been withdrawn, it was still pending a final decision in the supplemental claim review process.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the August 2024 VA Form 10182 was improper as to the request for the Board to review the issue of entitlement to VR&E benefits as there was already a pending review of the same issue at the time the VA Form 10182 was filed.  Filing of such concurrent review options under the AMA is prohibited.  See 38?C.F.R. §?3.2500(b).  As such, the Board must dismiss the Veteran's appeal insofar as it seeks review of the issue of entitlement to VR&E benefits because of the failure to comply with VA's claim processing rules, which prohibits Board review of this issue at this time.

The Board also acknowledges the notice provisions regarding a jurisdictional defect in 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c) but does not find that they are for application here as to the appeal for entitlement to VR&E benefits.  The procedural posture of this case is not at issue.  It is clear that that when the Veteran filed the August 2024 VA Form 10182 there was already a pending review of the same issue at the time the VA Form 10182 was filed.  Accordingly, applying the notice provision would serve no useful purpose or avail the Veteran of any benefit.  

For the foregoing reasons, the appeal of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to VR&E benefits is dismissed.
