2. A complete VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) requesting Board review of the issue of entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-VA medical services provided from June 14, 2019 to June 16, 2019 (claim 302036400042094000), has not been received; the appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

In March 2022, the Board received a VA Form 10182 completed by an employee of "Benefit Recovery," who elected the Direct Review docket to review December 2020 and January 2021 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) decisions. The Board notes that the March 2022 VHA was not timely for the listed decisions. However, the VHA file of record shows that a secondary claim for the episode of care from June 14, 2019 to June 16, 2019 was denied in an April 2021 Explanation of Payment. The March 2022 VA Form 10182 is timely for the April 2021 decision. As the claims are being dismissed because Benefit Recovery is not an appropriate claimant to submit an appeal, the untimeliness of the appeal as to the claim for the June 14, 2019 episode of care is appropriately dismissed for that initial reason instead.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

A December 30, 2020 Explanation of Payment sent to Baptist Memorial Hospital-Golden Triangle, denied a claim for payment or reimbursement for a June 14, 2019 episode of care because the claim was filed after the 90-day time limit for filing under 38 U.S.C. § 17.1004(D). See January 25, 2024 Medical Expense Reimbursement VHA file, 12.

A January 2021 Explanation of payment sent to Baptist Memorial Hospital-Golden Triangle, denied a claim for payment or reimbursement for a June 14, 2019 to June 16, 2019 episode of care because the claim was filed after the 90-day time limit for filing under 38 U.S.C. § 17.1004(D). See id., 13.

Subsequent to an additional claim for benefits, an April 2021 Explanation of Payment sent to Baptist Memorial Hospital-Golden Triangle, denied a claim for payment or reimbursement for a June 14, 2019 to June 16, 2019 episode of care because the claim remained untimely. See id., 14.

An undated Report of Contact (memorandum for the file) noted that the claim for $84.00 for the June 14, 2019 episode of care was received in December 2020 and was denied as untimely. An additional claim for the June 14, 2019 episode of care was received in April 2021. The claim for $16,221.86 for the June 14, 2019 to June 16, 2019 episode of care was initially received in January 2021 and received again in April 2021. The VA Legal Administrative Specialist reviewed electronic records and did not find a timely appeal of either claim. See id., 2. 

The Board finds that "Benefit Recovery" (Benefit Recovery Specialists) is not a proper claimant that may file a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204 (a Notice of Disagreement may be filed by a claimant or by his or her representative if a proper Power of Attorney is on record or accompanies such Notice of Disagreement).

"Claimant" is generally defined under VA regulations as a person who filed a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 20.3(f), (g). Under Part 17 of the regulations, claimants for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical services for unauthorized treatment may include the veteran who received the services; the hospital, clinic, or community resource which provided the services; or a person other than the veteran who paid for the services. 38 C.F.R. § 17.123.

When viewed in context of authorized non-VA medical services, health care providers include entities authorized to furnish medical services to covered veterans that enter into bid contracts to establish networks of health care providers. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 1703(c), (h); 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4005, 17.4030. There is no indication under the applicable law and regulations that a non-veteran entity that did not furnish the underlying medical services may be considered a claimant.

Benefit Recovery describes itself as an "leader in healthcare operations, revenue cycle management, and software development fields." https://brsi.ai/about/ (accessed April 3, 2025).

The record does not reflect that Benefit Recovery is a health care provider as described in the regulations or that Benefit Recovery provided the underlying treatment on June 14, 2019 or from June 14, 2019 to June 16, 2019 (the care was provided by Baptist Memorial Hospital-Golden Triangle), associated with a claim for payment for the non-VA medical services. Moreover, Benefit Recovery is not a "representative" of the Veteran or of the hospital. See 38?C.F.R. §§ 14.627, 14.629 (related to definitions as used in regulations on representation of VA claimants and the requirements for accreditation of service organization representatives, agents, and attorneys).

The Board finds the March 2022 VA Form 10182 filed by Benefit Recovery did not initiate appellate review. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(a), (b)(2)(A) (notices of disagreement shall be in writing, shall identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees, and may be filed by the claimant, the claimant's legal guardian, or such accredited representative, attorney, or authorized agent as may be selected by the claimant or legal guardian.); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202(a), 20.204.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
