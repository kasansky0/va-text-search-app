ORDER

Entitlement to an initial 20 percent disability rating, but no higher, for service-connected conjunctivitis with dry eye syndrome and punctate keratitis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, her service-connected conjunctivitis with dry eye syndrome and punctate keratitis exhibited symptoms comparable to a bilateral disorder of the lacrimal apparatus.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial 20 percent rating, but no higher, for service-connected conjunctivitis with dry eye syndrome and punctate keratitis, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.75-4.78, 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6025.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active-duty service from February 1988 to February 1992.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an initial 20 percent disability rating, but no higher, for service-connected conjunctivitis with dry eye syndrome and punctate keratitis

The Veteran claims entitlement to an initial 20 percent analogous disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6025. See May 2024 Statement in Support of Claim.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Rating Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.

If two disability ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. In view of the number of atypical instances, it is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. It is the defined and consistently applied policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

Under the currently assigned Diagnostic Code 6018, inactive chronic conjunctivitis is to be evaluated based on residuals, such as visual impairment and disfigurement (diagnostic code 7800). Active chronic conjunctivitis warrants a minimum 10 percent rating, and further evaluation under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye may warrant a higher rating. Per the July 2023 VA examination report, the VA examiner did not find that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of conjunctivitis, active or inactive.

The General Rating Formal for Diseases of the Eye instructs to evaluate on the basis of either visual impairment due to a particular condition or on incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation. Note (1) indicates that, for the purposes of evaluations under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes. Per the July 2023 VA examination report, the Veteran has not suffered an incapacitating episode in the past 12 months due to her eye disability. 

The evaluation of visual impairment is based on impairment of visual acuity (excluding developmental errors of refraction), visual field, and muscle function. 38 C.F.R. § 4.75 (a). To determine the evaluation for visual impairment when both decreased visual acuity and visual field defect are present in one or both eyes and are service connected, visual acuity and visual field defects are evaluated separately, and then combined under the provisions of § 4.25.

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of dry eye syndrome, of which is not a disorder specifically listed in the rating schedule and, therefore, should be rated by analogy to a closely related disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4.27. Chronic conjunctivitis (Diagnostic Code 6018) and disorders of the lacrimal apparatus (Diagnostic Code 6025) have symptoms such as watering of the eyes, redness, and eye discharge, which most closely relate to the Veteran's dry eye syndrome symptoms. Of the relevant diagnostic codes, the Board finds that Diagnostic Code 6025 is more appropriate in that the evidence indicates that the Veteran's dry eye syndrome is pathologically related to impairment of the lacrimal apparatus. Id. 

The Board notes that the Court has held that the selection of a particular Diagnostic Code "is a determination that is completely dependent upon the facts of a particular case," and the Board has discretion in determining the appropriate diagnostic Code. Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993) (applying the more deferential "arbitrary, capricious" standard, rather than de novo review, to the Board's determination of the appropriate Diagnostic Code). Accordingly, the Veteran's bilateral dry eye syndrome will be rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6099-6025, by analogy to a disorder of the lacrimal apparatus. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4,27; Lendermann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

Under Diagnostic Code 6025, a 10 percent rating is warranted if the disorder of the lacrimal apparatus is unilateral, and a maximum 20 percent rating is warranted if the disability is bilateral. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6025. The parts of the lacrimal apparatus identified in Diagnostic Code 6025 (epiphora and dacryocystitis) are not an exclusive list, and the lacrimal apparatus is defined as "the system concerned with the secretion and circulation of tears and the normal fluid of the conjunctival sac; it consists of the lacrimal gland and ducts, and associated structures." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 120 (31st Ed. 2007).

Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that an initial 20 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's bilateral dry eye syndrome under Diagnostic Code 6025. Specifically, the VA examiner indicated in the July 2023 VA examination report that the Veteran experiences dry irritation due to bilateral dry eye syndrome. While the VA examiner indicated that the Veteran does not have a disorder of the lacrimal apparatus, a diagnosis of dry eye syndrome and the use of over-the-counter artificial tear drops was indicated. Id.

Diagnostic Code 6025 contemplates an eye disability involving "the secretion and circulation of tears and the normal fluid of the conjunctival sac," and, here, the Veteran's bilateral dry eye disability requires treatment with over-the-counter and prescription eye drops. In light of the Veteran's documented bilateral dry eye syndrome symptoms and treatment, the definition of the "lacrimal apparatus" set forth above, and by resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that, under Diagnostic Code 6025, an initial 20 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for bilateral dry eye syndrome. This is the maximum schedular rating under Diagnostic Code 6025.

As for visual field and diplopia, evaluation of visual field is based on the remaining field of vision in each eye. 38 C.F.R. § 4.77. Evaluation of visual impairment of muscle function is based on the degree of diplopia. 38 C.F.R. § 4.78 (a). Per the July 2023 VA examination report, the Veteran denied, and the VA examiner did not find, signs or symptoms of a decrease in visual acuity, or other visual impairment, nor diplopia; having noted excellent visual acuity with eyeglasses. Therefore, a higher rating is not available on the basis of loss of visual field defects, impairment or muscle function.

Finally, there is no evidence, and the Veteran does not contend that the dry eye syndrome results in any characteristics of disfigurement such that a separate compensable rating would be warranted under Diagnostic Code 7800.

Accordingly, an initial rating of 20 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's service-connected eye disability is granted. The benefit of the doubt has been resolved in the Veteran's favor. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.
