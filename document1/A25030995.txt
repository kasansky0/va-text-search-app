DOCKET NO. 240828-469970
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 31, 2023, for the grant of service connection for myocardial infarction, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 31, 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, for entitlement to service connection for a myocardial infarction; prior to this date there was no formal claim, informal claim, or written intent to file a claim for entitlement to service connection for a myocardial infarction.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 31, 2023, for the award of entitlement to service connection for a myocardial infarction, are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1986 to January 1989, with additional service in the Army National Guard.

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

This matter is on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision.  In August 2024, the Veteran timely appealed the September 2023 decision to the Board by requesting the AMA Direct Review lane.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Thus, in this case, the Board has not considered any evidence added to the claims file after the September 2023 rating decision.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence added to the claims file after September 13, 2023, he should submit a supplemental claim and identify that evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Earlier Effective Date

The Veteran is seeking an effective date earlier than March 31, 2023, for the Veteran's grant of service connection for a myocardial infarction.

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  If the claims are received within one year after separation from service, the effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be the day following separation from active service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).  Unless specifically provided, the effective date will be assigned on the basis of the facts as found.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (a).

A review of the record shows that the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, for entitlement to service connection for a myocardial infarction, with VA on March 31, 2023.  The evidence of record does not contain, and the Veteran does not allege, that there is any communication from the Veteran prior to March 31, 2023, that may be construed as an intent to seek or apply for service connection for a myocardial infarction.

A September 2023 rating decision granted service connection for a myocardial infarction and assigned a 100 percent evaluation affective March 31, 2023.

Given the foregoing, the earliest possible effective date, under the law, for the grant of service connection for myocardial infarction, is March 31, 2023, the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Accordingly, the claim for an effective date earlier than March 31, 2023, for the award of service connection for a myocardial infarction, is denied.
