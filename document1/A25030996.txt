ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability from June 21, 2022, is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing payment of monetary benefits. 

FINDING OF FACT

From June 21, 2022, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities prevented him from securing and following substantial gainful employment. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability from June 21, 2022, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 4.3, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1974 to July 1978. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in March 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability.

The Veteran contends entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities as of June 21, 2022. 

The period on appeal starts on June 19, 2023, the date the VA received the Veteran's claim for a TDIU, an increased rating, plus a one-year look back period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). 

Total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340. Said another way, a total disability rating for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. 

The Board may assign such rating in the first instance, when warranted, only if the Veteran has one service-connected disability rated at 60 percent or more or has multiple service-connected disabilities combining to at least 70 percent with at least one disability rated at 40 percent or more. Id. For purposes of the aforementioned, disabilities resulting from a common etiology are considered as one disability. Id. 

As of June 21, 2022, the Veteran was in receipt of service connection for persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress rated as 70 percent disabling, obstructive sleep apnea rated as 50 percent disabling, rhinosinusitis and pansinusitis rated as 10 percent disabling, tinnitus rated as 10 percent disabling, and migraine headaches and nasal septal both rated as noncompensable or zero percent disabling. 

The Veteran meets the schedular criteria for the Board to assign a TDIU in the first instance as of June 21, 2022. He has specifically requested a TDIU as of June 21, 2022, and has not averred entitlement to an extraschedular TDIU prior to June 21, 2022, nor does the record reasonably raise such issue. Although cognizant that the attorney has generally asserted entitlement to the earliest effective date allowed, the specific argument put forth is for June 21, 2022, and the Board agrees. The Board finds the award herein represents a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal. 

In determining employability for VA purposes, consideration is given to the level of education, special training, and work experience. 38C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16(a), 4.19; Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000). The question is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993); 38C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.15, 4.16(a). Age or impairments caused by nonservice-connected disabilities may not be considered when determining whether such a total disability rating is warranted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3. The benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies when the evidence is in approximate balance or nearly equal. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

The record reflects the Veteran has a high school education and has not worked full time in substantial gainful employment since December 2020. He also reported that his disabilities first affected his employment in December 2019. He said he had a high school education and last worked as a truck driver. He provided an additional statement in support with his claim application detailing how his several disabilities impacted his ability to work which the Board has reviewed and considered. 

The Veteran submitted the medical-vocational opinion of a non-VA nurse in June 2023. The nurse opined that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's service-connected mental health disability, sinus disability, and tinnitus rendered him unable to perform gainful employment. The nurse noted the Veteran's functional limitations impacting his ability to work caused by his service-connected disabilities included cognitive deficits, impaired thought processes and motivation, difficulty interacting with others, inability to work around pulmonary irritants and extreme temperatures, and difficulty with hearing, verbal communication, and fatigue related to tinnitus. The Board has also reviewed and considered the Veteran's medical treatment records and VA examinations for his service-connected disabilities during the period on appeal. 

After consideration of this record and the arguments made on appeal, the Board agrees that the appropriate date is June 21, 2022. The Veteran filed his formal TDIU claim on a VA Form 8940 in June 2023. Within the year prior, that is June 21, 2022, it was factually ascertainable that the TDIU was warranted based on the addition of service connection for the psychiatric disability and the schedular criteria being met.

?

Upon review, the Board finds from June 21, 2022, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities prevented him from securing and following substantial gainful employment. Consequently, a TDIU is warranted from June 21, 2022. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.
