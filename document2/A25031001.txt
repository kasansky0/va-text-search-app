ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran has experienced continuity of symptomatology related to his tinnitus since service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2002 to August 2006.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for tinnitus, which he contends is due to his loud noise exposure in service from gun fire, mortar fire, and explosives. See 1/15/24 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §?3.303.?The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1)?a current disability; (2)?in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).???? 

For veterans who served 90 days or more of active service, certain chronic diseases are presumed to have been incurred in service if the disease manifested to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 11101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.309. Alternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or within the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). However, the use of continuity of symptoms to establish service connection is limited to those diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Tinnitus is a chronic disease, considered as "other organic diseases of the nervous system" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). See?Fountain v. McDonald,?27?Vet. App.?258, 260, 271-72?(2015) (explaining that?other organic diseases of the nervous systems include sensorineural?hearing loss and tinnitus). 

In relevant part,?38 U.S.C. § 1154(a) requires that VA give "due consideration" to "all pertinent medical and lay evidence" in evaluating a claim for disability. Davidson v. Shinseki,?581 F.3d 1313, 1316?(Fed. Cir. 2009). A layperson is competent to report the onset of a disability and, when applicable, continuity of his or her current symptomatology. See Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 470 (1994) (explaining that a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).

The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001). 

Here, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus. See 2/15/24 VA Examination at 5. He contends his tinnitus is due to loud noise exposure in service on a regular basis from gun fire, mortar fire, running diesel engines, rocket attacks, and explosives. See 1/15/24 VA Form 21-526EZ; 1/15/24 Lay Statement. Service treatment records also show routine noise exposure, and the Veteran reporting exposure to loud noise. See 8/7/02 STRs at 19; 2/6/06 STRs at 28. Moreover, in-service noise exposure was conceded in the rating decision on appeal based on service treatment records, and such is a favorable finding that is binding on the Board. See 38?U.S.C. §?5104A; 38?C.F.R. §?3.104(c).

As to whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to service, there is evidence supporting continuous symptoms of such between active service and initial post-service complaints. The Veteran contends that his tinnitus began in service in 2003 and has continued since service and progressed to the present. See 2/15/24 VA Examination at 5; 1/15/24 Lay Statement. He never reported his tinnitus because as a marine, he was told to, "suck it up." See 1/15/24 Lay Statement. He also reports that currently, the ringing makes it difficult to concentrate, hear people, cause him to have headaches. He also reports to have the volume on televisions and in headphones very loud.

Post-service treatment records do not reflect complaints of tinnitus or other hearing related symptoms.

The Veteran is competent to report the onset and symptomatology of his tinnitus, which he states began in service and continued post service through the present. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding lay evidence is sufficient to show continuity of symptoms after service); see also Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 471. Thus, the Board finds the Veteran's statements regarding his tinnitus, its onset, and continuous symptoms post service to the present to be competent and credible as they are consistent with the evidence of record.

Moreover, as tinnitus is a chronic disease under 38?C.F.R. §?3.309(a), an award of service connection is permissible solely based on credible evidence of continuity of symptomatology.  Walker.  

In reaching this conclusion, the Board acknowledges the February 2024 VA opinion, in which the examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was not due to service because it was impossible to determine whether there was a threshold shift in his hearing during service as there was no audiogram at his separation from the military. See 2/15/24 VA Examination at 5. However, the Board finds the opinion inadequate as it relies on the lack of records in service. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The examiner also ignored the Veteran's statements regarding ringing in his ears since service. Id; Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007). Thus, the Board assigns the opinion low probative value and finds it is outweighed by the other evidence of record supporting continuity of symptoms since service.

The Board also acknowledges the February 2024 VA opinion, in which the examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was not due to toxin exposures in service. See 2/15/24 Opinion at 3. However, the opinion does not address the Veteran's noise exposure in service and whether such noise exposure caused the tinnitus. Thus, the Board assigns the opinion low probative value and finds it is outweighed by the other evidence of record supporting continuity of symptoms since service.

Based on the foregoing, service connection for tinnitus is granted. In reaching this conclusion, the Board considered the benefit of the doubt doctrine. See Lynch, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 C.F.R. § 5107(b);?38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
