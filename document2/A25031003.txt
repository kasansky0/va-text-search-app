ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is in at least relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus manifested as chronic within a year of discharge from active duty as shown by a continuity of symptoms since.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to presumptive service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The June 2024 rating decision on appeal was issued under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  In the June 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the June 2024 rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran asserts entitlement to service connection for tinnitus as caused by hazardous noise exposure from his in-service duties in an artillery unit.  June 2024 VA Form 10182.

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  

Service connection is established when there is competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See, e.g., Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Certain chronic diseases, such as organic diseases of the nervous system like tinnitus, which are manifested to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from active duty, shall be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated in service, even though there is no evidence of such diseases during the period of service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101(3), 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309.  This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Alternatively, if a chronic disease listed at 38 U.S.C. § 1101(3) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is noted during service or the presumptive period, but not shown to be chronic, then generally a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required for service connection.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).

The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) found the Veteran has a current tinnitus disability and in-service noise exposure.  June 2024 Rating Decision.  The question remaining for the Board is whether the evidence supports his tinnitus had manifested as chronic within year from his discharge from active duty, or if the evidence otherwise supports it as caused by service.

The Veteran asserts having "ringing in ears" since 1975.  August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  Given the inherently subjective nature of tinnitus, the Veteran is uniquely situated to competently identify and report on the onset and duration of ringing in his ears.  A lay person is competent to provide an opinion on the presence of recurrent ringing in the ears since service, as the symptom is capable of lay observation.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002) (noting that the veteran testified that he experienced ringing in his ears in service and that he experienced such ringing ever since service and finding that the veteran was competent to so testify because ringing in the ears was capable of lay observation).  As such, the Board places probative weight on the Veteran's statements regarding an in-service onset of his tinnitus.

The Veteran was afforded two VA examinations for this tinnitus.  The November 2023 VA examiner found no current tinnitus disability, indicating the Veteran did not report having tinnitus.  November 2023 VA Examination for Hearing Loss and Tinnitus.  The February 2024 VA examiner found a current tinnitus disability, but found it was not incurred or caused by in-service noise exposure because the Veteran reported its onset as 30 years after separation.  February 2024 VA Examination for Hearing Loss and Tinnitus.  However, neither the November 2023 VA examiner nor the February 2024 VA examiner explained how the Veteran's claim of having "ringing in ears" since 1975 is consistent with his report during their evaluations of no report of tinnitus or having an onset 30 years after separation.  See November 2023 VA Examination for Hearing Loss and Tinnitus; February 2024 VA Examination for Hearing Loss and Tinnitus.  The February 2024 VA examiner also suggested the Veteran's tinnitus is from hearing loss that developed after separation, but the examiner did not address the evidence suggesting he has hearing loss preexisting service but no tinnitus.  See March 1972 Auditory Case History; November 2023 VA Examination for Hearing Loss and Tinnitus.  The Board finds the November 2023 and February 2024 VA examiners' opinions about the Veteran's tinnitus and his statements during their evaluations to be less probative for these reasons.

The Board also considered evidence showing several medical treatment visits for hearing loss from 2013 to 2019 in which his medical provider found no tinnitus findings.  November 2013 Army Medical Center evidence; April 2016 Army Medical Center evidence; May 2019 Army Medical Center evidence.  But it is unclear if the Veteran was specifically asked about "ringing" in his ears or if he is even aware of tinnitus as a condition.  This evidence raises doe raise a reasonable doubt as to whether his tinnitus had manifested as chronic during service.

In resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds the Veteran's tinnitus as manifested as chronic within a year of discharge from active duty as shown by a continuity of symptomatology based on his lay statements.
