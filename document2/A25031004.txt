ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right shoulder myofascial syndrome is dismissed. 

REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for shoulder impingement rotator cuff tear and a probable SLAP lesion of the right shoulder labrum is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's February 2025 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) was not timely filed with respect to the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right shoulder myofascial syndrome, and there is no basis to waive this mandatory claim-processing rule violation or otherwise decline to enforce the rule. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right shoulder myofascial syndrome have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.203. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1970 to October 1992.

The Veteran's claim regarding entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for shoulder impingement rotator cuff tear and a probable SLAP lesion of the right shoulder labrum comes before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) on appeal from a December 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

The Veteran also appeals from a November 2019 rating decision regarding entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right shoulder myofascial syndrome. This appeal is not timely, and, as will be discussed in detail below, will be dismissed. 

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for shoulder impingement rotator cuff tear and a probable SLAP lesion of the right shoulder labrum, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Pursuant to?38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2), an appellant may modify a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the Board docket being requested. The time limit for such modification is "within one year from the date that the [AOJ] mails notice of the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date that the Board receives the [NOD], whichever is later." See?38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). "[T]he Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up." Williams?v. McDonough,?37?Vet. App.?305?(2024). As a result of?Williams, supra, the Board would normally be precluded from adjudicating the claims of entitlement to service connection for sciatica and right lower extremity radiculopathy until May 14, 2025, which is the later date between (a) one year after the rating decision to be appealed, and (b) 60 days after receipt of the Notice of Disagreement. However, the Veteran's case has been advanced on the docket due to his age. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.800.  The Board will therefore proceed with adjudication of his appeal in recognition of this fact.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right shoulder myofascial syndrome

Governing law and regulations for AMA appeals provide claimants with one year following the date of the mailing of notification of a decision by the AOJ in which to contest the decision via a completed NOD.?38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1);?38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b). 

In Hall v. McDonough,?34?Vet. App.?329?(2021), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the Board has jurisdiction over claims it has docketed, but may dismiss appeals due to procedural defects, such as noncompliance with claims processing rules. In Dunham v. McDonough, No. 23-3014,?2024 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 418?(March 26, 2024) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.), the Court interpreted Hall to say that the Board may enforce the requirements for a NOD, but that if it dismisses a Veteran's claim the Board should identify the governing law, any formal defects in the appeal, whether waiver or forfeiture is a relevant consideration, and any other relevant factors. See also Bethea v. Derwinski,?2?Vet. App.?252, 254?(1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain). 

In?Ferko?v. McDonough,?37?Vet. App.?262, 269?(2024), the Court clarified that, while the one-year deadline in?38 U.S.C. § 7105(b) to file an NOD is not a jurisdictional bar to the Board's review of a claim, "it is an important and mandatory claim-processing rule." Therefore, the Court held, "The Board thus erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of Mr.?Ferko's appeal because his NOD was not filed within section 7105(b)'s one-year period. This does not mean, however, that the one-year deadline is irrelevant. It is an "important and mandatory" component of section 7105(b)'s claim-processing rule. Henderson,?562 U.S. at 435. Such a claim-processing rule would be subject to waiver or forfeiture, but if the "mandatory claim-processing rule" is properly invoked, it "must be enforced." Hamer v. Neighborhood Hous. Servs.,?583 U.S. 17, 20, 138 S. Ct. 13, 199 L. Ed. 2d 249?(2017). Hence, VA need not accept an NOD filed outside that one-year period unless a claimant establishes an adequate excuse for the NOD's untimeliness." 

In this case, the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right shoulder myofascial syndrome identified by the Veteran in the VA Form 10182, which was received by VA on February 20, 2025, was most recently adjudicated in a rating decision issued in November 2019. 

For the following reasons, the claim for entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right shoulder myofascial syndrome that has been docketed at the Board must be dismissed based on noncompliance with the relevant claims processing regulations, specifically the regulation regarding the timeliness of the NOD.?38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C) ("A question as to timeliness or adequacy of the notice of disagreement shall be decided by the Board"). 

First, there is no rating decision addressing this issue that was issued within a year prior to the February 20, 2025 VA Form 10182. Moreover, for the matter identified by the Veteran in his VA Form 10182, there is no indication from the Board's review of the record that the Veteran was not appropriately notified about the November 2019 rating decision and his right to appeal. Significantly, the Veteran does not make any contention to the contrary. The evidence of record with specific consideration to the Veteran's statements in connection with the instant appeal do not reasonably raise any issue of notification deficiency as to the issuance of the November 2019 rating decision and right to appeal. Cf. Cook v. Principi,?318 F. 3d 1334, 1340-41?(Fed. Cir. 2002). Thus, further consideration of a time extension based upon inadequate notification is not warranted for any of these matters. See Robinson v. Shinseki,?557 F.3d 1355, 1361?(Fed. Cir. 2009) ("where a fully developed record is presented to the Board with no evidentiary support for a particular theory of recovery, there is no reason for the Board to address or consider such a theory"). 

The Veteran has not specifically requested an extension of time to file a VA Form 10182 or otherwise asserted good cause under?38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) for not filing a timely VA Form 10182 and to consider an extension of time exception to the one-year time limit for appealing these claims. Cf.?Ferko,?37 Vet. App. at 272?("the Board must determine whether Mr.?Ferko?has shown good cause for, and otherwise demonstrated entitlement to, an extension of the NOD-filing deadline under § 3.109(b)"). Moreover, although the Board is required to liberally read the VA Form 10182 to include consideration of misidentification of the date of the decision being appealed, there is no evidence or argument that there was a rating decision that adjudicated the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right shoulder myofascial syndrome within a year prior to receipt of the February 20, 2025 VA Form 10182. See?38 C.F.R. § 20.202?(a) ("The Board will construe [arguments identifying the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees] in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal"); VA Claims and Appeals Modernization,?84 Fed. Reg. 138, 152?(Fed. Reg. Jan. 18, 2019) ("§ 20.202 notes that '[t]he Board will construe such arguments in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal.' This language protects the rights of a veteran who, for example, incorrectly identifies the date of the agency of original jurisdiction decision, but does provide enough information that VA is able to identify the issue and decision on appeal"). 

In addition, VA has not taken any action with regard to this claim, such as accepting hearing testimony or an extension request, that would lead the Veteran to believe this claim was not subject to the one-year time limit requirement for filing a VA Form 10182 as stated in the appeal notices, and there is otherwise no basis for waiver or forfeiture.?Ferko,?137 Vet. App. at 269?(noting that "a claim-processing rule would be subject to waiver or forfeiture"). The Board did docket the appeal, and apologizes for doing so, but the Court did not indicate in?Ferko?that docketing of the appeal by itself would constitute forfeiture or warrant waiver of the important and mandatory claim-processing rule requiring an NOD be filed within one year of the issuance or mailing of notice of a rating decision. 

For the above reasons, the Veteran's February 2025 NOD was untimely as to the matter of entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right shoulder myofascial syndrome, and there is no basis to waive this claim-processing rule violation or otherwise address this claim on the merits. Thus, the appeal pertaining to the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right shoulder myofascial syndrome must be dismissed.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for shoulder impingement rotator cuff tear and a probable SLAP lesion of the right shoulder labrum is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his right shoulder disability is more severe than his current 20 percent disability rating reflects. 

In?Correia ?v. McDonald, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that, when possible, examiners must include range of motion (ROM) testing on active and passive motion and in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing conditions. 28?Vet. App.?158, 168?(2016).

In September 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA examination to assess the severity of his right shoulder disability. The examiner observed pain on nonweight-bearing, but did not identify ROM measurements for the Veteran's right shoulder in nonweight-bearing. The examiner also did not explain why such testing could not be performed.

In addition, the Court recently held that the Board must discount beneficial medication effects when rating the severity of a musculoskeletal disability in accordance with Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012).  Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, 2024 U.S. App. Vet. Claims?(March 12, 2025) (mem dec) (Bartley).  Here, the September 2024 VA examination report indicates the Veteran treated his right shoulder symptoms with Tylenol.  However, the examiner did not indicate whether the Veteran's ROM improved with medication use (and, if so, to what extent) or specify whether flare-up frequency lessened with medication (and, if so, to what extent). 

For the above reasons, the September 2024 examination is inadequate for rating purposes. The failure to obtain an adequate medical examination of the Veteran's shoulder impingement rotator cuff tear and a probable SLAP lesion of the right shoulder labrum constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error. Remand is therefore necessary to obtain a new medical examination which corrects this error. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an appropriate examination to determine the current severity of his service-connected shoulder impingement rotator cuff tear and a probable SLAP lesion of the right shoulder labrum. Following the examination and a review of the claims file, the examiner should provide a full description of the disabilities and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's shoulder impingement rotator cuff tear and a probable SLAP lesion of the right shoulder labrum under the rating criteria.

(a.) The examiner should specifically note ranges of motion actively and passively and in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing, if possible.

(b.) The examiner should also indicate whether the Veteran's ROM improved with medication use (and, if so, to what extent).

(c.) The examiner should also indicate whether the Veteran's flare-up frequency lessened with medication (and, if so, to what extent). 

If the examiner cannot provide the requested opinions, including measurements of additional range of motion lost during flare-ups, and/or range of motion measurements for active motion, passive motion, and/or in weight bearing and non-weight bearing circumstances, without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given the medical science and known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training). 

If the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge, the examiner should specify the nature of the deficiency and identify what if any clarifying factor(s) would need to be gathered to provide a non-speculative opinion. If the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the record, the examiner should specify as to what if any additional fact(s) would need to be gathered to provide a non-speculative opinion.
