Entitlement to an evaluation of 20 percent, but no higher, for left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS from February 22, 2024 is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 22, 2024 for the award of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 22, 2024 for the award of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) from May 26, 2021 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At no time from May 26, 2021 to February 21, 2024, did the Veteran's back disability cause him to have forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.

2. From February 22, 2024, the Veteran's back disability did not result in forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

3. From February 22, 2024, the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS was manifested by moderate, but not moderately severe, incomplete paralysis.

4. From February 22, 2024, the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS was manifested by moderate, but not moderately severe, incomplete paralysis.

5. While the evidence supports a formal or informal claim for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS on May 26, 2021, prior to February 22, 2024, the evidence establishes that entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS did not arise until June 5, 2024.

6. While the evidence supports a formal or informal claim for service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS on May 26, 2021, prior to February 22, 2024, the evidence establishes that entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS did not arise until June 5, 2024.

7. From May 26, 2021, the Veteran was precluded from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment as a result of his service-connected disabilities.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service from August 1968 to March 1970.

A rating decision was issued in May 2022, granting service connection for DDD with an evaluation of 10 percent effective May 26, 2021.

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2022 rating decision. In August 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR rating decision on appeal, which continued the 10 percent evaluation for lumbar spine DDD.

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim and listed the issue of an increased rating for lumbar spine DDD, to include entitlement a TDIU. A rating decision was issued in July 2024 which increased the evaluation of lumbar spine DDD with IVDS from 10 percent disabling to 20 percent effective February 22, 2024, granted service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy with an evaluation of 10 percent effective February 22, 2024, granted service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy with an evaluation of 10 percent effective February 22, 2024, and denied entitlement to individual unemployability.

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review option. Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the July 2024 decision. Id.

The Board acknowledges that the time to request a docket switch has not yet elapsed; however, in January 2025, the Veteran waived his right to select a different Board review option. Accordingly, the Board will proceed with the appeal. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claims. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c). 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2).

INCREASED RATINGS

A disability rating is determined by applying VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate DCs. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

If there is a question as to which evaluation to apply to the Veteran's disability, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and coordination of rating with impairment of function. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. Therefore, the Board has considered the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of his disability in reaching its decision. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

Increased Rating Claims for Lumbar Spine

During the pendency of the appeal, the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended effective February 7, 2021. 85 Fed. Reg. 76453 (Nov. 30, 2020). However, DCs 5242-5243 were not amended. Thus, the amended criteria do not apply in this case.

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a provides the following ratings for degenerative arthritis of the spine with or without symptoms such as pain (whether or not it radiates), stiffness, or aching in the area of the spine affected by residuals of injury or disease:

A 10 percent rating contemplates forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 40 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the cervical spine greater than 170 degrees but not greater than 335 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.

A 20 percent rating contemplates forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.

A 40 percent rating contemplates forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

A 50 percent rating contemplates unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

Lastly, a 100 percent rating contemplates unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code. Id. at Note 1.

Under DC 5243, the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes, IVDS with incapacitating episodes having total duration of at least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks during the past 12 months is assigned a 10 percent rating, IVDS with incapacitating episodes having total duration of at least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks during the past 12 months, a 20 percent rating, and IVDS with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks during the past 12 months, warrants a 40 percent rating. Lastly, IVDS with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the past 12 months warrants a 60 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

When an evaluation of a disability is based on limitation of motion, the Board must also consider, in conjunction with the otherwise applicable DC, any additional functional loss the Veteran may have sustained by virtue of other factors as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206 (1995). Such factors include more or less movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, swelling, and deformity or atrophy of disuse. The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 state that disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or inflammation in parts of the system, to perform normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and endurance. A finding of functional loss due to pain must be supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.40; Johnston v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 80, 85 (1997).

In general, VA must analyze the evidence of pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, or incoordination and determine the level of associated functional loss in light of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40, which requires the VA to regard as "seriously disabled" any part of the musculoskeletal system that becomes painful on use. DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. 202. The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 (avoidance of pyramiding) did not forbid consideration of a higher rating based on greater limitation of motion due to pain on use, including during flare-ups. The guidance provided by DeLuca must be followed in adjudicating claims where a rating under the DCs governing limitation of motion should be considered.

Although pain may cause functional loss, pain itself does not constitute functional loss. Rather, pain must affect some aspect of "the normal working movements of the body," such as "excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance," in order to constitute functional loss. Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 38-43 (2011) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40). 

Ankylosis is stiffening or fixation of the joint as the result of a disease process, with fibrous or bony union across the joint. Dinsay v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 79, 81 (1996). Note (5) of the General Rating Formula states that, for VA compensation purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is a condition in which the thoracolumbar spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin of the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching. Fixation of a spinal segment in a neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.

1. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for a back disability from May 26, 2021 to February 21, 2024

The Veteran's back disability is rated as 10 percent disabling under DCs 5242-5243 from May 26, 2021 to February 21, 2024. The Veteran seeks a higher rating. The period on appeal begins on May 26, 2021, the date the Veteran was awarded service connection for this disability.

In the May 2021 claim, the Veteran wrote that he was requesting service connection due to shrapnel in his back during an ordinance explosion in 1970.

In a July 2021 examination for back conditions, the Veteran reported chronic low back pain rated two to three out of 10 without movement and seven to nine out of 10 when severe after a strenuous activity in the day. He stated that he had to switch sides when sleeping. He reported pain with any strenuous activity, walking, climbing stairs, hiking, bending, sitting for too long, and sleeping on one side for too long. He reported flare-ups described as, "[w]hen driving for more than 30 minutes, I have to stop on the side of the road and stretch." The flare-ups occurred intermittently, about once or twice weekly. The duration of flare-ups was described as having to stop whatever he was doing for about 15 minutes or more. During flare-ups, the Veteran experienced localized pain at the mid-lower back and a dull ache that sometimes radiated to the right buttock. After stretching, he did not have any radiation to the buttock. The severity of flare-ups was described as an eight or nine out of 10 with much activity and felt worse at the end of the day. The extent of functional impairment experienced during a flare-up was described as being unable to continue with the activity he was doing and having to stop and rest before continuing. He reported functional loss or impairment described as "[when driving for more than 30 minutes, I have to stop on the side of the road and stretch. Continuing to drive in pain will cause loss of control on the road." The Veteran was unable to complete full ranges of motion and complained of pain. Forward flexion was to 80 degrees and extension, right and left lateral flexion, and right and left lateral rotation were to 25 degrees. He exhibited pain on all ranges of motion and had discomfort with movements. Passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion. There was evidence of pain with weight-bearing and active and passive motion that caused functional loss described as the Veteran expressed pain with a frown on his face with continued range of motion exercises. He stopped at a certain level and was unable to proceed. There was no evidence of crepitus or localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue. He was able to perform repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions with additional loss of function or range of motion. This was described in terms of range of motion as forward flexion to 75 degrees and extension, right and left lateral flexion, and right and left lateral rotation to 20 degrees. Pain and fatigability significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over time. This was described in terms of range of motion as forward flexion to 70 degrees and extension, right and left lateral flexion, and right and left lateral rotation to 15 degrees. Pain and fatigability significantly limited functional ability with flare-ups. This was described in terms of range of motion as forward flexion to 75 degrees and extension, right and left lateral flexion, and right and left lateral rotation to 20 degrees. He did not have localized tenderness, guarding, or muscle spasm of the thoracolumbar spine. Muscle strength testing was 5/5. Reflexes and sensation testing were normal. He did not have muscle atrophy or ankylosis of the spine. He did not have any other neurological abnormalities or findings related to the thoracolumbar spine condition. He did not have IVDS of the thoracolumbar spine. He stated that he was not getting involved in duties that involved too much sitting, walking many miles, running, climbing, or hiking. These activities caused him back strain, and he had to do much stretching for better function.

A July 2021 X-ray of the lumbar spine showed degenerative anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 and L4 on L5, multilevel DDD, and facet arthropathy.

In a December 2023 medical treatment record, the Veteran complained of back pain.

There is no other medical evidence in the claims file relevant to the Veteran's back disability during the period from May 26, 2021 to February 21, 2024.

Spine disabilities may be rated either under DC 5242 or DC 5243, whichever method results in the higher evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71A, DC 5243. Addressing IVDS first, DC 5243 allows for the assignment of disability evaluation based on the presences of symptoms of IVDS. In this case, the medical records from May 26, 2021 to February 21, 2024 show the Veteran does not have IVDS of the thoracolumbar spine, and the record does not reflect that the Veteran had any episodes of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that required bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician in the past 12 months. See July 2021 examination report. The Veteran has not asserted that he has IVDS. Accordingly, a rating based on IVDS with incapacitating episodes will not result in a higher evaluation for the Veteran.

Turning to DC 5242, the Board notes that in this case, the Veteran has not been shown to have forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. That is, even with consideration of pain, functional loss, and repetition times three, limitation of forward flexion has exceeded 60 degrees. At worst, forward flexion was limited to 70 degrees. These range of motion findings are consistent with a 10 percent rating, and do not support a higher rating for his back disability. Additionally, the Veteran did not have muscle spasm or guarding during the period on appeal.

With regard to functional loss, as discussed above, the Board has also considered the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, and the holdings in DeLuca and Mitchell. In light of the above evidence, repetitive motion and pain were considered, but the thoracolumbar spine was not additionally limited to the point of demonstrating ankylosis or flexion greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees. Also, there is no evidence that the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. The Board has considered the functional impairments the Veteran experiences. The Veteran is competent to report the symptoms of pain and limited function that he experiences, and the Board finds no reason to doubt his credibility when considering functional loss. However, the effects reported are contemplated in the 10 percent rating assigned.

Therefore, an evaluation in excess of 10 percent from May 26, 2021 to February 21, 2024 for the Veteran's service-connected back disability is not warranted, as the Veteran's symptoms are consistent with the assigned 10 percent rating.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for a back disability from May 26, 2021 to February 21, 2024 is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding forward flexion limited to greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. The evidence also weighs against finding IVDS with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks during the past 12 months. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The claim is denied.

2. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for a back disability from February 22, 2024

The Veteran's back disability is rated as 20 percent disabling under DCs 5242-5243 from February 22, 2024. The Veteran seeks a higher rating.

The next higher rating of 40 percent requires forward flexion limited to 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

The evidence of record is supportive of a 20 percent rating, but no higher, for the Veteran's back disability from February 22, 2024. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. In making this determination, the Board has considered the competent and credible medical and lay evidence of record.

In a June 2024 examination for back conditions, the Veteran reported pain, swelling, stiffness, and numbness/tingling into the bilateral lower extremities. He did not report flare-ups of the thoracolumbar spine. He reported functional loss or impairment described as, "[m]y back condition causes me to have a lot of problems sitting, standing, walking, putting on my shoes and socks, and bending over to pick up items on the ground or near the ground." Forward flexion was to 55 degrees, extension was to 15 degrees, and right and left lateral flexion and rotation were to 20 degrees. He exhibited pain on all ranges of motion. Passive range of motion testing was not performed because it was medically contraindicated. It was not medically advisable to conduct passive range of motion testing because due to the diagnosed DDD, IVDS, and radiculopathy-lumbar passive range of motion testing could not be completed because it may cause the Veteran severe pain or the risk of further injury. There was evidence of pain with weight-bearing and active motion which caused functional loss described as pain and difficulty standing and walking for extended time periods due to back pain. There was evidence of crepitus and localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue described as constant pain rated seven out of 10 in the back. He was able to perform repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions with no additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions. Procured evidence did not suggest that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over time or with flare-ups. He had localized tenderness that did not result in an abnormal gait or spinal contour. He did not have muscle spasm or guarding. Additional factors contributing to the disability included interference with sitting and standing, swelling, and disturbance of locomotion. The Veteran had difficulty with prolonged sitting due to back pain. He would have difficulty driving a car or working at a desk using a computer in a sitting position. He would also have difficulty with prolonged standing, for example standing in line at a store or shop. When the Veteran experienced swelling, he rested and used elevation and ice, which all generally required him to remain in a sitting or lying position. He also had difficulty with prolonged walking and/or running. He did not have muscle atrophy. Muscle strength was 5/5 and reflexes were normal. Sensation testing was decreased in the bilateral feet/toes but was otherwise normal. He did not have ankylosis of the spine or any other neurologic abnormalities or findings related to the thoracolumbar spine. He had IVDS of the thoracolumbar spine. He did not have any episodes of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that required bedrest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician in the past 12 months.

In this case, the Veteran has not been shown to have forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 30 degrees or less or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. That is, even with consideration of pain, functional loss, repetition times three, and flare-ups, limitation of forward flexion has exceeded 30 degrees. At worst, forward flexion was limited to 55 degrees. These range of motion findings are consistent with a 20 percent rating, and do not support a higher rating for the thoracolumbar spine. Additionally, there is no evidence that the Veteran exhibited ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

With regard to functional loss, as discussed above, the Board has also considered the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, and the holdings in DeLuca and Mitchell. In light of the above evidence, repetitive motion and pain were considered, but the thoracolumbar spine was not additionally limited to the point of demonstrating ankylosis or flexion limited to 30 degrees or less. The Board has considered the functional impairments the Veteran experiences described above. The Veteran is competent to report the symptoms of pain and limited function that he experiences, and the Board finds no reason to doubt his credibility when considering functional loss. Nevertheless, the effects reported are contemplated in the 20 percent rating assigned.

Mitchell, DeLuca, and §§ 4.40 and 4.45 do not require the assignment of a higher schedular disability rating where the functional limitation due to pain does not result in limitation of motion sufficient to meet the requirements of the next higher disability rating. Thompson, 815 F.3d at 785-86 (holding that §§ 4.40 and 4.45 do not supersede the requirements for a higher disability rating specified in § 4.71a).

The Board has considered whether the requirement of ankylosis can be met with evidence of the functional equivalent of ankylosis (i.e., functional immobility of the joint). Chavis, 34 Vet. App. 1. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran reported functional loss or impairment described as having difficulty sitting, standing, walking, putting on shoes and socks, and bending over to pick up items on or near the ground, and pain and difficulty standing and walking for extended time periods. In general, the medical evidence does not reflect, and the Veteran does not assert, that his back symptoms cause fixation of the joint. Although the Veteran had significant limitation of range of motion of the spine, such limitation is fully accounted for with the 20 percent rating assigned. Additionally, while the Veteran reported difficulty moving around and with bending over, all the measurements of record indicate that he is generally able to bend his back to some degree. See VA Examination dated June 2024. Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms do not rise to the level of functional ankylosis under Chavis.

The Veteran has IVDS, but even considering DC 5243, in order to get a rating in excess of 20 percent, the Veteran must have incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks during the past 12 months requiring prescription of bed rest by a physician. Here, the Veteran has had no incapacitating episodes meeting this definition. Thus, a higher rating under DC 5243 is not warranted.

In sum, the Board finds that from February 22, 2024, the criteria for a rating higher than 20 percent have not been met. The Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt rule; however, since the persuasive evidence of record is against the Veteran's claim for a rating higher than 20 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claim is denied.

3. Entitlement to an evaluation of 20 percent, but no higher, for right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS from February 22, 2024

4. Entitlement to an evaluation of 20 percent, but no higher, for left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS from February 22, 2024

The Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS and left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS are currently rated as 10 percent disabling each under DC 8520 from February 22, 2024. The Veteran seeks higher ratings. The period on appeal begins on February 22, 2024, the date the Veteran was awarded service connection for these disabilities.

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520. Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, where the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various DCs are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124. The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type pictured for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.

The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017). When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. 

VA Adjudication Procedures Manual, M21-1 (M21-1) provides benchmarks for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe peripheral nerve conditions. Although the Board is not bound by the M21-1, it is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 and conduct its own analysis before determining whether the M21-1 provisions may be relied upon to support its decision. In so doing, the Board can fulfil part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases for its decision. See Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 263-64 (2018). Here, the Board finds that the M21-1 provisions are both relevant and helpful in defining the terms in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

According to the M21-1, a moderate level of evaluation is "the maximum evaluation reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only involvement." These are cases where the sensory symptoms are continuous, and the symptoms are assigned a higher medical grade reflecting significantly disabling impairment and/or they affect a large area in the nerve distribution. Combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. M21-1, V.iii.12.A.2.c.

Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is the maximum rating for sciatic nerve neuritis not characterized by the organic changes specified in 38 C.F.R. § 4.123. This term would be appropriate for "[m]otor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability is expected. Atrophy may be present. However, for marked muscular atrophy, see the criteria for a severe evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520." Id.

M21-1 further provides for severe incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve: marked muscle atrophy is expected. In general, severe incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve involves motor and/or reflex impairment (for example atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability." Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy cases. Id. 

Severe incomplete paralysis warranting a 60 percent rating requires marked muscular atrophy. The intermediate step between these levels is moderately severe incomplete paralysis at 40 percent disabling. The Board would expect this level of disability to reflect a midpoint between marked muscular atrophy and unimpaired muscle strength and size. That is, some muscular impairment is to be expected for the higher rating.

In this case, the Board finds that the severity of the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS and left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS most closely approximated the level contemplated by a 20 percent rating from February 24, 2022.

In a June 2024 examination for back conditions, the Veteran reported pain, swelling, stiffness, and numbness/tingling into the bilateral lower extremities. The examiner provided that the Veteran did not have muscle atrophy. Muscle strength testing and reflexes were normal. Sensation testing was decreased in the bilateral feet/toes but was otherwise normal. He had moderate constant pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness in the bilateral lower extremities. He also had severe intermittent pain in the bilateral lower extremities.

The Board finds the severity of the Veteran's symptoms reflected in the June 2024 examination approximate a moderate level of impairment consistent with 20 percent ratings. In summary, when considering the evidence currently of record, the Veteran experienced "severe" intermittent pain in the bilateral lower extremities. He also experienced "moderate" constant pain, paresthesias/dysesthesias, and numbness in the bilateral lower extremities. As such, the Board finds for the entirety of the period on appeal, the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS and left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS symptoms more closely approximate the criteria for moderate incomplete paralysis.

However, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not establish that the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS and left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS were manifested by moderately severe incomplete paralysis as articulated by a higher 40 percent rating.

A 20 percent rating is permissible for wholly sensory symptoms; in fact, it is the maximum allowable rating for solely sensory symptoms. Therefore, the Veteran's wholly sensory symptoms are fully contemplated by the 20 percent disability ratings now assigned.

The next higher rating is not appropriate because the evidence does not show non-sensory symptoms, trophic changes, impaired muscle strength, impaired reflexes, or a more than moderate overall functional limitation.

In sum, the Board finds entitlement to evaluations of 20 percent, but no higher, for right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS and left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS from February 22, 2024 are warranted. To this extent, the claims are granted.

Earlier Effective Dates

For claims of entitlement to service connection, the effective date will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is filed within one year of discharge; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

With regard to the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, on a facts found basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before she actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008). However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the Regional Office receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers. McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

5. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 22, 2024 for the award of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS

6. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 22, 2024 for the award of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an earlier effective date for the awards of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS and left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS. The Board finds that the issues of right lower extremity radiculopathy and left lower extremity radiculopathy were inferred as part of the Veteran's increased rating claim for a back disability. As the Veteran's original claim for lumbar spine DDD with IVDS was received on May 26, 2021, the May 26, 2021 claim also serves as the date of claim for the issues of right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS and left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS.

Here, the Veteran separated from service on March 25, 1970. The Board has carefully reviewed the Veteran's records and finds no submission received within one year of that date that can be construed as a claim for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy or left lower extremity radiculopathy. The Veteran has not identified a specific submission as a potential earlier claim within one year of discharge from service. Therefore, the Board finds there is no evidence of a claim within one year of discharge. As there is no evidence of a claim for right lower extremity radiculopathy or left lower extremity radiculopathy within one year of discharge, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, the Veteran wrote, in relevant part, "Effective date for left lower extremity radiculopathy. Effective date for right lower extremity radiculopathy." No additional information or contentions were provided.

Neither the Veteran nor his attorney have made any arguments in pursuit of an earlier effective date.

A complete claim must "identify the benefit sought." 38 C.F.R. § 3.160. The Veteran's claims file shows that his claim, received on May 26, 2021, was the first piece of documentation submitted by the Veteran that can be construed as a claim of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy or left lower extremity radiculopathy. The Board acknowledges that the AOJ mischaracterized the February 22, 2024 Supplemental Claim as an intent to file and that the current effective date for the right lower extremity radiculopathy and left lower extremity radiculopathy is incorrectly based on the February 22, 2024 Supplemental Claim rather than the original May 26, 2021 claim. However, as discussed below, this error is harmless as it affords the Veteran earlier effective dates for these disabilities than are warranted in this case.

The Veteran's effective date cannot be earlier than the date of service connection for the primary disability. Thus, in this case, the effective date for the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS and left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS cannot be earlier than the May 26, 2021 claim. The Board acknowledges that the earliest possible date of claim is May 26, 2021; however, the Board finds that the date entitlement arose is later than the date of claim. In this case, entitlement did not arise until the date of the June 5, 2024 VA examination.

In this case, the evidence of record shows that there is no evidence of a diagnosis of right lower extremity radiculopathy or left lower extremity radiculopathy until the date of the June 2024 VA examination.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for back conditions in July 2021. The examiner found that the Veteran did not have radicular pain or any other signs or symptoms due to radiculopathy. No diagnosis of radiculopathy was provided. The Veteran was afforded another VA examination for back conditions in June 2024, during which the examiner found that the Veteran had radicular pain or any other signs or symptoms due to radiculopathy. A diagnosis of bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was provided with the date of diagnosis being 2024.

As provided above, the effective date will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is filed within one year of discharge; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

In this case, although the AOJ incorrectly assigned February 24, 2022, the date of the Supplemental Claim, as the effective date for the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS and left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS, the AOJ has granted the Veteran the earliest possible effective date for service connection for these disabilities as the date entitlement arose, June 5, 2024, is the later of the two dates. However, the Board will not disturb the Veteran's current effective dates despite entitlement not arising until the date of the June 2024 VA examination.

Even though the date of the May 26, 2021 claim is prior to February 22, 2024, the current effective date for these disabilities, the date entitlement arose, June 5, 2024, is still the later of the two dates. Thus, earlier effective dates back to the date of the original May 26, 2021 claim is not warranted.

The Board finds that the criteria have not been met for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grants of service connection for the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS and left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The claims are denied.

7. Entitlement to a TDIU from May 26, 2021

The Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU has been raised under Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009) as part of the Veteran's underlying increased rating claim before the Board. See VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application dated February 2024; VA Form 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability dated February 2024; and Third Party Correspondence dated January 2025. Therefore, the appeal period for the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is the same as the date of the underlying increased rating claim for a back disability: May 26, 2021.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities ("Rating Schedule"), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155. Total disability is considered to exist when there is any impairment which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(1). Total disability may or may not be permanent. Id. Total ratings are authorized for any impairment or combination of impairments for which the Rating Schedule prescribes a 100 percent evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(2).

A TDIU may be assigned when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of their service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). If there is only one such disability, it must be rated as at least 60-percent disabling, and if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated as at least 40-percent disabling and there must be sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to at least 70 percent. Id.

The Veteran's service-connected disabilities include posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder with anxious distress, which is rated as 70 percent from December 20, 2019; lumbar spine DDD with IVDS, which is rated at 10 percent from May 26, 2021 and at 20 percent from February 22, 2024; tinnitus, which is rated at 10 percent disabling from May 26, 2021; right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS, which is now rated as 20 percent from February 22, 2024; left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with lumbar spine DDD with IVDS, which is now rated as 20 percent from February 22, 2024; hypothyroidism, which is rated at 0 percent from January 1, 2021; and bilateral hearing loss, which is rated as 0 percent from May 26, 2021. His combined disability rating is 80 percent from May 26, 2021. Thus, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) for the entire appeal period, as he had one disability rated as at least 40 percent disabling and a combined disability rating of at least 70 percent.

Entitlement to a total rating must be based solely on the impact of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities on his ability to keep and maintain substantially gainful employment. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. Furthermore, VA regulations provide that all Veterans who, in light of their individual circumstance, but without regard to age, are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disability shall be rated totally disabled, without regard to whether an average person would be rendered unemployable under the circumstances. See VAOPGPREC 75-91; 57 Fed. Reg. 2317 (1992).

Consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). However, individual unemployability must be determined without regard to any nonservice-connected disabilities or the Veteran's advancing age. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341(a), 4.16, 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993). A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment, but the ultimate question is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he can find employment. Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. at 363.

Thus, the Board must evaluate whether there are circumstances in the Veteran's case, apart from any non-service-connected conditions and advancing age, which would justify a TDIU rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341(a), 4.16(a), 4.19. See Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. 361; see also Hodges v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 375 (1993); Blackburn v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 395 (1993).

Following a thorough review of the evidence, the Board finds the competent and credible evidence of record supports an award of a TDIU from May 26, 2021.

In a July 2021 examination for hearing loss and tinnitus, the examiner indicated that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss did not impact his ability to work. The examiner also indicated that the Veteran's tinnitus impacted ordinary conditions of daily life, including the ability to work described as the Veteran reported, "[t]he buzzing is always with me. I use Alexa to play sounds to try to distract myself, even though I can hear the ocean from my house, I still can't get rid of it. It's just always there, I can't get rid of it. I can't focus sometimes." At the time of the examination, the Veteran was not employed.

In a July 2021 examination for back conditions, when asked if the Veteran's back conditions impacted his ability to perform any type of occupational task, the examiner wrote, "Yes." At the time of the examination, the Veteran was retired. He was working at home, helping his children and grandchildren with their routine activities. He stated that he retired a long time ago due to his PTSD, but currently, he was not getting involved in duties that would involve too much sitting, walking many miles, running, climbing, or hiking. These activities caused back strain and he had to stretch for better function.

In an October 2021 examination for thyroid and parathyroid conditions, the examiner indicated that the Veteran's thyroid and parathyroid conditions did not impact his ability to work.

The Veteran reported that he was retired in September 2022.

In a January 2024 private opinion, the Veteran's physician discussed the relevant medical evidence of record. She also discussed the Veteran's work history and how his service-connected disabilities affected his past employment. She then discussed how the Veteran's service-connected impairments would affect any current employment. She concluded by writing,

Due to these issues, [the Veteran] would be required to miss work or leave early three or more days per month due to the pain and limitations from his lumbar spine degenerative disc disease, posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder with anxious distress, and hypothyroidism. He would need more than one additional break per day aside from normally scheduled morning, lunch, and afternoon breaks so he could lie down, recline, stretch, etc. And for more than three days per month, he would not be able to stay focused for at least seven hours of an eight-hour workday due to mental health symptoms, constant pain, and extra needed breaks that would take him away from his work at a moment's notice. All of these issues are inconsistent with an ability to sustain even sedentary employment, which at the very least requires a person to be able to attend work reliably, sustain a steady pace and concentration, and work productively. [The Veteran's] service-connected conditions prevent him from meeting any of these demands, and this would not be tolerated by an employer.

In conclusion, after considering the effects of his service-connected degenerative disc disease, posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder with anxious distress, and hypothyroidism, as well as his past relevant work and educational background, it is my medical opinion that [the Veteran] has been unable to maintain substantially gainful employment as a result of his service-connected disabilities since at least May 26, 2021, the date of claim.

In a February 2024 Supplemental Claim, the Veteran's attorney wrote that the Veteran met the threshold percentage requirement to establish eligibility for a schedular TDIU since December 20, 2019.

In VA Form 21-8940 received in February 2024, Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, the Veteran wrote that his lumbar spine DDD prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation. He wrote the date his disability affected full-time employment was April 11, 2011, the same date he last worked full-time and the same date he became too disabled to work. His last occupation was as a director of maintenance operations and transportation. His highest level of education was one year of college. He provided that he left his last job because of a disability. He wrote that his request for a TDIU was part of his increased rating claim under Rice.

In a June 2024 examination for back conditions, the examiner wrote that the Veteran would have difficulty working at a desk using a computer in a sitting position. He also wrote that when the Veteran experienced swelling, he had to rest and use elevation and ice, which all generally required him to remain in a sitting or lying position. The examiner wrote that the Veteran's back condition would affect him in jobs that would require standing, sitting, walking for extended time periods, and/or bending at the waist to pick up items from ground level. The pain could potentially become so severe that it may cause him to miss shifts.

In January 2025, the Veteran's attorney wrote that the Veteran met the schedular requirements for a TDIU. He wrote that the Veteran had not been engaged in substantial gainful employment since April 11, 2011.

Regulations place responsibility for the ultimate TDIU determination on the Board and not a medical examiner. Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The Board finds the opinion of the private examiner and the competent and credible lay statements of record are both persuasive and probative evidence that the Veteran was unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities. The Veteran has completed one year of college and his experience for nearly his entire career was as a director of maintenance operations and transportation. In this case, the private examiner determined that the Veteran would be required to miss work or leave early three or more days per month, required more breaks than provided, and would not be able to stay focused for the duration of the workday more than three days per month due to his service-connected disabilities. She also provided that the Veteran had difficulty concentrating and staying focused due to his psychiatric disability. In this case, the fact that the combination of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities causes him to experience these symptoms keep him from being able to attend work reliably, sustain a steady pace and concentration, and work productively in any job, which, as the examiner stated, would not be tolerated by an employer. Thus, the Board finds persuasive and probative evidence that the Veteran was unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities. Based on the totality of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, the Board finds the evidence establishes that they rendered him unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment from May 26, 2021. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's attorney asserted that the Veteran met the threshold percentage requirement to establish eligibility for a schedular TDIU since December 20, 2019. The Board also acknowledges that the Veteran has asserted that the date his disability affected full-time employment was April 11, 2011, the same date he last worked full-time and the same date he became too disabled to work and that the Veteran's attorney has asserted that the Veteran has not been engaged in substantial gainful employment since April 11, 2011. However, as provided above, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU has been raised under Rice as part of the Veteran's underlying increased rating claim before the Board. Thus, the appeal period for the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is the same as the date of the underlying increased rating claim for a back disability: May 26, 2021. A TDIU is granted from that date.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
