ORDER

Entitlement to a 100 percent disability rating for Parkinson's disease (PD) with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Insomnia, effective March 25, 2021, is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of March 25, 2021, but no earlier, for the 40 percent disability rating for tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of March 25, 2021, but no earlier, for the 30 percent disability rating for balance impairment associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of March 25, 2021, but no earlier, for the 30 percent disability rating for tremor and bradykinesia left upper extremity associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of March 25, 2021, but no earlier, for the 10 percent disability rating for stoop posture associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of March 25, 2021, but no earlier, for the 10 percent disability rating for speech changes associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of March 25, 2021, but no earlier, for the noncompensable disability rating for constipation associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, is granted.

Entitlement to a total rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities, is dismissed as moot.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's PD with MDD and Insomnia has manifested in symptoms such as depressed mood, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events, impairment of short- and long-term memory, for example retention of only highly learned material, while forgetting to complete tasks, disturbances of motivation and mood, and cognitive impairment and/or dementia, all approximating total social and occupational impairment.

2. On March 25, 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, for PD, due to in-service herbicide agent (Agent Orange) exposure.

3. The Veteran has continuously pursued the initial March 25, 2021, claim, for PD.

4. The claims before the Board related to MDD and Insomnia due to PD, PD with Tremor and bradykinesia right upper and left upper extremity, speech changes, stoop posture, and constipation, were each reasonably raised by the Veteran's PD claim received by VA March 25, 2021.

5. As a 100 percent schedular disability rating is assigned for service-connected PD with MDD and Insomnia for the entire rating period, the evidence does not support entitlement to TDIU due to other service-connected disabilities, and the Veteran attributed his inability to work to his PD and associated conditions/symptomology, there remain no questions of law or fact to be decided regarding TDIU.

6. The Veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total and additional service-connected disabilities ratable at 60 percent or more.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service in the United States Air Force from September 1971 to September 1991.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from February and August 2024, rating decisions by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs, that as relevant here, in August 2024, granted service connection for PD with MDD and Insomnia with a 70 percent disability rating evaluation, effective August 10, 2022; and, in February 2024, granted service connection for PD with Tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity (40 percent), effective August 10, 2022; granted service connection for balance impairment (30 percent), effective August 10, 2022; granted service connection for Tremor and bradykinesia left upper extremity (30 percent), effective August 10, 2022; granted service connection for speech changes (10 percent), effective August 10, 2022; granted service connection for stoop posture (10 percent), effective August 10, 2022; and granted service connection for constipation (noncompensable rating), effective August 10, 2022. 

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in February and August 2024, and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February and August 2024, RO decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his attorney with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the RO issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board may not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier effective dates claims

The effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be the day following separation from service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation, otherwise the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).

As to claims filed before March 24, 2015, the term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

Before March 24, 2015, the term "claim" or "application" meant a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). Any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, from a clamant or her representative, may be considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought.

In this regard, it is well settled that intent to apply for benefits is an essential element of any claim, whether formal or informal, and, further, the intent must be communicated in writing. See MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the plain language of the regulations requires a claimant to have an intent to file a claim for VA benefits); Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (noting that even an informal claim for benefits must be in writing).

Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the clamant, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

As to claims filed after March 24, 2015, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). The term "claim" means a formal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

As to claims filed after March 24, 2015, the Veterans' Administration (VA) administrative claims process only recognizes formal claims. A formal claim was one that had been filed on the form prescribed by VA. Id.

However, for an increase in disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). Meaning if the increase occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." For earlier effective date increased rating claims, if the increase occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2) (2017); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (Sept. 23, 1998).

The Veteran has maintained that he is entitled to earlier effective dates of March 25, 2021, for the disability ratings awarded for the following conditions: PD with MDD and Insomnia; Tremor and Bradykinesia right upper extremity; Tremor and Bradykinesia left upper extremity associated with Tremor and Bradykinesia right upper extremity; Balance Impairment associated with Tremor and Bradykinesia right upper extremity; Stoop Posture associated with Tremor and Bradykinesia right upper extremity; Speech Changes associated with Tremor and Bradykinesia right upper extremity; and Constipation associated with Tremor and Bradykinesia right upper extremity. See February 20, 2025, Notice of Disagreement submission.

In the August 2024 rating decision, the RO indicated service connection for PD with MDD and Insomnia was granted effective August 10, 2022, the date the law changed to allow presumptive service connection for PD associated with herbicide exposure at Johnston Atoll Air Force Base.

Turning to the Veteran's claim for earlier effective dates for the disability ratings awarded for the following conditions: PD with MDD and insomnia; PD with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity; tremor and bradykinesia left upper extremity associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity; balance impairment associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity; stoop posture associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity; speech changes associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity; and constipation associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, the Board notes that the Veteran initially filed a claim for PD on March 25, 2021, and has continuously pursued the claim from that point.

Prior to this date, there is no formal or informal claim filed for these conditions nor is there any communication that was not addressed that could have been construed by the RO as a claim for these disabilities. While it is true that entitlement for these conditions may have arisen prior to his current effective date, the earliest available effective date is the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.

Generally, to prevail on a claim of service connection on the merits, there must be competent evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) medical evidence or other competent evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247 (1999); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Service connection can also be established through continuity of symptomatology. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (2013); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309. For chronic diseases shown as such in service or within the applicable presumptive period, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date are service connected unless attributable to an intercurrent cause. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). For a chronic disease to be considered to have been "shown in service," there must be a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings. When the condition noted in service or within the presumptive period is not a chronic disease, a showing of continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required. Id.

For those veterans who have been exposed to herbicide agents, certain diseases are acknowledged to be presumptively related to such exposure. 38 U.S.C. 

§ 1116(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). The diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e) shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after service, with exceptions not applicable in the instant case. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(ii). The enumerated diseases associated with herbicide exposure includes PD. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

The Veteran has argued that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for service-connected PD with MDD and insomnia associated with herbicide exposure. See February 20, 2025, Notice of Disagreement submission. As noted in the August 2024, rating decision on appeal, the RO granted the Veteran entitlement to service connection for PD (with a 70 percent rating), pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, effective August 10, 2022. See PACT Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168 § 3373, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022) at § 403. The Veteran has maintained that the effective date should be the date of his original claim for PD, March 25, 2021, because he would have been entitled to direct service connection at that time. See February 20, 2025, Notice of Disagreement submission.

Based on the above, the Board's analysis will focus on the laws governing such claims and appeals for direct service connection, as doing so may result in a full allowance of the benefits originally sought in March 2021.

The Veteran has maintained that his PD is due to or otherwise related to conceded exposure to herbicide agent in service. See February 20, 2025, Notice of Disagreement submission.

Favorable findings noted in the initial June 2022 rating decision which initially denied direct service connection for PD, include that PD is recognized by VA as being associated with herbicide exposure under 38 CFR 3.309(e), and current treatment records (received 4/12/21) show a diagnosis of PD dated November 3, 2020. Favorable findings noted in an October 2023 higher level review (HLR) rating decision include that, the claimed PD has become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more following service, and that herbicide exposure during military service was conceded. The Board is bound by favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Based on all the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance with regard to whether the Veteran's PD, is due to or otherwise related to the Veteran's service to include conceded in-service herbicide exposure. Accordingly, the claim for entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's PD associated with herbicide exposure, is granted on a direct basis from the date of the Veteran's March 25, 2021, claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), 38 C.F.R. § 4.3, and Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). The Board also finds an earlier effective date is warranted for each award associated with the underlying service-connected PD. Namely, PD with MDD and Insomnia, PD with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, tremor and bradykinesia left upper extremity, balance impairment, stoop posture, speech changes, and constipation.

Increased rating and earlier effective date for PD with MDD and Insomnia

After review, the Board concludes that the Veteran's disability rating for his PD with MDD and Insomnia should be increased to 100 percent.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The ratings are intended to compensate impairment in earning capacity due to a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of a veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's PD with MDD and Insomnia is currently assigned a 70 percent evaluation under DCs 8004-9434. The Veteran has challenged the initial evaluation and effective date of this award (and others, as discussed above). See February 2025 Notice of Disagreement.

DC 9434 pertains specifically to the primary diagnosed disability used for rating in the Veteran's case, MDD. In any event, with the exception of eating disorders, all mental disorders including MDD are rated under the same criteria in the rating schedule. Therefore, rating under another diagnostic code would not produce a different result. Moreover, the Veteran has not requested that another diagnostic code be used. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran is appropriately rated under DC 9434 for PD with MDD and Insomnia.

The criteria for a 70 percent rating are as follows:

Occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

The criteria for a 100 percent rating are as follows:

Total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9434.

The "such symptoms as" language of the diagnostic codes for mental disorders in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 means "for example" and does not represent an exhaustive list of symptoms that must be found before granting the rating of that category. See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002).  However, as the Court also pointed out in that case, "[w]ithout those examples, differentiating a 30% evaluation from a 50% evaluation would be extremely ambiguous."  Id. The Court went on to state that the list of examples "provides guidance as to the severity of symptoms contemplated for each rating." Id. Accordingly, while each of the examples need not be proven in any one case, the particular symptoms must be analyzed in light of those given examples. Put another way, the severity represented by those examples may not be ignored.

The Veteran has maintained that his service-connected PD with MDD and Insomnia warranted an initial rating higher than 70 percent (as well as an effective date based on his original claim for service connection for PD, which was filed March 25, 2021, as discussed above). The Veteran's attorney has also argued that, mainly as result of his PD with MDD and Insomnia and other service-connected conditions associated with his PD, the Veteran is entitled to TDIU. See February 20, 2025, Notice of Disagreement submission.

VA has a "well-established" duty to maximize a veteran's benefits. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011). This duty to maximize benefits requires VA to assess all of a veteran's disabilities to determine whether any combination of disabilities establishes entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008). The Veteran has argued that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for PD with MDD and insomnia of March 25, 2021, and a schedular TDIU, effective March 25, 2021. For the reasons articulated below, the evidence of record indicates that it is more advantageous to the Veteran to rate his PD with MDD and Insomnia, because a 100 percent PD with MDD and Insomnia rating (under DC 9434) accounts for the symptomology as discussed below and any MDD and chronic sleep disturbance considerations, and this entitles the Veteran to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran participated in VA examination/s for mental health conditions in April 2024.

At that time, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's records showed an April 10, 2019, endorsement for chronic depression with suicidality. It was reported that the Veteran's "depression [was] aggravated by Parkinson's disease due to mobility, difficulties, tremors and symptoms getting worse." The associated April 2024 VA Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) concluded that the Veteran had MDD and Insomnia due to PD with occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. The examiner noted the following symptoms: depressed mood, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events, impairment of short- and long-term memory, for example retention of only highly learned material, while forgetting to complete tasks, and disturbances of motivation and mood. An April 2024, VA examination concerning sleep disturbance associated with PD, noted that the PD manifested in mobility difficulties, tremors and worsening symptomology.

At a December 2023 VA examination related to the Veteran's PD, the examiner indicated that the Veteran's PD impacts his ability to work, explaining that, "due to cognitive impairment, [he] would have difficulty in positions of responsibility, [and] completing work tasks ... [and] due to tremors, has difficulty with grip strength and fine motor skills." The examiner also reported that the Veteran's PD manifested with associated moderate cognitive impairment or dementia.

In addition to the VA examinations discussed above, the Board has reviewed treatment records, lay statements and other documents associated with this appeal.  Of particular note, the evidence demonstrates that throughout the appeal period the Veteran has manifested chronic suicidal ideation. As noted in the April 2024 VA examination, the Veteran endorsed suicidal ideation dating back to April 2019.

 The Board notes that the symptoms described by the Veteran and in VA examination report/s, indicates that the severity of his PD with MDD and Insomnia, symptoms warrant a rating higher than 70 percent under DC 9434. Specifically, the Board finds that the Veteran's MDD condition includes an additional Insomnia diagnosis due to PD associated with herbicide exposure, which symptomology the examiner opined could not be distinguishable from his MDD symptomology. Finally, the Board acknowledges the VA examiner's notation that the Veteran's current PD has manifested with "impaired cognition and or dementia" taken together with his history of suicidal ideation, to be significant factors in resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran with respect to an increased rating for his service-connected MDD with Insomnia due to PD.

Accordingly, the evidence suggests that the Veteran's symptomatology throughout the appeal period has most nearly approximated total occupational and social impairment associated with a 100 percent disability rating for the entire period on appeal. The Board notes the Veteran's reports and treatment records indicating that the Veteran suffers from PD with MDD and associated Insomnia. As noted, the Board is particularly concerned with the significant symptomology of suicidal ideation and notes the presence of same dating prior to and throughout the period on appeal, culminating in the initial determination regarding service connection of PD with MDD and Insomnia. See August 2024 rating decision.

Based on all the foregoing, the Board finds that reasonable doubt favors the Veteran. As such, a 100 percent rating for PDD with MDD and Insomnia, is warranted and the claim is granted.

TDIU

The Veteran asserts that he is precluded from obtaining or maintaining substantially gainful employment, specifically as a result of his service-connected PD with MDD and Insomnia.

Based on the Board's decision herein, the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent rating for PD with MDD and Insomnia (under DC 9434) for the entire rating period on appeal.

TDIU is an element of all increased rating requests. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Here, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively supports that the Veteran is unable to secure and maintain gainful employment due solely to his service-connected PD with MDD and Insomnia. TDIU, if granted, would be based on the Veteran's service-connected PD with MDD and Insomnia, for which he is receiving a 100 percent schedular disability rating based on the Board's decision herein. Because his PD with MDD and Insomnia is rated as 100 percent disabling for the entire rating period, the claim for TDIU benefits is moot because an award of a total schedular rating is the greater benefit. As discussed below, entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is granted.

SMC

As referenced above, in order to maximize benefits, the Board finds that it is more beneficial to the Veteran to increase the disability rating for PD with MDD and Insomnia to 100 percent disabling as this condition resulted in total occupational and social impairment for the Veteran. This is because the Veteran now also has a 40 percent disability rating for tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, a 30 percent disability rating for balance impairment associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, a 30 percent disability rating for tremor and bradykinesia left upper extremity associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, a 10 percent disability rating for stoop posture associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, a 10 percent disability rating for speech changes associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, as well as a noncompensable disability rating for constipation associated with tremor and bradykinesia right upper extremity, which based on the foregoing decision, all are effective from March 25, 2021.

Accordingly, given the Veteran is now in receipt of a 100 percent disability rating for PD with MDD and Insomnia for the entire period on appeal, and his other service-connected disabilities are independently ratable at 60 percent or more during the same period, the criteria for SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) are met.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
