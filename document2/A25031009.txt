REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a penile disability, to include erectile dysfunction, is remanded.

INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1999 to September 2002.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 24, 2024, rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In March 2024, VA received the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement electing the Board's Direct Review docket. This restricts the Board's review to the evidence of record at the time of the January 24, 2024, rating decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 20.301. 

Applicable Evidentiary Window

Given the Veteran's election of the Direct Review docket, in this decision the Board has only considered the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of the decision on review. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 20.301. 

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time for which the Board cannot review the evidence, the Board has not considered that evidence in this decision, but the evidence will be considered by the AOJ when it readjudicates the matter following this decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(c). 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Remand is required to ensure that the Veteran is provided a fully adequate VA etiology opinion.

The Veteran submitted a claim for a penile disability secondary to his service-connected PTSD. A VA examination was provided in January 2024, where the Veteran was diagnosed with erectile dysfunction that the examiner remarked was present before the Veteran's PTSD. See January 13, 2024, Examination Report. But the examiner never addressed head-on whether the condition is proximately due to the Veteran's PTSD (the AOJ requested an opinion but the examiner, in answering a number of other opinions, forgot to answer this one, see January 13, 2024, VA Opinion); and even if the examiner's remark in her examination report were sufficient, she didn't at all address whether the condition may be aggravated by PTSD. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140-41 (2013); see also Healey v. McDonough, 33 Vet. App. 312, 322 (2021) ("When VA instructs an examiner to provide an opinion as to secondary service connection, that examiner must separately address the causation and aggravation prongs of secondary service connection"). A new opinion is needed to the cure the deficiencies.  

An opinion is also needed regarding a potential relation to the Veteran's service in Kuwait. His DD-214 shows a deployment in Southwest Asia from November 2001 to March 2002, and one of the Veteran's statements refers to his deployment in Kuwait. See January 6, 2021, Lay Statement (describing stressors). This establishes that the Veteran is a Persian Gulf veteran, and therefore an opinion was needed addressing whether the diagnosed erectile dysfunction may be symptom of a medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (MUCMI). 38 C.F.R. § 3.317. Moreover, the Veteran's status as a Persian Gulf veteran means that he is a toxic-exposed veteran, as the AOJ favorably found in the decision on review. The AOJ therefore also needed to have obtained an opinion addressing whether erectile dysfunction may be related to the Veteran's toxic exposures. 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a).

To cure the failure to provide the Veteran with a fully adequate opinion, remand is justified now. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

The Board by this remand makes no determination, expressed or implied, concerning the credibility of any statements on file. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an opinion addressing the etiology of the Veteran's erectile dysfunction. It is left to the clinician's discretion whether a new examination is needed. 

The clinician must address all of the following:

(a) But for the Veteran's PTSD, would the Veteran have developed erectile dysfunction?

(b) But for the Veteran's PTSD, would the Veteran's erectile dysfunction be less severe and result in less functional impairment? Consider and discuss the Veteran's statement that "My PTSD interferes with sex life. I'm mentally and emotionally start to think about my past."

(c)(i) Is the pathophysiology of the Veteran's erectile dysfunction (1) inconclusive, (2) partially understood, or (3) fully understood? The clinician's opinion must be about the pathophysiology of the Veteran's specific case, not the pathophysiology of the condition in the population as a whole.

(c)(ii) Is the etiology of the Veteran's erectile dysfunction (1) inconclusive, (2) partially understood, or (3) fully understood? The clinician's opinion must be about the etiology of the Veteran's specific case, not the etiology of the condition in the population as a whole. 

(d) Is the Veteran's erectile dysfunction due to the combined synergistic effect of the Veteran's total potential toxic exposure during service in Southwest Asia including Kuwait?
