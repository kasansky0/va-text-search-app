CONCLUSION OF LAW

The March 4, 2024, Board Appeal request is not timely with respect to the administrative decision issued on August 10, 2020, that denied reimbursement for medical services rendered in February 2020 and June 2020, and the criteria for an extension of time to file a Board Appeal request have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 3.2500(b), 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1981 to June 1992. The Appellant in this matter is New Horizons Altru Home Care LLC. 

The Appellant filed a March 4, 2024, Board Appeal request seeking to appeal two Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) VHA Explanations of Payment (EOP) issued on August 10, 2020.

Timeliness of an Appeal

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an appeal consists of a properly completed NOD on the form prescribed by the Secretary submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(b)(1)(A); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.2500(a)(1), 20.202, 20.203. A question as to the timeliness or adequacy of an NOD shall be decided by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C).  

An extension of the period for filing an NOD may be granted for good cause. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Id. When an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38?C.F.R. §?3.109(b). Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). 

Examples of good cause may include serious illness or injury of the appellant or representative, or the appellant's inability to access mail services due to homelessness, or overseas deployment. Examples that would not constitute good cause include change in representation, change in preference of a review option at the AOJ or among the Board review options, difficulty in obtaining evidence, or discovery of new evidence during a period in which the duty to assist does not apply. 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 155 (Jan. 18, 2019).

Request for an extension of time to file an appeal from two August 10, 2020, administrative decisions denying reimbursement for medical expenses provided in February 2020 and June 2020.

On March 4, 2024, the Appellant filed a Board Appeal request seeking to appeal two VHA administrative decisions issued on August 10, 2020, that denied reimbursement for medical expenses provided in February 2020 and June 2020. The appellant asserts that an extension should be granted because it was faced with extreme personnel issues due to the worldwide pandemic and was not able to go back and reconcile unpaid claims until 2024, and that their location suffered from historic wildfires and evacuations of clients and caregivers.

For the reasons explained below, the Board concludes that the attempted appeal was not timely and good cause has not been presented to warrant an extension of time to file an appeal from the VHA administrative decisions issued on August 10, 2020.

The VHA administrative decisions issued on August 10, 2020, show that payment in the amount of $0 was for medical services provided to the Veteran in February 2020 and in June 2020. They explained that no authorization number was submitted on the claims, which was a billing requirement for pre-approved care. The appellant was instructed to resubmit the claims with the authorization number. The decision notified the appellant that appeals "must be received within one year of the date of this [Explanation of Payment]," and included a link to a website with instructions on how to file an appeal to the Board. The VHA administrative decision was sent to the appellant and was not returned as undeliverable.

The Appellant's March 4, 2024, Board Appeal request was not timely filed because it was received more than one year after the August 10, 2020, VHA EOPs that denied reimbursement for medical services provided in February and June of 2020.

As noted above, the appellant asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file a Board Appeal request because it experienced personnel issues during the pandemic up until the time it submitted the March 4, 2024, Board Appeal request, and that wildfires resulted in evacuations of clients and caregivers. To the extent that the appellant is claiming that it did not have sufficient staff to go back and reconcile unpaid claims, the appellant failed to explain how any personnel issues would have impacted its ability to respond to the administrative decision issued on August 10, 2020, by filing an appeal within one year of its issuance, or by filing it earlier than it was. The Board acknowledges the appellant may have faced personnel issues due to the pandemic, however an assertion that a business experienced personnel difficulties does not show or explain why the appellant could not appeal the EOPs within the one-year period. Similarly, the presence of wildfires and evacuations of clients and caregivers does not sufficiently explain why the appellant could not have filed an appeal within one-year from the August 2020 EOPs or sooner than March 2024. No specific explanation has been provided as to how wildfires and evacuations would have impacted the appellant's ability to respond to the administrative decision issued on August 10, 2020, within one year, or during the over three years after the administrative decision was issued. Therefore, the Board finds that good cause has not been shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original period and could not have been taken sooner than it was.

Accordingly, the March 4, 2024, Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to the August 10, 2020, VHA administrative decisions denying reimbursement for medical services provided in February 2020 and June of 2020, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. The extension request is denied and the attempted appeal is dismissed.
