REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from September 1987 to September 2009. These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 Higher Level Review (HLR) decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The HLR decision was based on the record at the time of a December 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601.

In February 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, notice of disagreement (NOD), and elected direct review of the AOJ decision by the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. Under direct review, the Board considers the same record as that before the AOJ at the time of the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2602, 20.301.

Remand is permitted only to correct a pre-decisional error or for any other error the correction of which raises a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The Board finds that a claim for a finding of total disability based upon individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) has not been raised by the Veteran or the record on appeal at the time of the rating decision on appeal. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). He asserted in December 2023 that he was working, with no indication of a lack of substantially gainful employment. TDIU is not an issue on appeal.

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321 (a), 4.1.

In evaluating the severity of a disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found, however. This practice is known as "staged" ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability should be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

When evaluating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 allows for consideration of functional loss due to pain and weakness causing additional disability beyond that reflected on range of motion measurements. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995). Further, 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 provides that consideration also be given to decreased movement, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement, swelling, and deformity or atrophy of disuse. The intent of the rating schedule is to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. Painful motion is considered limited motion at the point that pain actually sets in. VAOPGCPREC 9-98.

Knees

The Veteran is seeking ratings in excess of 10 percent for his left and right knee tendonitis, respectively, and a rating in excess of 10 percent for his left knee meniscal disability. The Veteran's left and right knee tendonitis disabilities are currently evaluated under Code 5003- 5260 for limitation of flexion. His left knee meniscal disability is evaluated under Code 5003-5259 for symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. The Board notes the 10 percent disability evaluations currently assigned for right and left knee tendonitis, the minimal compensable evaluation for disabilities associated with the knee joint, are based on painful motion of the knee joints. See DeLuca.

There are numerous Codes which are potentially applicable to evaluation of knee disabilities. The Board notes that the rating criteria for musculoskeletal disorders were revised on February 7, 2021, and claims that were pending on this date must be considered under the former and revised criteria with the most favorable version applied to the claim (from the effective date of the change). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Codes 5256, 5257, 5258, 5259, 5260, 5261, 5262 (February 7, 2021).

Code 5256 is utilized for evaluation of ankylosis or the functional equivalent; as there is motion of the knees, this Code is not applicable here.

Code 5257 evaluates disabilities of the knee based on the degree of subluxation and instability of the joint. Under the former criteria, a 10 percent evaluation is assigned for slight, recurrent subluxation or lateral instability of the knee. A 20 percent evaluation is assigned for moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability of the knee. A 30 percent evaluation is assigned for severe recurrent subluxation or lateral instability of the knee. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5257.

Pursuant to the new criteria, Code 5257, recurrent subluxation, or lateral instability, assigns a 10 percent evaluation for sprain, incomplete ligament tear or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. A 20 percent evaluation is assigned for either (a) sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation; or (b) unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. A 30 percent evaluation is assigned for unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5257 (Effective February 7, 2021).

Additionally, pursuant to the new criteria for Code 5257, a 10 percent evaluation is assigned for patellar instability when the condition is diagnosed and involves the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without a history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provided for a brace, cane, or walker. A 20 percent evaluation is assigned for diagnosed patellar instability involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provided for one of the following: a brace, cane, or walker. A 30 percent evaluation is assigned for a diagnosed patellofemoral instability condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker. Note (1) to Code 5257 for patellar instability, defines the patellofemoral complex as consisting of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon. Note (2) specifies that a surgical procedure that does not involve repair of one or more patellofemoral components that contribute to underlying instability shall not qualify as surgical repair for patellar instability (including, but not limited to, arthroscopy to remove loose bodies and joint aspiration). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5257 (Effective February 7, 2021).

Code 5258 assigns a 20 percent evaluation for dislocated semilunar cartilage (the meniscus) with frequent episodes of "locking" pain, and effusion into the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5258.

Code 5259 assigns a 10 percent evaluation for symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5259.

For limitation of motion, there are two potentially applicable Codes; the rating criteria for these codes were unaffected by the new regulations. Code 5260 assigns evaluations based on limitation of flexion. Limitation to 60 degrees merits a noncompensable, or 0 percent, evaluation. A 10 percent evaluation is assigned for limitation to 45 degrees. Limitation to 30 degrees flexion warrants a 20 percent evaluation, and a 30 percent evaluation is assigned for limitation to 15 degrees of flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5260.

Limitation of extension is rated under Code 5261. Limitation to 5 degrees merits a noncompensable, or 0 percent, evaluation. A 10 percent evaluation is assigned for limitation to 10 degrees. Limitation to 15 degrees extension warrants a 20 percent evaluation. A 30 percent evaluation is assigned for limitation to 20 degrees of extension. A 40 percent evaluation is assigned for extension limited to 30 degrees. A 50 percent evaluation is assigned for extension limited to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5261.

Under the former criteria for Code 5262, tibia and fibula, impairment of, a 10 percent disability evaluation is assigned for malunion of with slight knee or ankle disability. A 20 percent disability evaluation is assigned for malunion with moderate knee or ankle disability. A 30 percent evaluation is assigned for malunion with marked knee or ankle disability. A 40 percent evaluation is assigned for nonunion of the tibia and fibular with loose motion, requiring brace. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5262.

Pursuant to the new criteria for Code 5262, for medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), or shin splints, a noncompensable evaluation is assigned for treatment for less than 12 consecutive months, one or both lower extremities. A 10 percent evaluation is assigned for MTSS or shin splints requiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, one or both lower extremities. A 20 percent evaluation is assigned for symptoms requiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, one lower extremity. A 30 percent evaluation is assigned for symptoms requiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, both lower extremities. Malunion of tibia and fibula is evaluated under Codes 5256, 5257, 5260, or 5261 for the knee, of 5270 or 5271 for the ankle whichever results in the highest evaluation. Nonunion of tibia and fibula with loose motion, requiring brace is assigned a 40 percent evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5262 (Effective February 7, 2021).

For VA purposes, normal range of knee is from 0 degrees of extension to 140 degrees of flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

VA treatment records reflect treatment for complaints of bilateral knee pain. 

Private medical records document the Veteran underwent a left knee arthroscopy in January 2022. The Veteran had reported experiencing increased swelling and pain in the past month which has gotten better with oral steroids. He complained of locking and catching of the left knee. The pain is mostly in the medial aspect of the knee.  

In March 2022, the Veteran underwent a VA knee and lower leg examination. The examination was scheduled to evaluate the Veteran's left knee tendonitis. The Veteran reported his symptoms had improved since he received an arthroscopic repair in January 2022. He reported experiencing an improvement in mobility. He reported experiencing numbness that extends from mid knee length to toes circumferentially down his left leg as well as tightness in his calf that causes pain with stair descent. He did not report experiencing flare-ups of the left knee. Functional loss and/or functional impairment was described as taking him an hour in the morning just to be able to walk because the left leg is so tight. The Veteran did not report a history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the left knee. He reported experiencing recent onset of gross swelling to lateral left knee associated with increased tightness in his joint and calf. Testing of the right knee was not performed. Range of motion of the left knee was flexion to 70 degrees, extension was to 0 degrees. Pain was noted on flexion. Range of motion was noted to contribute to a functional loss in that it limits squatting and lunging. Passive range of motion was noted to be the same as active range of motion. There was evidence of pain on both active and passive range of motion testing. There was objective evidence of crepitus noted. The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing which did not result in additional loss of function or range of motion after 3 repetitions. The Veteran was not being examined immediately after repeated use over time or on flare-up. Statements from the Veteran did not suggest that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance or incoordination limit functional ability with repeated use over time or on flare-up. No additional contributing factors of disability were noted. There was no muscle atrophy of the left knee and no ankylosis. There was no recurrent subluxation or persistent instability of the left knee. There was an incomplete/partial ligament tear of the left knee which underwent a complete repair what was successful. The Veteran does not require a prescription by a medical provider for any device to assist with ambulation. The Veteran does not have recurrent patellar instability of the left knee. The Veteran has no tibial of fibular impairment associated with the left knee. The Veteran had a left knee meniscal tear that was surgically repaired in January 2022. Residual symptoms include numbness, swelling and tightness in the left leg. The VA examiner noted ballotable swelling in the lateral left knee, with no erythema, warmth, or tenderness. The VA examiner noted that pain limits range of motion in the left knee, limiting squatting, lunging, and performance of high impact activities. 

The Veteran underwent a VA knee and lower leg examination in April 2023. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's left and right knee disabilities. The Veteran reported experiencing progressive bilateral knee pain. He underwent arthroscopic debridement and ACL construction of the left knee in January 2022 with subsequent complaints of persistent pain and decreased range of motion. Current symptoms include medial and lateral left knee pain and right "internal" knee pain with weight bearing, e.g. walking up stairs and taking long walks. The Veteran did not report experiencing flare-ups of the knees. Functional loss and/or functional impairment was described as, "I can walk to and from work, but I can't surf, run or hike." The Veteran reported that he gets swelling in the left knee with long walks. Range of motion of the right knee was flexion to 90 degrees and extension to 0 degrees. Active and passive range of motion was the same. Pain was exhibited in both ranges of motion, on both active and passive motion. Pain was noted to cause functional loss in that it limits high impact weight bearing activities. Objective evidence of crepitus was noted. There was no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint. Left knee range of motion was flexion to 90 degrees and extension to 0 degrees. Active and passive range of motion of the left knee was the same. Pain was exhibited in both ranges of motion, on both active and passive motion. Pain was noted to cause functional loss in that it limits high impact weight bearing activities. Objective evidence of crepitus was noted. There was no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint. Repetitive use testing did not result in additional loss of function or range of motion in either knee. The Veteran was not examined immediately after repeated use over time of during a flare-up for either knee. Statements from the Veteran did not suggest that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance or incoordination significantly limit functional ability with repeated use over time or during a flare-up. No additional contributing factors of disability were noted for either knee. There was no muscle atrophy, ankylosis, recurrent subluxation or persistent instability in either knee. The Veteran had an incomplete partial ligament tear in the left knee only; a complete tear repair was successful. The Veteran does not require a prescription for any devices to assist with ambulation. There was no patellar instability or tibial or fibular impairment in either knee. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's history of a left knee meniscal tear, with frequent episodes of joint effusion. The Veteran underwent arthroscopy in January 2022 and continues to experience residual symptoms of painful movement. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's January 2022 x-ray of the left knee which showed recent ACL reconstruction with expected postsurgical changes. A January 2022 MRI of the left knee showed degenerative medial meniscus tear and ACL partial tear. The Veteran's pain was noted to impact his functional ability as pain in both knees limits high impact weight bearing activities. 

VA treatment records through November 2022 note the Veteran continued to report experiencing bilateral knee pain.    

Left Knee Meniscal Disability 

The Board finds that the evidence supports a 20 percent evaluation pursuant to Code 5258 for the Veteran's left knee meniscal disability. January 2022 treatment notes reflect the Veteran's reports of locking in his left knee. His treatment records and VA examinations note continued complaints of pain and frequent episodes of effusion of his left knee after his January 2022 left knee meniscal repair. This is the maximum evaluation for dislocation of semilunar cartilage. There is no higher evaluation awarded under Code 5258. As no exceptional circumstances or symptoms have been raised, application of an extraschedular evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.321 is not appropriate.

Left and Right Knee Tendonitis

After a thorough review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against ratings in excess of 10 percent for the left and for the right knee tendonitis disabilities that are evaluated as limitation of flexion.  Range of motion testing showed flexion in the left knee was no less than 70 degrees, at most, and flexion in the right knee was limited to 90 degrees. The Veteran is in receipt of the current 10 percent ratings in each knee for painful motion. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms of pain with prolonged walking, standing, and squatting. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements that he had difficulty with squatting, as well as prolonged walking and standing, would not result in limitation of flexion more nearly approximating flexion limited to 30 degrees in either knee.

 The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the knee and leg. Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment).

The Veteran has not undergone a total knee replacement for either knee, therefore evaluations under Code 5055 are not for consideration.

Separate or higher ratings are not applicable under Diagnostic Code 5256, which applies to ankylosis as ankylosis in either knee has not been shown by the evidence of record.

Diagnostic Code 5262 applies to impairment of the tibia and fibula, which also has not been shown by the evidence of record in either knee. The evidence of record also does not reflect that the Veteran has impairment of the tibia and fibula in either knee, nor genu recurvatum, in either knee; therefore, Diagnostic Codes 5262 and 5263 do not apply in this case.

The Board has also considered whether a separate, additional rating under Diagnostic Code 5257 is warranted for instability. The Veteran has not reported experiencing instability of either knee, and such is not noted in the reports of his VA examinations.  Accordingly, the Veteran is not entitled to separate evaluations for instability of either knee. 

The Veteran does not have a meniscal disability of his right knee which would warrant consideration of an evaluation pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5258 or 5259. Accordingly, an evaluation under either of these Diagnostic Codes is not available for the Veteran's right knee.  

The Board notes the Veteran has had full extension of both knees throughout the period on appeal, therefore evaluations under Code 5261 are not available. 

All possibly applicable diagnostic codes have been considered in compliance with Schafrath, 1 Vet. App. at 593, but the Veteran cannot receive higher and/or additional evaluations other than the 10 percent evaluations previously assigned for left and right knee tendonitis and the increased 20 percent evaluation for the Veteran's left knee meniscal disability granted herein, based on the evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Right Shoulder 

The Veteran is seeking a rating in excess of 20 percent for his right shoulder disability. The Veteran is assigned an evaluation pursuant to Code 5003-5201. Code 5003-5201 assigns evaluations based on limitation of motion alone. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Here, the use of Code 5003 indicates the presence of arthritis, with limited motion.

The evidence of record shows that the Veteran is right-handed, therefore his right arm is the major extremity, and his left arm is the minor extremity. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.69. For VA purposes, normal range of arm motion is flexion 0 to 180 degrees; abduction 0 to 180 degrees; external rotation 0 to 90 degrees; and internal rotation 0 to 90 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate I.

Code 5003, for degenerative arthritis, does not permit assignment of an evaluation greater than 10 percent, and so will not be discussed further. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5003.

Code 5200 is utilized for scapulohumeral articulation, ankylosis of; as there is no ankylosis of the right shoulder, this Code is not applicable here. 

Code 5201 indicates the range of motion in degrees for flexion and abduction associated with each disability evaluation. A 20 percent evaluation is assigned for limitation of motion of the major arm to shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 90 degrees). A 30 percent evaluation is assigned for limitation of motion of the major arm limited to midway between the side and shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees). A 40 percent evaluation is assigned for limitation of motion of the major arm flexion and/or abduction limited to 25 degrees from side. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5201.

Under Code 5202, when there is malunion of the humerus in the major arm, a 20 percent rating is assigned with moderate deformity and a 30 percent rating is assigned with marked deformity. A 20 percent rating is also a 20 percent disability evaluation is assigned for recurrent dislocation of humerus at the scapulohumeral joint in the major arm with infrequent episodes and guarding of movement only at shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction at 90 degrees). A 30 percent rating is assigned with frequent episodes and guarding of all arm movements. A 50 percent rating is assigned when there is fibrous union of the arm; a 60 percent rating is assigned when there is nonunion of (false flail joint) the humerus in the arm; and an 80 percent rating is assigned when there is loss of head of (flail shoulder) the humerus in the arm. 

Code 5203, for impairment of clavicle or scapula, assigns a 10 percent evaluation is assigned for malunion of the clavicle or scapula, major or minor; or for nonunion of the clavicle or scapula without loose movement, major or minor. A 20 percent evaluation is assigned for nonunion of the clavicle or scapula with loose movement, major or minor; or for dislocation of the clavicle or scapula, major or minor.

VA treatment records dated October 2021 note complaints of chronic shoulder pain. 

The Veteran underwent a VA shoulder examination in April 2023. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's diagnosis of acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis, right shoulder. Current symptoms included lateral and internal right shoulder pain worse with prolonged sitting and working with a mouse. The Veteran noted an "associated sensation of right shoulder popping out of joint." The Veteran did not report experiencing flare-ups of the right shoulder or arm. The VA examiner noted that range of motion itself, contributed to a functional loss as it limits overhead motions. Right shoulder flexion was to 85 degrees, abduction was to 85 degrees, internal rotation was to 70 degrees and external rotation was to 60 degrees. Pain was exhibited in all ranges of motion and was present on both active and passive motion. There was no objective evidence of crepitus. There was objective evidence of mild localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint. The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing which did not result in additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions. The Veteran was not examined immediately after repeated use over time or during a flare-up. Statements obtained from the Veteran did not suggest that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance or incoordination significantly limits functional ability with repeated use over time or on flare-up. No additional contributing factors of disability were noted. No muscle atrophy or ankylosis was present.   

The Board has carefully considered all the evidence and potentially applicable diagnostic codes, including the DeLuca factors, and finds that the disability picture of the Veteran's right shoulder disability does not more nearly approximate the rating criteria at a higher disability level under Code 5201. Range of motion of the right shoulder flexion is limited to 85 degrees at most, even upon consideration of actual functional impairment under DeLuca. The Veteran does not experience limitation of motion of the arm that is limited to midway between side and shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees) which would warrant a 30 percent disability evaluation. Additionally, there is no ankylosis of the right shoulder (Code 5200) nor recurrent dislocations of the scapulohumeral joint with frequent episodes and guarding of all arm movements (Code 5202) which could warrant application of a rating in excess of 20 percent for the right shoulder.

Therefore, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's service-connected right shoulder disability is not warranted.

Lumbar Spine

The Veteran is seeking an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for his lumbar spine disability. The Veteran's lumbar spine disability is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242-5237. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Diagnostic Code 5242 pertains to degenerative arthritis of the spine and Diagnostic Code 5237 pertains to lumbosacral strain. Both Code 5242 and 5237 direct that evaluations of the lumbar spine are to be rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and injuries of the Spine or under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes, whichever results in a higher rating.

As discussed above, the rating criteria for musculoskeletal disorders were revised on February 7, 2021. However, the general rating criteria for diseases and injuries of the spine and the formula for rating intervertebral disc syndrome based on incapacitating episodes remain unchanged under the new rating criteria.

Pursuant to the general rating criteria for diseases and injuries of the spine, a 20 percent evaluation is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal, kyphosis. A 40 percent evaluation is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. A higher evaluation of 50 percent is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. The highest evaluation of 100 percent is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5242, 5237.

Pursuant to the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes, a 20 percent evaluation is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks during the past 12 months. A 40 percent evaluation is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks during the past 12 months. A 60 percent evaluation is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the past 12 months. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.

An ''incapacitating episode" is a period of acute signs and symptoms due to intervertebral disc syndrome that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243, Note 1.

VA regulations define normal range of motion of the lumbar spine as flexion to 90 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, lateral flexion to 30 degrees, and rotation to 30 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate V.

Diagnostic Code 5237 applies to lumbosacral or cervical strain under the former criteria and the new criteria. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5237.

Under the former rating criteria, Diagnostic Code 5242 evaluated Degenerative arthritis of the Spine (see also diagnostic code 5003). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5242 (2020).

Under the new criteria, Code 5242 applies to Degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (also, see either diagnostic code 5003 or 5010). See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242 (Effective February 7, 2021).

Under the former rating criteria, Diagnostic Code 5243 evaluated IVDS. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5243 (2020).

Under the new criteria, Code 5243 still applies to Intervertebral disc syndrome; but more specifically as this code is only to be assigned when there is disc herniation with compression and/or irritation of the adjacent nerve root; assign diagnostic code 5242 for all other disc diagnoses. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243 (Effective February 7, 2021). 

The Board finds that the appropriate Diagnostic Code for the evaluating the Veteran's lumbar spine disability, based on the new regulations, is Diagnostic Code 5242, Degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease other than IVDS.

VA treatment records reflect the Veteran reported experiencing chronic pain in his back. 

The Veteran underwent a VA spine examination April 2023. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's diagnosis of lumbar facet degenerative joint disease. The Veteran reported that he experiences constant back pain that is worse with prolonged standing and exertion. The Veteran did not report experiencing flare-ups. Functional loss and/or functional impairment was described as difficulty standing for long periods, and with any lifting or exercise. Range of motion was forward flexion to 60 degrees, extension to 20 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 15 degrees bilaterally and right and left lateral rotation to 15 degrees bilaterally. Pain was noted on all ranges of motion. Passive range of motion was not performed because it was medically contraindicated. Pain was noted on active range of motion which caused functional loss. There was no objective evidence of crepitus or localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue. The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing which did not result in additional loss of function or range of motion. The Veteran was not being examined immediately after repeated use over time or on a flare-up. Statements from the Veteran did not suggest that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance or incoordination limit functional ability with repeated use over time or on flare-up. Muscle strength test results, reflex examination test results, and sensory examination test results were all normal. The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy or ankylosis. The Veteran had no signs or symptoms of radiculopathy. The VA examiner determined that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of IVDS.  

The Board has carefully considered all the evidence and potentially applicable diagnostic codes, including the DeLuca factors, and finds that the disability picture of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability does not more nearly approximated the rating criteria of a higher disability level. Motion was, at worst, limited to forward flexion to 60 degrees, warranting the currently assigned 20 percent rating, even upon consideration of the functional impact of pain with use and on flare-ups. Notably, the Veteran did not report experiencing flare-ups; therefore, the overall disability picture is best represented by the measured degree of motion in flexion, which considers the actual functional impairment due to the DeLuca factors. Flexion is not reduced to less than 30 degrees, nor did the Veteran experience incapacitating episodes to warrant assignment of a yet higher rating. The Board finds that the overall disability is not severe enough to warrant assignment of an evaluation in excess of 20 percent.

Therefore, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's service-connected lumbar spine disability is not warranted. In addition, the Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt but has determined that it is not applicable because the weight of the evidence is against the claim for a higher rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.21.

Surgical Scars, Left Knee

The Veteran is seeking a compensable evaluation for a surgical scar of left knee. The scar is assigned noncompensable evaluation pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

The scar in question is not on the face, therefore the criteria for rating scars under Diagnostic Code 7800 are inapplicable.

Code 7801, for scars other than those on the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage, assigns a 10 percent rating is warranted if the area is at least 6 square inches (39 sq. cm) but less than 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.). A 20 percent rating is assigned for an area or areas of at least 12 square inches (77 sq. cm. but less than 72 square inches (465 sq. cms). A 30 percent rating is warranted if the area is at least 72 square inches (465 sq. cm) but less than 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.). A 40 percent rating is warranted if the area is at least 144 square inches (929 sq. cm) or greater. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Code 7801 (2019).

Pursuant to the criteria associated with Code 7802, a scar at a location other than the head, face, or neck that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage would have to have an area exceeding 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) to warrant a 10 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

The rating criteria associated with Code 7804, for unstable or painful scars, provides for a 10 percent disability rating for one or two scars are unstable or painful. A 20 percent rating is assigned for three or four scars that are unstable or painful. The highest evaluation, 30 percent is assigned for five or more scars that are unstable or painful. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804. An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804, Note (1). If one or more scars are both unstable and painful, add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804, Note (2). Scars evaluated under Diagnostic Code 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7804, when applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804, Note (3).

Diagnostic Code 7805 states any disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under diagnostic codes 7800 through 7804 are to be rated under an appropriate diagnostic code.

The Veteran underwent a VA scars examination in March 2022. The Veteran reported undergoing a left knee arthroscopy, ACL reconstruction using allograft ad meniscus debridement in January 2022. The VA examiner noted the following scars: on the lateral knee measuring 3.7 x 1 cms, on the anterior knee measuring 1 x 0.1 cms, on the medial knee measuring 0.7 x 0.2 cms, and on the inferior knee measuring 3 x 0.1 cms. The scars were not tender to palpation, were not unstable and did not have underlying soft tissue damage. The VA examiner noted that the scars covered a total approximate area of 4.24 cms.    

At the Veteran's April 2023 VA knee examination, the VA examiner noted the Veteran's scar on his left knee.

The Veteran underwent a VA scars examination in April 2023. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's surgical scar on his left knee. The scar is not painful or unstable and does not have a total area equal to or greater than 39 square cms. The VA examiner measured the scars on the Veteran's left knee as totalling 3.9 square cms.  

VA treatment records are negative for treatment for complaints of symptoms relating to the Veteran's surgical scar, left knee.

After a thorough review of the file, the Board finds that the Veteran's surgical scar left knee does not meet the criteria for a compensable evaluation. The medical evidence of record establishes that the scar is not deep, nonlinear, painful to touch, unstable, or nor covers an area of 144 square inches.

Hemorrhoids

The Veteran is seeking a compensable evaluation for hemorrhoids. The Veteran is assigned a noncompensable evaluation for hemorrhoids under Diagnostic Code 7336. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7336.

During the pendency of the appeal, VA published amendments to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, the Schedule of Ratings for the Digestive System, effective May 19, 2024. If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the claimant will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); see also Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

Pursuant to the former rating criteria associated with Diagnostic Code 7336, a noncompensable rating is warranted for mild or moderate external or internal hemorrhoids. A 10 percent rating is warranted for large or thrombotic hemorrhoids, irreducible, with excessive redundant tissue, evidencing frequent recurrences. A 20 percent rating is warranted when there are hemorrhoids with persistent bleeding and with secondary anemia, or with fissures.

Under the amended criteria for Code 7336, a 10 percent rating is warranted for prolapsed internal hemorrhoids with two or less episodes per year of thrombosis; or external hemorrhoids with three or more episodes per year of thrombosis. A 20 percent rating is warranted for internal or external hemorrhoids with persistent bleeding and anemia; or continuously prolapsed internal hemorrhoids with three or more episodes per year of thrombosis.

VA treatment records are negative for treatment for symptoms of hemorrhoids. 

The Veteran underwent a VA rectum and anus examination in February 2022. The Veteran declined a rectal/anal examination. Th Veteran reported that his hemorrhoid symptoms flare-up about once a month and consist of pain, itching, burning, tenesmus, and bleeding with every stool. The Veteran reported using topical cream for this condition. The VA examiner noted the Veteran has mild internal hemorrhoids with persistent bleeding. 

The Veteran underwent a VA rectum and anus examination in April 2023. The Veteran reported experiencing current symptoms including frequent bright red blood per rectum with bowel movements as well as anal pruritus and swelling. The Veteran uses Preparation H on an as needed basis. The Veteran does not take continuous medication for his hemorrhoids. The Veteran declined a physical rectal examination. The VA examiner determined the Veteran had mild or moderate internal or external hemorrhoids. The Veteran had no benign or malignant neoplasms or metastases related to his hemorrhoids. 

After a thorough review of the file, the Board finds that the Veteran's hemorrhoid disability does not meet the criteria for a compensable evaluation under either the former or the amended rating criteria. The medical evidence of record establishes that hemorrhoids are mild or moderate; there is no evidence associated with record that indicates the hemorrhoids are large, thrombotic, or irreducible, hemorrhoids with excessive redundant tissue, evidencing frequent recurrences, or with persistent bleeding, secondary anemia, or fissures.  Therefore, the Board finds that a compensable rating for hemorrhoids is not warranted.
