ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right ear hearing loss disability is denied.

Entitlement to an initial 10 percent rating, but no higher, for a right thumb disability is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a left ear hearing loss disability is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record during the relevant period weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran has a right ear hearing loss disability pursuant to VA regulation.

2. The evidence of record during the relevant period weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's right thumb disability is manifested by a gap of two inches or more between the thumb pad and fingers; ankylosis; amputation; or functional impairment such that no effective functions remain other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation with prosthesis.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for the establishment of service connection for a right ear hearing loss disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

2. An initial evaluation of 10 percent, but no higher, for a right thumb disability is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5228.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2009 to July 2014.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the June 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  Id. 

38 C.F.R. §?3.103 provides that a Veteran, upon request, is entitled to a hearing prior to VA's adjudication of an initial or supplemental claim.? The Board observes that notice regarding the opportunity for a hearing at the AOJ was not provided in this case.  In Bowen, the Court found that there was no due process violation in the denial of the Veteran's requested?hearing?before the?AOJ?because the Veteran had subsequently been offered the opportunity to have a?hearing?before the Board. Bowen v. Shinseki,?25?Vet. App.?250, 253?(2012).  Here, the Veteran was offered a choice of three dockets in the AMA framework to include the Board hearing docket.  Although the issue in?Bowen?was not one of notice, the Board cannot discern a basis to find that the underlying holding and logic of Bowen would not lead to the same finding of a lack of prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case. 

The Board notes that the AOJ requested the Veteran submit any relevant private treatment records or submit information with which VA can assist the Veteran in obtaining private treatment records.  Required notice and information were provided in the claim form which the Veteran signed, certifying to the fact that such notice was received and further that they have included or identified relevant evidence.  VA requested records for which the Veteran submitted a proper release and/or adequately identified. The?duty to assist?is not a one-way?street.  If a veteran desires help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining evidence. Wood v. Derwinski,?1?Vet. App.?190 (1991).  Thus, the Board finds that VA has satisfied the duty to assist.  No further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in development.  Smith v. Gober,?14?Vet. App.?227?(2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi,?15?Vet. App.?143 (2001); Quartuccio v. Principi,?16?Vet. App.?183 (2002). 

The standard set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) only permits constructive receipt of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records that not only existed prior to the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal, but also for which the claimant furnished sufficient information to make the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) aware of the existence of those records. Thus, the Board's consideration of VHA records is limited to the same.? Here, the Board finds that VA treatment records were obtained and reviewed consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) and the AMA framework. 

Service Connection Claims

Service connection may be established for disability due to a disease or injury that was incurred in or aggravated by active military service.? 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.? Service connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).?? 

In general, in order to prevail on the issue of service connection the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.? Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).? 

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection.? Brammer?v. Derwinski,?3?Vet. App.?223, 225?(1992).? The requirement that a current disability be present is satisfied "when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim... even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim."? McClain?v. Nicholson,?21?Vet. App.?319, 321?(2007).??? 

Right Ear Hearing Loss Disability

The Veteran is claiming he has a bilateral hearing loss disability which he believes is related to service.? See August 2023 FDC.  The claim for a left ear hearing loss disability is being remanded to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  The Board is adjudicating the issue of a right ear hearing loss disability.

In the April 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise during service.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Under VA regulation, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when: (1) the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; (2) the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz are 26 decibels or greater; or (3) when the speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.385.????? 

At a March 2024 audiological examination, the Veteran's right ear speech discrimination score were 94 percent.? Audiometric testing yielded the following results:? 

? 	 	 	HERTZ 	 	 

 	  500 	  1000 	  2000 	  3000 	  4000 

  RIGHT 	  15 	  10 	  10 	  15 	  10 

Here, the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran has a right ear hearing loss disability as defined by VA regulation.? See 38?C.F.R. §?3.385.? Significantly, when examining the auditory thresholds in the 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz frequencies, none are over 40 decibels and there is no evidence of frequencies at 26 decibels or higher in at least three of those thresholds.? See id.? Moreover, the speech discrimination score for the right ear is not less than 94 percent.? See id.????? 

The Board recognizes that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms of hearing loss that he experiences, as this requires only personal knowledge, and the Board does not doubt that he has difficulty hearing.? See Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 470 (1994).? Despite the foregoing, as a lay person, the Veteran's statements are not competent evidence to determine whether he has a right ear hearing loss disability as defined by VA regulation as the criteria for evaluating hearing impairment rely exclusively on objective test results.? See 38?C.F.R. §§?3.159(a), 3.385; see also Martinak v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?447, 455 (2007).? 

Absent a current diagnosis of a right ear hearing loss disability pursuant to VA regulation, the Veteran's claim must be denied as a matter of law.? See 38?C.F.R. §?3.385;?see also Brammer, 3?Vet. App. at 225; McClain, 21?Vet. App. at 321.????? 

Increased Rating Claim

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).? 38?C.F.R. Part 4.? The Rating Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.? The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §?4.1.? Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.7.? When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.3.???

With respect to increased ratings for musculoskeletal claims, in determining the degree of limitation of motion, the provisions of 38?C.F.R. §?4.40 concerning lack of normal endurance, functional loss due to pain, and pain on use and during flare-ups; the provisions of 38?C.F.R. §?4.45 concerning weakened movement, excess fatigability, and incoordination; and the provisions of 38?C.F.R. §?4.10 concerning the effects of the disability on the veteran's ordinary activity are for consideration.? See 38 C.F.R. §?4.59, see also DeLuca v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?202 (1995); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?32 (2011).???????  

Right Thumb Disability

The Veteran is claiming a compensable initial evaluation is warranted for his right thumb disability.  See June 2024 VA Form 10182.

By way of history, in October 2020, the Veteran sustained a laceration of his right hand; there was no need for suture, it was covered with Bacitracin and bandaged, and he was instructed to return to medical for any signs of infection at the site or for any other concerns.  The Veteran has reported that since this incident, he has had pain, loss of grip strength, and periodic loss of range of motion.? See August 2023 FDC.

The Veteran's right thumb disability is rated under Diagnostic Code 5228, which specifically contemplates the thumb based on limitation of motion.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Under this diagnostic code, a noncompensable rating is warranted when there is a gap of less than one inch (2.5 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers.  Id.  A 10 percent rating is warranted when there is a gap of less than one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers.  Id.  A 20 percent rating is warranted when there is a gap of more than two inches (5.1 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers.  Id.

At a January 2024 examination, in describing the course of this disability since onset, the Veteran reported he felt like his right thumb was going to slip out at points and that he felt pain at pressure points.  It was noted the Veteran is right hand dominant.  Regarding current symptoms, the Veteran reported muscle spasm or like this thumb is going to pop out of place; he also reported instability of the thumb and stated he was unable to tighten things or use his hand with thumb movement to do certain jobs.  He denied flare-ups.  On examination, range of motion of the right thumb was normal and was unchanged with repetitive use testing; there was no gap between the pad of the thumb and fingers on active or passive range of motion testing.  The Veteran reported that incoordination and instability caused functional loss.  The examiner estimated no additional loss of range of motion with repetitive use and no gap between the pad of the thumb and fingers with repetitive use.  Right hand grip was normal (5/5), and there was no muscle atrophy.  There was no ankylosis of any of the right thumb joints.  The examiner found that the Veteran's right thumb disability was not manifested by functional impairment such that no effective functions remain other than that which would be equally well served by amputation.  The examiner diagnosed right thumb instability (chronic collateral ligament sprain).

Here, the objective physical findings at the January 2024 examination weigh persuasively against a finding there is a gap between the right thumb and fingers of the right hand.  The Veteran has, however, reported a painful joint, specifically, his right thumb.  See August 2023 FDC.  Notably, the intent of the rating schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability; thus, it is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59; see Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011).  In Petitti v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 415 (2015), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) rejected VA's argument that § 4.59 requires painful motion, such that the mere presence of joint pain is not sufficient.  Id. at 428-29. The Court held that under § 4.59, "the trigger for a minimum disability rating is an actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joint," explaining that § 4.59 speaks to both painful motion of joints and actually painful joints.  Id. at 425; see also Southall-Norman v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 346, 354 (2016) ("The plain language of § 4.59 indicates that it is applicable to the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities involving actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints or periarticular regions, regardless of whether the DC under which the disability is being evaluated is predicated on range of motion measurements.").  Moreover, the Court held that § 4.59 does not require "objective" evidence but can be satisfied with lay and other non-medical evidence.  Petitti, 27 Vet. App. at 429 

Given the Veteran's report of pain in the right thumb, the Board finds the minimum compensable rating, a 10 percent rating, is warranted pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  The next higher 20 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5228 is not warranted as the evidence of record weighs persuasively against a finding that when there is a gap of more than two inches (5.1 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers.

The Board has considered other diagnostic codes pertaining to the thumb to evaluate whether rating the Veteran's disability under a different diagnostic code would afford him a rating in excess of 10 percent and finds it would not.  

The Veteran has not had his right thumb amputated and the January 2024 examiner found the Veteran's right thumb disability was not manifested by functional impairment such that no effective functions remain other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation with prosthesis; thus, Diagnostic Code 5152, which contemplates thumb amputation, is not applicable.  The evidence of record also weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's right thumb disability is manifested by ankylosis, and therefore, Diagnostic Code 5224, which contemplates thumb ankylosis does not apply.  

Based on the foregoing, an initial 10 percent evaluation, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's right thumb disability.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR REGIONAL OFFICE (RO) ADJUDICATOR:

The record suggests that the Veteran may have had toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) participation during service.  Specifically, the record shows the Veteran received hazardous duty incentive pay, hostile fire/imminent danger pay, and a combat zone tax exclusion at various times from 2010 to 2012.  His DD-214 shows he received the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.  Further, his personnel records show he had service aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72), which was, at times, deployed to the Arabian Sea, and also had service aboard the USS Ronald Reagan.  No development has been undertaken to determine whether the Veteran had TERA participation during service.  This is a remand to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The record contains two separate March 2024 negative opinions regarding the left ear hearing loss disability, which are both predicated a lack of demonstrated hearing loss during service and at separation from service (to include no finding of a "notch" at 6000 Hertz at separation); therefore, they are inadequate.  This is a remand to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

THE REMAND DIRECTIVES FOLLOW.

2. Conduct the necessary development to determine whether the Veteran had TERA participation during service and, if so, identify the nature of the TERA participation.

3. Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the etiology of his left ear hearing loss disability.

Following an examination and a review of the record, provide the following opinion: 

Opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss disability had its onset in or is otherwise etiologically related to active service.  Why or why not?

An opinion predicated solely on a finding that there was no hearing loss disability during service or at separation from service will be inadequate.

The examiner must review the entire record in conjunction with rendering the requested opinions.? The examiner's attention is drawn, but not limited to, the following evidence:???

"	At the March 2024 audiological examination, the Veteran reported in-service noise exposure working on the flight line and flight deck.  Examination results revealed he has a left ear hearing loss disability pursuant to VA regulation (speech discrimination score was 88 percent).

"	In the April 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise during service.

The Board notes that the claims folder must be provided to and reviewed by the examiner for all post-remand cases per AOJ policy.  See VBA Manual M21-1, Part IV.i.2.A.8.b.  Thus, the examiner must specifically note that the claims folder was received and reviewed in the body of the examination report. 

The examiner is informed by the Board that chronicity is not required to find a nexus to service or for service connection to be granted.

The examiner is informed that a positive opinion indicating a nexus to service does not require certainty.  Rather, if the weight of the evidence is in approximate balance for and against a nexus to service, the examiner should make a determination favorable to the Veteran.

All requested opinions must be supported with a rationale based on generally accepted medical principles and the examiner's medical training and expertise.
