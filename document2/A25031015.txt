DOCKET NO. 230608-387701
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is dismissed.

The appeal for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

The request for an extension of time in which to file the Notice of Disagreement as to the issues of service connection for OSA and PTSD is moot.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's appeal of the claims for service connection for OSA and PTSD is an improper concurrent election because the Veteran had a pending supplemental claim at the time he submitted the instant appeal.

2. The Veteran's request for an extension of time in which to docket this appeal is moot.

3. The Veteran is not entitled to a Board hearing in an improperly docketed appeal.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissing the appeal for service connection for OSA, and the request for extension of time to file this appeal is moot, are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for dismissing the appeal for service connection for PTSD, and the request for extension of time to file this appeal is moot, are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from November 1988 to November 1992.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2020 rating decision by a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office that in pertinent part denied service connection for OSA and PTSD.  In June 2023, the Veteran submitted an untimely Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, VA Form 10182 with a request for an extension of time due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Veteran elected the Hearing docket; however, no hearing was held because the case is improperly docketed at the Board.

The Board previously dismissed this appeal in a November 2023 decision.  The Veteran appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In an October 2024 Joint Motion for Remand (JMR), the parties agreed that the Board provided an inadequate statement of reasons and bases for dismissing the claim because it failed to address the Veteran's request for a Board hearing.  In an October 2024 Order, the Court granted the parties' JMR vacating the Board decision and remanded the claim to the Board for further adjudication.

Concurrent review of the same VA decision under different appeal lanes is prohibited by law.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023) (holding that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option").  In other words, only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues.  Id.

By way of background, the Veteran was denied service connection for OSA and PTSD in a June 2020 rating decision, which is the rating decision on appeal in this matter.  In September 2021, the Veteran's representative submitted a VA Form 10182 attempting to appeal "each and every issue listed on any decision issued within the last year," even though no rating decisions had been issued in that time.  That VA Form 10182 was therefore not a valid appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (requiring a Notice of Disagreement to "identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees").  Admittedly, the Board's request for clarification of this VA Form 10182 was sent to the Veteran and his prior representative; however, the Veteran's learned counsel knows that a such a vague statement is not a valid appeal and that such appeal could have been amended or supplemented upon reviewing the file.  

Rather than amending or supplementing that September 2021 VA Form 10182, however, in August 2022, the Veteran's representative elected to submit a VA Form 21-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.  That supplemental claim remained pending on June 3, 2023, when the Veteran's representative submitted the VA Form 10182 on appeal in this case; the supplemental claim was not adjudicated until a June 23, 2023 rating decision granting service connection for PTSD and continuing the denial of service connection for OSA.  Accordingly, because the Veteran's supplemental claim was pending at the time he submitted the VA Form 10182 at issue in this matter, this appeal to the Board is an improper concurrent election. 

?

If the Veteran wished to pursue a Board appeal in this matter, the Veteran should have and could have withdrawn the pending supplemental claim prior to submitting the VA Form 10182.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(d), (e) (allowing a claimant to withdraw a supplemental claim and change a review option).  Indeed, the Veteran and/or his representative chose not to pursue a Board appeal for these claims on two separate occasions in this case.  First, the Veteran and/or his representative chose not to amend or supplement the vague September 2021 VA Form 10182 and instead elected to file the August 2022 supplemental claim.  Second, the Veteran and/or his representative elected not to withdraw that supplemental claim when the June 2023 VA Form 10182 was submitted.

As the Court noted in Hall v. McDonough, although the Board cannot dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction, it may dismiss an appeal for a procedural defect.  See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021) (holding that the Board may not dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction but may consider dismissing it for other non-jurisdictional reasons such as a procedural defect).  In this regard, as the Board docketed an impermissible concurrent election in this appeal, such is a procedural defect, and the Board may dismiss this claim at this time.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.104; Terry, supra; Hall, supra.  The claim is accordingly dismissed.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's request for an extension of time in which to file his appeal of the June 2020 rating decision.  However, because this matter has been dismissed as an improperly docketed appeal, the Veteran's request for an extension of time is moot because there is no case or controversy remaining before the Board for consideration.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5).  

As to the basis for vacatur and remand by the Court, because this matter should not have been docketed before the Board in the first instance, no Board hearing has been or will be conducted.  In this regard, the Board is unaware of any right to a Board hearing in an improperly docketed appeal.  In other words, because the present VA Form 10182 is not a validly docketed appeal, the case is being dismissed for this reason and the right to a hearing does not accrue to an appeal until it has been validly and properly docketed in the Hearing lane.

The Board notes, however, that the Veteran is not without recourse as a result of this dismissal.  The Veteran has continued to pursue these claims from the June 2023 rating decision, most recently in a September 2023 VA Form 10182, which has been docketed with the Board.  The Veteran elected the Hearing Docket in that VA Form 10182 and will therefore have a right to a Board hearing in that presumably properly docketed appeal.
