ORDER

Service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, claimed as a nerve injury, is granted.

Service connection for migraine headaches is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy started in service.

2. The Veteran's migraines started in service and have continued during the claim period.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 3.310.  

2. The criteria for service connection for migraines are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2016 to March 2022.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

Following the January 2024 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) and selected the Direct Review Docket. Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of January 8, 2024-the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that the Veteran listed bilateral lower extremity nerve issue as an issue on appeal in the Notice of Disagreement, but the January 2024 rating decision only adjudicated service connection for a right lower extremity nerve injury.  Service connection for a left lower extremity nerve condition was adjudicated in a June 1, 2023 rating decision, and notification was mailed to the Veteran on June 8, 2023.  As the Notice of Disagreement was submitted more than a year after notification of the June 2023 rating decision, the claim for service connection for a left lower extremity nerve condition is not properly before the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).  The Board also notes that, following the submission of the Notice of Disagreement, the RO granted service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy in a September 2024 rating decision, effective June 13, 2024.  As this grant of service connection does not cover the claim period at issue on this appeal, it is not considered a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal, and the matter remains before the Board. 

Service Connection

Generally, service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from a disease or injury incurred in active military service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection requires evidence of a current disability, an in-service incurrence, disease or injury and a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service incurrence, disease or injury.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). 

Service connection may also be granted where a disability is proximately due to or aggravated by an already service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  To establish secondary service connection for a disability there must be (1) a current disability (for which secondary service connection is sought); (2) an existing service-connected disability, and (3) evidence that the current disability for which service connection is sought was either (a) caused or (b) aggravated by the service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc).  

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  To deny a claim on its merits, the evidence must preponderate against the claim. Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996).  

Right Lower Extremity Radiculopathy

The Veteran contends that his right lower extremity radiculopathy is related to an injury that occurred on active duty that required spinal surgery.  The record reflects that the Veteran experienced radiculopathy in service.  Specifically, a September 2021 service treatment record (STR) documents the primary diagnosis as spondylosis with radiculopathy.  The Veteran is also service connected for lumbar spine surgery since his discharge from service in March 2022.  Based on the foregoing, the Veteran is able to establish the first and second elements for secondary service connection.  The Board also acknowledges that, in the September 2023 rating decision, the RO favorably found that the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy was related to his service-connected lumbar spine surgery.  The Board notes that, under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), any finding favorable to a veteran is binding on all subsequent VA adjudicators, unless the finding is rebutted by evidence of a clear and unmistakable error (CUE). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  As there is no evidence of a CUE in this context, the Board finds the nexus requirement has been satisfied.  Accordingly, service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, claimed as a nerve injury, is granted.  

Migraine Headaches

When a condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, as is the case with headaches, the presence of the disorder is not a determination "medical in nature," and is capable of lay observation.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 305 (2007); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  As headaches are identifiable by a layperson by their unique features, the remaining inquiry is whether the Veteran's current headaches are related to service.

When a claim involves a diagnosis based on purely subjective complaints, the Board is within its province to weigh the Veteran's testimony and determine whether it supports a finding of service incurrence and continued symptoms since service.  See Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 305.  If it does, such testimony is sufficient to establish service connection.  Id.

The Veteran contends that his migraine headache condition started on active duty and that he continues to experience multiple migraines per month. See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation).  The Veteran described the headaches as "prostrating."  VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran continues to treat his headaches with ibuprofen.  The Board finds no reason to doubt the credibility of the Veteran's statements.  Therefore, the Board finds his account of the in-service onset of headaches and their continuation thereafter both competent and credible.  As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements are sufficient to establish service connection in this instance.

The Board acknowledges that the May 2023 VA examiner reported that the Veteran did not have headaches, based on the Veteran's report.  The Veteran has subsequently made clear that his claim is for migraines and that he has experienced them since, and that the condition should have been observed by the examiner.  Thus, despite any confusion over the claim expressed at the VA examination, the Board relies on the Veteran's competent and credible statements regarding his experience of migraines during and since service.  The May 2023 VA examination is not probative.  

Resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, the claim of entitlement to service connection for migraines is granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another, is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
