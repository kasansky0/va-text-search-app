ORDER

Eligibility for the direct payment of fees based on past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran pursuant to a September 2023 rating decision is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's March 2014 appointment of the Appellant as agent (the "March 2014 Appointment") and the June 2015 fee agreement between the Veteran and the Appellant (the "June 2015 Fee Agreement") are valid for purposes of the award of fees. 

2. A March 2015 rating decision (the "March 2015 Rating Decision") that denied service connection for the Veteran's right knee disability constitutes the initial decision on the issue of service connection for the right knee disability.

3. In March 2015, the Appellant filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) with the March 2015 Rating Decision on behalf of the Veteran seeking service connection for the Veteran's right knee disability (the "March 2015 NOD"). 

4. In November 2017, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a statement of the case (SOC) denying service connection for the right knee disability (the "November 2017 SOC"), and in December 2017, the Appellant filed a VA Form 9 Appeal to the Board ("the December 2017 Appeal") on behalf of the Veteran seeking review of the November 2017 SOC, including service connection for the right knee disability. 

5. In a September 2023 rating decision issued following a Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) remand, the AOJ awarded service connection for the right knee disability and assigned the following disability ratings: (a) a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5003-5260, effective March 31, 2014; and (b) a noncompensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5261, effective May 5, 2023 (the "September 2023 Rating Decision").

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility for fees paid to the Appellant based on past-due benefits awarded in the September 2023 Rating Decision have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904 (2015).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a December 2023 fee decision (the "December 2023 Fee Decision") issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) AOJ, which constitutes an initial decision on the issue of agent fees; therefore, the modernized review system, governed by the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

The Appellant represents the Veteran before VA but does not represent the Veteran in the current matter, because the Appellant is the contesting claimant.  

In January 2024, the Appellant timely filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (the "January 2024 NOD") in response to the December 2023 Fee Decision on appeal and elected the Direct Review docket.  In January 2024, the Veteran was provided with a redacted copy of the Appellant's January 2024 NOD pursuant to contested claims procedures (the "January 2024 Notice"); however, the Veteran has not filed a response to the January 2024 NOD or elected to change the docket.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.403, 20.404.  Therefore, this contested claim remains on the Direct Review docket, and the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 Fee Decision on appeal and a brief or argument filed by the Veteran within thirty (30) days of the January 2024 Notice.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.405.  

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.

AGENT FEES

Eligibility for the direct payment of fees based on past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran pursuant to the September 2023 Rating Decision is granted.

The Appellant asserts that the direct payment of fees is warranted based upon the September 2023 Rating Decision which granted service connection for the right knee disability and assigned the following disability ratings: (a) a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5003-5260, effective March 31, 2014; and (b) a noncompensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5261, effective May 5, 2023.

After careful review, and for the reasons set forth below, the Board agrees and finds that the Appellant is eligible for the direct payment of fees based on past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran pursuant to the September 2023 Rating Decision, and the claim is granted.

VA claimants are permitted to appoint an attorney or agent as representative in connection with the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904.  In order to appoint an attorney or agent as representative, the claimant must submit a validly executed VA Form 21-22a, Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative, which must meet the following requirements: (1) the form must be signed by (a) the claimant; (b) the claimant's guardian; or (c) in the case of an incompetent, minor, or otherwise incapacitated person without a guardian, the claimant's spouse, parent, other relative or friend (if interests are not adverse), or the director of the hospital in which the claimant is maintained; (2) the form must be signed by the attorney or agent providing representation; and (3) the form must be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the claims file.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a). 

The claimant may revoke a power of attorney and discharge an attorney or agent at any time, and, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the receipt of a new VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a executed by the claimant and the representative shall constitute revocation of an existing power of attorney.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1).

In order to be valid, all fee agreements between a claimant and an attorney or agent must be in writing, signed by both the claimant and the representative, and must include the following: (1) the name of the veteran; (2) if other than the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant; (3) the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the veteran, claimant, or appellant; (4) the applicable VA file number; and (5) the specific criteria for determining the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d).

Fee agreements must also clearly specify whether VA shall pay the attorney or agent directly out of past-due benefits ("direct-pay fee agreement").   See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g)(2).  A fee agreement that does not clearly specify that VA is to directly pay the attorney or agent out of past-due benefits or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded by VA shall be considered to be an agreement in which the attorney or agent is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant without assistance from VA.  See id.   A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within thirty (30) days of its execution.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g)(3).  

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of attorneys or agents with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1) (2015); see also Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28, 32-34 (2023).

Regarding initial decisions issued prior to February 19, 2019, as is the case here, attorneys or agents may charge claimants or appellants for representation provided to the claimant or appellant where: (1) the AOJ has issued a decision on a claim or claims, including any request to reopen a claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a) or for an increased rating; (2) the AOJ has issued notice of that decision prior to February 19, 2019, the effective date of the modernized review system; (3) a notice of disagreement has been filed with respect to that decision on or after June 20, 2007; and (4) the attorney or agent has complied with the power of attorney requirements in 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 and the fee agreement requirements in 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1) (2015).

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the attorney or agent (i) is to be paid to the attorney or agent by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d).  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(1), (2).  Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded shall be presumed to be reasonable if the representation continued through the date of the decision awarding benefits.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f)(1).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by the AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  Attorney or agent fees may be calculated based on the total amount of past-due benefits awarded to the veteran regardless of the amount actually paid to the veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264, 269 (2020).

Where the benefit granted on appeal or as the result of the readjudicated claim involves service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  See id.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the attorney or agent represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the attorney or agent will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

As an initial matter, the Board finds that the Appellant served as the Veteran's duly appointed representative beginning in March 2014, when the Veteran executed the March 2014 VA Form 21-22a appointing the Appellant as representative.  In addition, the Board finds that the parties properly executed the June 2015 Fee Agreement providing that the Appellant would be entitled to the direct payment of fees in the amount of 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded by VA.  As the record reflects that the March 2014 Appointment and June 2015 Fee Agreement comply with the applicable VA regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that both were valid for purposes of the award of fees at the time the Appellant submitted the March 2015 NOD and December 2017 Appeal on behalf of the Veteran.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.627, 14.631, 14.636. 

In addition, regarding the required contested claims procedures, the Board finds that such procedures have been completed, as in January 2024, the Veteran was provided a copy of the Appellant's redacted January 2024 NOD, and in March 2024, both the Veteran and the Appellant were provided additional notice that the January 2024 NOD was placed on the Board's direct review docket.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.403, 20.404.

Regarding the initial decision with respect to the claim at issue, the Board finds that the March 2015 Rating Decision constitutes the initial decision for the following reasons: (1) in March 2014, the parties executed the March 2014 VA Form 21-22a appointing the Appellant as the Veteran's representative; (2) in June 2015, the parties executed the June 2015 Fee Agreement; (3) the March 2015 Rating Decision denied the Veteran's service connection claim for the right knee disability; (4) in response, the Appellant submitted the March 2015 NOD on behalf of the Veteran seeking review of the March 2015 Rating Decision; (5) the AOJ issued the November 2017 SOC again denying the Veteran's service connection claim for the right knee disability; (6) in response, the Appellant filed the December 2017 Appeal on behalf of the Veteran seeking review of the November 2017 SOC; and (7) thereafter, following a Board remand, the September 2023 Rating Decision granted service connection for the Veteran's right knee disability and assigned the following disability ratings: (a) a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5003-5260, effective March 31, 2014; and (b) a noncompensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5261, effective May 5, 2023.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1) (2018); Held, 37 Vet. App. at 32-33.

Regarding the nature of the services provided by the Appellant, as noted above, the Appellant filed the March 2015 NOD on behalf of the Veteran seeking review of the March 2015 Rating Decision and the December 2017 Appeal on behalf of the Veteran seeking review of the November 2017 SOC.  Thereafter, in the September 2023 Rating Decision stemming from that appeal, the AOJ awarded the following: (1) service connection for the Veteran's right knee osteoarthritis and painful motion with a 10 percent rating, effective March 31, 2014; and (b) service connection for the Veteran's right knee limitation of extension with a noncompensable rating, effective, effective May 5, 2023.

Despite these findings, in the December 2023 Fee Decision, the AOJ advised the parties as follows: (1) the amount of past-due benefits, which is computed from the effective date of the award through the date of the September 2023 Rating Decision, was $2,225.20, and the amount withheld for agent fees was $445.04, which represents 20 percent of the Veteran's past-due benefits; and (2) the Veteran owed a pre-existing "debt to the United States Government in the amount of $2,915.56," which exceeded the amount of the past-due benefits awarded by the September 2023 Rating Decision; therefore, "this case is not eligible for the direct payment of fees" to the Appellant.

However, for the following reasons, the Board disagrees and finds that the Appellant is eligible for the direct payment of fees in the amount of 20 percent of the past-due benefits paid to the Veteran pursuant to the September 2023 Rating Decision.

First, the record reflects that the Appellant has complied with the power of attorney requirements, and that the June 2015 Fee Agreement is valid.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.627, 14.631, 14.636.  

Second, the March 2015 Rating Decision denied the Veteran's service connection claim for a right knee disability; therefore, the Board finds that the March 2015 Rating Decision constitutes the initial decision on the matter of this claim, and the AOJ issued notice of that decision prior to February 19, 2019, the effective date of the modernized review system.

Third, the Appellant filed both the March 2015 NOD and the December 2017 Appeal seeking review of the March 2015 Rating Decision after June 20, 2007.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1) (2015).  Subsequently, the AOJ issued the September 2023 Rating Decision granting the Veteran's right knee disability claim, as described above.    

Finally, as noted above, attorney or agent fees are calculated based on the total amount of past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran regardless of the amount actually paid to the Veteran, as the term "past-due benefits" includes the total amount of benefits that were unpaid or owed to the Veteran "when VA completes the 'non-mechanical judgments' of assigning a disability rating and an effective date."  Rosinski, 32 Vet. App. at 269, citing Jackson v. McDonald, 635 Fed. Appx. 858, 861 (Fed. Cir. 2015); see also Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Moreover, "nothing in the language of Section 5904 requires that ... money actually be paid" to the Veteran.  Id., citing Jackson, 635 Fed Appx. at 861.  In short, VA's obligations to attorneys and agents under Section 5904 are to be determined by the amount awarded, not by the amount the Veteran is actually entitled to receive.  See id. at 276; see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 33, 38 (2019) (explaining that "the amount of 'benefits awarded on the basis of the claim' is determined by VA when the claim is granted and is not affected by an impediment to payment"). 

Accordingly, in light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the requisite criteria have been met for eligibility for direct payment of fees to the Appellant in connection with the September 2023 Rating Decision, and the claim is granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904.
