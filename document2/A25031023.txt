ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) from September 11, 2017, is granted.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. s 1114(s) from August 25, 2020, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's chronic fatigue syndrome prevented the Veteran from securing and following a substantially gainful occupation beginning September 11, 2017. 

2. The evidence of record indicates that the Veteran satisfied the criteria for special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. s 1114(s) beginning August 25, 2020.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) from September 11, 2017, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

2. The criteria for special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. s 1114(s) from August 25, 2020, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350(i), 4.16(a), 4.25.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1990 to May 1991. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2021 rating decision issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In a June 2024 decision, the Board granted a TDIU from October 11, 2018, to November 2, 2023, and dismissed entitlement to a TDIU from November 2, 2023. 

The Veteran appealed the June 2024 Board decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). The Court granted a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) dismissing the appeal with respect to the issue of entitlement to a TDIU from November 2, 2023, and remanded for the Board to consider whether the Veteran is entitled to SMC prior to November 2, 2023, and a TDIU prior to October 11, 2018. 

These issues have now returned to the Board for adjudication.

1. Entitlement to a TDIU from September 11, 2017.

Legal Criteria

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id.

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3)disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018) (combining disabilities as "one disability" to meet the rating threshold of § 4.16(a) requires the use of the combined rating table).

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. Id. Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Id.

Analysis

For the period from September 11, 2017, to October 11, 2018, the Veteran had the following service-connected disabilities: (1) chronic fatigue syndrome rated at 60 percent disabling effective February 2, 2017; and (2) other specified anxiety disorder (anxiety) rated at 30 percent disabling effective February 2, 2017, and 50 percent disabling effective October 11, 2018. 

Based on the foregoing, the Veteran had one disability rated at 60 percent or more. Thus, the Board may consider the TDIU claim on a schedular basis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to a TDIU beginning September 11, 2017, when it was reasonably raised by the record. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009). 

On September 11, 2017, the Veteran was provided a VA examination for his chronic fatigue syndrome. The examiner noted symptoms of debilitating fatigue, generalized muscle aches or weakness, fatigue lasting 24 hours or longer after exercise, headaches, migratory joint pains, and sleep disturbance. Regarding cognitive impairment attributable to chronic fatigue syndrome, the examiner noted an inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, and confusion. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's difficulty focusing and remembering and episodes of being extremely fatigued prevent him from working. 

On October 3, 2017, the Veteran was provided a VA examination regarding his anxiety disorder. The examiner noted occupational and social impairment due to mild to transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or; symptoms controlled by medication. The examiner noted symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks occurring weekly or less often, and chronic sleep impairment. 

In March 2021, the Veteran submitted a private vocational assessment. The provider noted that the Veteran's last employment was between December 2017 and early 2018 as a prep cook, working three to four times a week, up to five hours a day, for his son who was a kitchen manager. The Veteran's last full-time job was working as a wood cutter for a cabinet shop. "He stopped this work [at] the end of 2017 because he could not physically or mentally perform the job anymore due to his service connected mental health and chronic fatigue syndrome. He has not worked performing any substantially gainful work since the end of 2017. He has only done the work helping his son out." 

The provider noted that the Veteran's chronic fatigue syndrome causes difficulty focusing and remembering and episodes of extreme fatigue, preventing working. The Veteran has daily headaches with flare ups, which occur approximately two times per week, lasting two to three hours, with blurry vision, nausea, sensitivity to light, changes in vision, and prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine and non-migraine pain that produces severe economic inadaptability. The provider stated that the Veteran has been fired from jobs due to his headaches preventing him from working. After an analysis of the Veteran's employment and medical history, the provider concluded that the Veteran has been unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment since at least December 31, 2017. See March 2021 private vocational assessment. 

The Board finds that the Veteran has been unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment due to his chronic fatigue syndrome since September 11, 2017. 

While the October 2017 mental health VA examination did not indicate total occupational impairment, both the September 2017 chronic fatigue syndrome VA examination and the March 2021 private vocational assessment indicate that the Veteran's chronic fatigue syndrome preclude employment. 

The Board also acknowledges that while the Veteran did work part time as a prep cook for his son, such employment was in a protected environment such as a family business and constitutes marginal employment. 

The ability to work sporadically or obtain marginal employment is not substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991). Marginal employment, i.e., earned annual income that does not exceed the poverty threshold for one person, is not considered substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Thus, a TDIU may still be awarded in such instances where a veteran's employment is deemed to be "marginal employment," because he cannot engage in more lucrative "substantially gainful employment." Where reasonably raised by the facts of a particular case, the Board must consider and expressly state whether the Veteran would be able to obtain or maintain a substantially gainful occupation or, whether the Veteran is capable of more than "marginal employment." See Ortiz-Valles v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 65, 71 (2016).

Employment in a protected environment "means a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024). Employment in a protected environment still constitutes marginal employment even though earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold. Id. The Board may consider any individualized factor or evidence that tends to clarify whether a specific position was shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market. Id. at 124. Yet the Court in LaBruzza emphasized that employment need not be completely shielded or separated from the employment market to qualify as being in a protected environment and thus marginal employment. Id. at 122. The Court in LaBruzza also cautioned that employment is not "in a protected environment" simply because a veteran receives workplace accommodations for service-connected disabilities or remains employed despite being occupationally impaired. Id. at 125 (citing Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993)). Significantly, the Court in LaBruzza added, "of course, the income that a veteran earns from employment must be relatively low to qualify as 'in a protected environment.'" Id. at 124. Regardless, the Court in LaBruzza would not set a bright-line rule for what constitutes a "lower-income" position. Id. at 123.

Here, the Veteran working in a part-time position as a prep cook for his son, a kitchen manager, constitutes a protected environment such as a family business. In support of the Veteran's inability to be competitive in the employment market, record indicates that the Veteran stopped working his full-time job near the end of 2017 due to the symptoms of his service-connected disabilities.

For the reasons stated above, a TDIU from September 11, 2017 (one year prior to the receipt of his claim), is granted.

2. Entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. s 1114(s) from August 25, 2020.

Special monthly compensation, or SMC, is available when, as the result of service-connected disability, a veteran suffers additional hardships above and beyond those contemplated by VA's schedule for rating disabilities. See generally, 38 U.S.C. § 1114; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.352; see also VAOPGCPREC 5-89 (Mar. 23, 1989) (explaining that SMC is a supplementary statutory benefit based on noneconomic factors such as personal inconvenience, social inadaptability, or the profound nature of a disability). The rate of SMC varies according to the nature of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities.

Basic levels of SMC are listed at 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k). Higher levels of SMC are provided at 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l)-(t). SMC is payable in addition to the basic rate of compensation otherwise payable for the degree of disability. 

Here, the Veteran seeks an additional award of SMC at the "S" level prior to November 2, 2023, on account of being housebound. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). SMC benefits by reason of being housebound are payable under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) if the Veteran has a single disability rated as 100 percent disabling (as total) and has either: (1) additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) is "permanently housebound" by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. Id. 

The disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more must be separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i)(1).

In the alternative to the 60 percent or more rating, the "permanently housebound" requirement is met if a veteran is substantially confined as a direct result of service-connected disabilities to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or if institutionalized to the ward or clinical areas and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime. 38 C F R § 3.351(i)(2). The disability or disabilities that make the Veteran "permanently housebound" need not be separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability. However, the Court has held that leaving one's house for medical purposes cannot, by itself, serve as the basis for finding that one is not substantially confined for purposes of SMC housebound benefits. Howell v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 535, 540 (2006). In other words, one can leave the home for medical purposes and still be considered "permanently housebound" under VA law.

Turning now to the requirement for a single disability rating at 100 percent, the Federal Circuit has held housebound benefits are not available to a veteran whose total 100 percent disability rating is based on multiple disabilities, none of which is individually rated at 100 percent disabling. Guerra v. Shinseki, 642 F.3d 1046 (Fed. Cir. 2011); VAOPGCPREC 66-91 (Aug. 15, 1991).

However, for the purpose of meeting this criterion, a rating of 100 percent may be based on any of the following grants of total disability: on a schedular basis, on an extra-schedular basis, or on the basis of a temporary total rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.28  (pre-stabilization rating), 4.29 (temporary total hospital rating) or, 4.30 (temporary total convalescence rating). See VAOPGCPREC 2-94 (February 2, 1994).

In Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008), the Court subsequently confirmed that a grant of TDIU based on a single disability constitutes a "service-connected disability rated as total" for purposes of meeting housebound benefits under section 1114(s). In other words, a TDIU rating based on a single disability, but not multiple disabilities, is permitted to satisfy the statutory requirement of a total rating. Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 293. The Court explained there could be a situation where a Veteran has a 100 percent schedular total rating for a particular service-connected disability and could establish a TDIU rating for another service-connected disability in order to qualify for SMC housebound benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) by having an "additional" disability of 60 percent or more ("housebound" rate). Id. at 292-94. Nonetheless, the TDIU rating based on a single disability that satisfies the total (100 percent) rating requirement must be separate and distinct from the additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more for purposes of housebound benefits. Id. at 293.

Here, the Veteran has a TDIU based on his chronic fatigue syndrome. The Veteran is also service connected for anxiety, which was rated at 30 percent disabling, effective February 2, 2017; 50 percent disabling, effective October 11, 2018; and 70 percent disabling, effective August 25, 2020. As the Veteran's anxiety disorder became independently ratable at 70 percent effective August 25, 2020, the criteria for SMC at the "S" rate became satisfied. 

Accordingly, SMC benefits by reason of being housebound from August 25, 2020, are granted. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).
