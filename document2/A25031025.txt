An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. 

In the present case, the appellant's authorized representative has withdrawn this appeal and there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, having been properly withdrawn, the appeal is dismissed.
