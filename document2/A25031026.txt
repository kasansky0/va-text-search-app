ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that sleep apnea is?secondary to a service-connected psychiatric disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, secondary to service-connected disability, have been met.  38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 5107(b);?38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303(a), 3.304, 3.306, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from September 1968 to August 1972.

This appeal comes before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the August 2020 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)?Veterans Benefits Administration Regional Office (RO) which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  The August 2020 rating decision confirmed and continued a previous denial of service connection for sleep apnea.  In September 2020, VA received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), which requested a hearing docket review of the appeal by the Board.  ? 

In September 2024, the Veteran?attended?a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge.  A transcript of that hearing is of record.???? 

Under the?hearing?review election, the Board may consider?evidence submitted to VA at the time of the August 2020 rating decision,?any evidence submitted at the September 2024 Board hearing,?and any evidence submitted within 90?days after the scheduled hearing.? VA will not seek additional evidence on behalf of the Veteran as part of the review.? 38?C.F.R. §?20.303

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.900; 38 U.S.C. § 7107.

During the course of this appeal,?an August 2024 rating decision established service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, effective February 14, 2024, based on a February 2024 claim filing.? However, the current claim before the Board remains pending because it is based on an earlier claim filing in June 2019, and could result in an earlier effective date for service connection.

1. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

Service connection may be established for disability caused by disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.303, 3.304.  In order to establish service connection for a claimed disability, there must be (1)?medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence, generally medical, of a causal relationship between the claimed in service disease or injury and the current disability.  Hickson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?247 (1999). 

Service connection may also be established for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in-service.  38?U.S.C. §?1113(b); 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d); Cosman v. Principi, 3?Vet. App.?503 (1992).  The disease entity for which service connection is sought must be chronic rather than acute and transitory in nature.  For the showing of chronic disease in service, a combination of manifestations must exist sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word chronic. 

Secondary?service connection may be established for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disability.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.310. 

Competent lay evidence means any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience.  Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of the facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person.  38?C.F.R. §?3.159(a)(2).  Lay testimony is competent when it regards the readily observable features or symptoms of injury or illness and may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Veteran is competent to provide testimony concerning factual matters of which she has firsthand knowledge, such as experiencing a physical symptom such as pain.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303 (2007); Washington v. Nicholson, 19?Vet. App.?362 (2005).  Therefore, the Board must assess the competence and credibility of lay statements.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303 (2007). 

Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while weight and credibility are factual determinations going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  Rucker v. Brown, 10?Vet. App.?67 (1997). 

A Veteran need only demonstrate that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence to prevail.  To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must be against the claim.  Alemany v. Brown, 9?Vet. App.?518 (1996). 

While the Board must provide reasons and bases supporting a decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the evidence submitted by or on behalf of the Veteran. Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence).  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence of record.  The Veteran should not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed.  Timberlake v. Gober, 14?Vet. App.?122 (2000). 

As an initial matter, the Board notes that, during the course of this appeal,?an August 2024 rating decision established service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, effective February 14, 2024.  That grant of service connection stems from a February 14, 2024, intent to file a claim for compensation and the subsequent April 25, 2024, VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim application. 

The current claim pending before the Board stems from a June 20, 2019, intent to file a claim for compensation; a July 15, 2019, VA Form 21-526EZ application for disability compensation, and the subsequent appeal.  The question currently before the Board is whether or not the Veteran met the criteria for service connection for sleep apnea at the time of the August 27, 2020, rating decision on appeal. 

The Veteran is seeking service connection for sleep apnea. The Veteran contends that the sleep disability is caused or aggravated by service-connected disabilities. 

An August 2020 rating decision found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of sleep apnea and was service-connected for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  The Board is bound by those favorable findings. 

In a private February 2020 opinion, a physician provided a medical opinion that sleep apnea was most likely caused by or a result of service- connected PTSD.  In support of the opinion, the examiner provided three studies that supported the opinion that there was a direct connection between sleep apnea and PTSD. 

During an appropriate evidentiary window, the Veteran also submitted a private February 2024 letter from a nurse practitioner that stated that an opinion that the Veteran's sleep apnea was directly or indirectly related to PTSD, and reiterated the opinion of the February 2020 physician.

During an appropriate evidentiary window, the Veteran also re-submitted a May 2024 VA opinion.  The May 2024 VA examiner opined that the claimed condition was at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) proximately due to or the result of the service-connected disability.  The examiner explained that the current severity of the service- connected PTSD warranted by proximity, association of the sleep apnea.  The examiner opined that the claimed condition began subsequent to the service-connected disability and was the direct result of the service-connected disability. The examiner stated that the medical literature supports that opinion and a nexus was established.  The Veteran served in Vietnam.  Review of records showed evidence of sleep study and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in 1998. The Veteran was service-connected for PTSD.  The Veteran has no issues related to PTSD or sleep apnea prior to service.  Although records showed that Veteran's sleep apnea was diagnosed years before PTSD, the PTSD was incurred from events that occurred while on active duty.  The Veteran was wounded while in Vietnam and received a Purple Heart.  The Veteran informed the examiner that when he returned home from Vietnam, the environment was not one where he could talk about being a Veteran, or pursue treatment for related mental health symptoms.  The Veteran was self-medicating with alcohol, but after two failed marriages and talking to other Veterans, he decided to seek help for a mental health disability. Veterans with PTSD screen as high risk for sleep apnea at much higher rates than those seen in community studies and may not show all classic predictors of sleep apnea.  Studies indicate that there may be an increased prevalence of sleep apnea in individuals with major depressive disorder and PTSD, despite considerable heterogeneity and a high risk of bias.

The Board assigns great probative value to the private February 2020 and May 2024 VA medical opinions because of the training, experience, and thoroughness of the examiners.  Among the factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims file and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.  Hayes v. Brown, 5?Vet. App.?60 (1993) (responsibility of the Board to assess the credibility and weight to be given the evidence); Wood v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App. 190 (1992).  The probative value of medical evidence is based on the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion he reaches.  As is true of any evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to medical opinions are within the province of the Board.  Guerrieri v. Brown, 4?Vet. App.?467 (1993). 

The private February 2020 and May 2024 VA medical opinions were made after examination and review of the record, were consistent with the evidence in the case, and provided adequate reasons and bases in support of the conclusion.  The examiners opined that the claimed sleep apnea was secondary to a service-connected psychiatric disability.  The examiners based their opinions on the Veteran's history and lay statements, and first-hand clinical experience, and cited to medical research.  The opinions of the private February 2020 and May 2024 VA examiners are highly probative because they are supported by rationale and provided by trained medical professionals.  The examiners specifically identified and discussed the Veteran's contentions and theory concerning service and the claimed disability.  Thus, the Board finds the medical opinions to be competent and credible.  The private February 2020 and May 2024 VA examinations support a finding that a current sleep apnea diagnosis is at least as likely as not related to a service-connected psychiatric disability. 

The Board acknowledges that there may be contradictory evidence of record. However, the Board cannot ignore the medical evidence finding that the Veteran's sleep disability was caused by a service-connected disability.  Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance regarding whether the Veteran has obstructive sleep apnea that is related to service or a service-connected disability. 

Accordingly, based on the foregoing, and resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that, based on the June 2019 claim filing and at the time of the August 2020 rating decision on appeal, the competent medical evidence supports a finding that sleep apnea is etiologically related to a service-connected psychiatric disability.  Therefore, service connection for sleep apnea is warranted, and service connection for sleep apnea, secondary to service-connected psychiatric disability, is granted.  38?U.S.C. §?5107.
