DOCKET NO. 231116-392794
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

An effective date of July 12, 2019, for bilateral hearing loss is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

An effective date of July 12, 2019, for tinnitus is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

FINDINGS OF FACT

The Veteran submitted a completed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim within 60 days of submitting his prior incorrect VA Form 21-526b Supplemental Claim, which in turn was submitted with new and relevant evidence within one year of the December 7, 2020 notification of the denial of the Veteran's July 12, 2019 claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an earlier effective date of July 12, 2019, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.159, 3.160(a).

2. The criteria for an earlier effective date of July 12, 2019, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.159, 3.160(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1967 July 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on February 6, 2025. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran, or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). Here, however, the Veteran waived the 90-day period to submit additional evidence at his Board hearing. 

An effective date of July 12, 2019 for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date before August 5, 2022 for the grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of service-connected compensation is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A complete claim is required for all types of claims and will generally be considered filed as of the date it was received by VA for an evaluation or award of benefits under the laws administered by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d). After February 19, 2019, upon receipt of a communication indicating a belief in entitlement to benefits that is submitted in writing or electronically on a supplemental claim form prescribed by VA that is not complete, VA shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete claim within 60 days of notice by VA that an incomplete claim was filed, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the incomplete claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(1)(i). For supplemental claims, a complete claim requires potentially new evidence that must be submitted or included. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160 (a)(6). 

Further, when a claim has been continuously pursued, such as in the present case, the date of application shall be considered the date of the filing of the initial application for a benefit. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a)(2).

In this case, the RO denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus in a September 2019 rating decision. The Veteran requested a higher-level review, and the RO continued the denial in a December 2020 rating decision. 

On December 3, 2021, within one year of the December 2020 rating decision, the Veteran submitted new and relevant evidence and a supplemental claim on VA Form VA 21-526b. After many months of no communication from VA, the Veteran's representative inquired as to the status of the claim on August 5, 2022. On August 9, 2020, the RO informed the Veteran that it received an intent to file on August 5, 2022. In a letter dated August 10, 2022, the RO informed the Veteran that an incorrect form was used for his previously submitted (on December 3, 2021) supplemental claim for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. The Veteran promptly submitted a supplemental claim on the proper form, VA Form 20-0995, two days later. The RO subsequently granted service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus in a December 15, 2022 rating decision, with an effective date of August 5, 2022, the date of his purported intent to file. 

In the absence of any valid regulation, the Board finds that 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(i) is most applicable, and most equitable course of action is to treat the Veteran's December 3, 2021 VA 21-526b Supplemental Claim as an "incomplete" supplemental claim. Since the correct form was submitted within 60 days of the notification of the incorrect form, and the Veteran submitted new and relevant evidence with his claim within one year of the December 4, 2020 rating decision, an effective date of July 12, 2019, and but not earlier, for the grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus is warranted, and to this extent the claim is granted.

An effective date prior to July 12, 2019 is not warranted, as there is no other correspondence that could be possibly constitute a service connection claim for bilateral hearing loss or tinnitus.
