ORDER

Basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill or Chapter 33) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record shows the Veteran has insufficient qualifying active duty service after September 10, 2001 to qualify for Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill have not been met. 10 U.S.C. § 2107(b); 38 U.S.C. §§ 3301, 3311; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.9505, 21.9520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 2019 to June 2022.

An August 2022 letter denied education benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. A June 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealed the decision and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33

An August 2022 letter denied education benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill due to insufficient qualifying active duty service after September 10, 2001.

The Veteran submitted argument that he should be entitled to Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits because he served at least 30 days qualifying active duty and was medically discharged.

Basic eligibility for Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits requires (a) a minimum of 90 aggregate days of active duty excluding active duty for entry level and skill training, or (b) a minimum of 30 continuous days of creditable active duty service and a discharge under other than dishonorable conditions due to a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520.

For the purposes of Chapter 33 education benefits, creditable active duty does not include any period of service required by an officer pursuant to an agreement under 10 U.S.C. § 2107(b), which includes scholarships for ROTC. 38 U.S.C. § 3311(d)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 21.9505(3)(i). Specifically, for appointment as an ROTC cadet entitled to receive financial assistance, the cadet must agree that, at the discretion of the Secretary of the military department concerned, they will accept an appointment, if offered, as a commissioned officer and if commissioned as a regular officer, they must serve on active duty for four or more years. 10 U.S.C. § 2107(b)(5)(A).

The record reflects the Veteran was enrolled in the Army ROTC program from August 2017 to December 2019. He was commissioned as an officer in December 2019, agreeing to an active duty commitment from February 2020 for four years. See Army Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) Scholarship Cadet Contract (DA Form 597-3); Enlistment/Reenlistment Document Armed Forces of the United States (DD Form 4/1); and November 2019 Order.

The Veteran's DD-214 shows active duty service from December 2019 to June 2022. It noted the Veteran was commissioned through ROTC scholarship. Character of service was listed as honorable. Narrative reason for separation was listed as disability, permanent.

Service medical and personnel records indicate the Veteran was released from duty because of physical disability incurred during active duty, effective June 14, 2022. See April 2022 Order. 

VA and Department of Defense (DOD) Identity Repository (VADIR) reports reflect the Veteran had obligated service from February 23, 2020 to February 23, 2024.

The Board finds the evidence of record weighs against sufficient qualifying active duty service after September 10, 2001 to qualify for Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits.

The Veteran's active duty service from December 2019 to June 2022 does not qualify for Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefit eligibility. As set forth by regulation, a period of service on active duty as an officer pursuant to an agreement under 10 U.S.C. § 2107(b) shall not be considered a part of the period of active duty on which an individual's entitlement to educational assistance under Chapter 33 is based. 38 U.S.C. § 3311 (d)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 21.9505 (3)(i). 

The Board considered the Veteran's contention that he is entitled to Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits due to meeting the criteria of serving a minimum of 30 continuous days of creditable active duty service with discharge due to a service-connected disability. The Board recognizes the Veteran was unable to finish his four year ROTC obligation due to no fault of his own as he was medically discharged from service. However, the legal criteria governing service eligibility requirements for Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance are clear and specific. Active duty under 10 U.S.C. § 2107(b) shall not be considered a part of the period of active duty on which an individual's entitlement to Chapter 33 educational assistance is based. Unfortunately, VA cannot extend benefits out of sympathy for a particular veteran who is otherwise statutorily ineligible to receive those benefits. Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416 (1994). Under the governing criteria, there is no basis in law upon which to grant the Veteran educational assistance benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

As the disposition of this matter is based on the law, and not the facts of the case, the appeal must be denied. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
