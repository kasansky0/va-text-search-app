ORDER

An effective date of August 29, 2014, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for major depressive disorder with PTSD is granted.

An effective date of August 29, 2014, but no earlier, for the award of a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

An effective date of August 29, 2014, but no earlier, for the award of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC chapter 35 is granted.

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 70 percent for major depressive disorder with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran originally filed a claim for PTSD on August 29, 2014 that was denied in a March 2015 decision. The decision that denied service connection for PTSD was not appealed. 

2. While the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim form that was received by VA on October 15, 2016, a completed application for compensation benefits was not filed within one year.  Following, the Veteran filed a claim for mental conditions, among other claimed disabilities, on November 14, 2017, which was later denied.

3. Following an appeal to the Board, the claims were remanded and relevant service records were associated with the claims file.

4. The Veteran now meets the schedular criteria for TDIU from August 29, 2014, but no earlier.

5. From August 29, 2014, a permanent and total disability rating is now in effect, thereby showing an award of basic eligibility to DEA benefits is warranted.

6. The Veteran has the maximum allowable schedular evaluation for tinnitus under the applicable rating criteria. 

7. Throughout the period on appeal, the evidence of record does not demonstrate that the Veteran's major depressive disorder with PTSD rose to the level of total occupational and social impairment. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of August 29, 2014 for the award of service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.165(c), 3.400. 

2. The criteria for an effective date of August 29, 2014 for the award of a TDIU were met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.16.

3. The criteria for an effective date of August 29, 2014 for basic eligibility to DEA benefits were met. 

4. The criteria for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected tinnitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260. 

5. The criteria for entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 70 percent for major depressive disorder with PTSD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1985 to August 1991.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeal (Board) on appeal from a June 2022 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The Board notes that during the pendency of the appeal, the RO continued its noncompensable evaluation for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss in an August 2022 decision.  In March 2023, the Veteran disagreed with the June 2022 decision by submitting a VA Form 10182 and electing direct review by a Veterans Law Judge under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system. In a December 2023 decision, the RO once again denied the Veteran's increased evaluation claim for bilateral hearing loss.

As the appellant has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of its decision on the issues on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.  The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the notice of disagreement, known under the AMA system as the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The appellant has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. The appellant is welcome to file a supplemental claim to have this evidence considered.  Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Earlier Effective Dates

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on a claim for compensation is to be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but not earlier than the date the claim was received. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a). The effective date of an award of service connection based on a reopened claim is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Where service connection is granted on the basis of a claim reopened after final disallowance, the effective date is the date of receipt of the application to reopen, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2), (r). The Court has held that when a claim is reopened, the effective date cannot be earlier than the date of the claim to reopen. Juarez v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 537, 539-540 (2008) (citing Bingham v. Nicholson, 421 F. 3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2005); Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d. 1333, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2005); Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332, 340 (1995)).

The Board notes that an application that has been previously denied cannot preserve an effective date for a later grant of benefits based on a new application. See Wright v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 343, 347 (1997) ("Nothing in the statute indicates that an effective date can be set based upon an application that resulted in a final disallowance of the claim."); see also Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 248 (2002) ("The statutory framework simply does not allow for the Board to reach back to the date of the original claim as a possible effective date for an award of service-connected benefits that is predicated upon a reopened claim."). For a claimant to be awarded an effective date based on an earlier claim, he must show clear and unmistakable error in the prior denial of the claim or another exception to finality. Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332, 340 (1995); see also Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299-00 (2006).

One such exception to finality is the receipt of new and material evidence prior to the finality of a rating decision (within one year), which requires readjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). Another exception to the general rule involves the receipt of previously unconsidered service records under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c).

Under the AMA, a claimant who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidenced is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that in order to be considered a valid claim, a claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form. 79 Fed. Reg. 57, 660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (eff. Mar. 24, 2015). As this amendment applies to claims or appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015, the amended regulations apply in this case. Id. at 57, 686. Following the March 2015 amendment, a claim for benefits must be filed on the standardized claim form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.150, 3.151. A veteran may also indicate their intent to file a claim for compensation by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA must provide the claimant with the appropriate claims form. Id.  If a complete application for benefits on the form prescribed by the Secretary is received by VA within one year of receipt of the intent to file, VA will consider the formal claim to have been filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. Id. An intent to file a claim must be submitted using one of three approved methods and must identify the general benefit and the claimant. Id.

PTSD

The Veteran and his representative have asserted that the effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD should be August 29, 2014, based on his initial filing and findings contained in a National Transportation Safety Board Aviation Accident Final Report.

In turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran originally filed a claim for PTSD on August 29, 2014 that was denied in a March 2015 decision. The Veteran was notified of the denial and his appellate rights that month but did not file a timely notice of disagreement (NOD) and new and material evidence was not received within one year of this decision.

On October 15, 2016, the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim form.  The form specifically stated that a completed application for compensation benefits must be submitted within a year of that filing to preserve the date.  However, the Veteran did not file a claim for PTSD during that one-year time period.  Indeed, he did not file another claim form until November 14, 2017 when he requested a claim be opened for mental conditions.  In January 2018, the RO denied service connection claim for mental health conditions, which was appealed in July 2018. After being certified to the Board, it reopened and remanded the service connection claim for mental health conditions after recharacterizing it as service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  In a December 2020 decision, the RO granted service connection for major depressive disorder claimed as PTSD with a 70 percent evaluation, effective November 14, 2017. Following a series of events, in a May 2022 decision, the RO continued its 70 evaluation of the claim. Following a higher-level review, the claim was denied again in a June 2022 decision, the current decision on appeal.

After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that an effective date of August 29, 2014, but no earlier, is warranted for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), if, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records, that existed but were not associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim. In such instance, the Veteran is not required to provide new and material evidence to reopen the claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).  Service department records include, but are not limited to, any official service department records "related" to a claimed in-service event, injury or disease, additional records forwarded by the Department of Defense or the service department to the VA at any time after VA's initial request, and declassified records that could not have been obtained at the time of the prior final denial. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1)(i)-(iii). Effective February 19, 2019, for appeals under the modernized Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), VA regulation 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1) provides that "[r]elevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim" and "includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed."

VA's obligation to reconsider a claim based upon receipt of new service department records pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1) is satisfied by readjudication of the claim on the merits, to include all evidence of record, and does not require that the decision cite to § 3.156(c)(1) or refer to the decision as a "reconsideration." Morse v. McDonough, 994 F.3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. April 19, 2021).  This regulation does not apply to records that VA could not have obtained when it decided the claim because they did not exist or because the claimant failed to provide sufficient information for VA to identify and obtain the records. An award made based all or in part on such records is effective on the date entitlement arose or the date which VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later, or such other date as may be authorized by the provisions of this part applicable to the previously denied claim.

To qualify for an earlier effective date under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3), the award of benefits need not be based "solely" on the new service department records but must be based "at least in part" on service department records that were not before the VA at the time of the initial denial of the claim. Flores-Vazquez v. McDonough, 996 F.3d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The Court has said of the operation of § 3.156(c), "the original claim is not just re-opened, it is reconsidered and serves as the date of the claim and the earliest date for which benefits maybe granted." Vigil v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 63, 66-67 (2008).

In this case, the RO obtained some service records prior to the issuance of its March 2015 decision.  However, following the Board remand in January 2020, the RO requested and obtained additional service records.  Upon review, the Board finds the military personnel records obtained in October 2020 are relevant service department records that existed at the time of the March 2015 decision.  Specifically, the military personnel records are relevant to address the Veteran's mental well-being following the asserted stressor that has since been verified.  When evaluated, the records suggest a decline in the Veteran's performance following the incident. VA regulations albeit those applicable to PTSD claims have long held that evidence of in-service behavioral changes, including deterioration of work performance, is relevant in assessing an in-service psychiatric diagnosis or onset. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f)(5) (holding that a PTSD claim based upon in-service personal assault should consider evidence including behavioral changes during service).  In the present case, the personnel records speak to the previously denied point raised by the RO when it partially denied the claim as it found there was no evidence of an event, disease, or injury related to the Veteran's military service. Significantly, these service records were not previously part of the claims file at the time of the March 20215 decision and, therefore, fall under the category of newly submitted, relevant official service department records referred to in 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(i). As such, the Board finds that the March 2015 rating decision did not become final pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). Accordingly, an earlier effective date is warranted under 38 C.F.R.§ 3.156(c).

The Board notes the Veteran's representative asserted that a National Transportation Safety Board Aviation Accident Final Report should be considered a service record; however, it does not fall under the definition of such.  It is not an "official service department record" "related" to a claimed in-service event, injury or disease, an additional record forwarded by the Department of Defense or the service department to the VA at any time after VA's initial request, or a declassified record that could not have been obtained at the time of the prior final denial. Additionally, it is noted the Veteran submitted a stressor at the time of his filing that contained sufficient information for a search to be conducted.  However, the RO failed to do so. If a proper search had been initiated at that time, the Veteran's claimed stressor would have been corroborated and verified and service connection granted at that time.

After a review of the above, the Board finds the service department records concerning the Veteran's performance following the plane crash would likely have led to a grant of benefits. In this regard, the evidence is at least in equipoise regarding whether service connection for PTSD was warranted from the date of the Veteran's initial claim in August 2014.

The Veteran submitted his initial claim for entitlement to service connection on August 29, 2014, which is well more than one year after his separation from service. Therefore, after resolving in the Veteran's favor, and in full consideration of all of the above, the Board finds that the appropriate effective date is August 29, 2014, the date the initial claim for entitlement to service connection was received by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  Accordingly, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of August 29, 2014, but no earlier, is granted for the grant of service connection for PTSD.

TDIU

The issue with respect to TDIU is whether a claimant's service-connected disabilities preclude him from engaging in substantially gainful employment (i.e., work that is more than marginal, that permits the individual to earn a "living wage"). 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991). Unlike the regular disability rating schedule, which is based on the average work-related impairment caused by a disability, "entitlement to a TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstances." Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009). The fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough. The ultimate question is whether the claimant can perform the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993). In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration may be given to the claimant's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to age or to any impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

A TDIU may be assigned by the Board in the first instance where the schedular rating is less than total if it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of (1) a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" has been interpreted to consist of two components: one economic and one noneconomic. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 7274 (2019).

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran was granted TDIU based upon a grant of service connection for major depressive disorder with PTSD.  The RO granted a 70 percent evaluation effective November 14, 2017. Prior to that grant, the Veteran was service connection for tinnitus (10 percent disabling) and bilateral hearing loss (noncompensable).  Therefore, his combined evaluation on November 14, 2017 was 70 percent and only 10 percent prior to that date.  

However, as noted above, the effective date for the Veteran's PTSD should have been and is now August 29, 2014.  Thus, he met the schedular criteria for TDIU on August 29, 2014.  A review of the record does not show that the Veteran has been rendered unemployable due to his tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss.  Therefore, entitlement to TDIU would not arise until August 29, 2014, the date he was granted service connection for major depressive disorder with PTSD. Thus, an effective date of August 29, 2014 is granted for entitlement to TDIU.

DEA

As indicated above from August 29, 2014, the Veteran has been awarded TDIU based solely upon his service-connected PTSD. In this case, the current effective date for basic eligibility to DEA benefits is August 29, 2014, the same date as the award of a TDIU.  As discussed above, the Board finds the Veteran was entitled to an earlier effective date for a TDIU. DEA benefits may not be awarded prior to the effective date of an award of a permanent and total disability rating. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807. Therefore, the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of August 29, 2014 for entitlement to basic eligibility to DEA benefits. See id.; see also 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510.  

Disability Evaluations

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of, or incident to, military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995). Where an increase in the level of a service-connected disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges that a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509 10 (2007).

Tinnitus

The Veteran seeks an initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for his bilateral tinnitus. Under Diagnostic Code 6260, the maximum schedular rating available for tinnitus is 10 percent. In Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that 38 C.F.R. § 4.25(b) and 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260, limits a Veteran to a single disability rating for tinnitus, regardless of whether the tinnitus is unilateral or bilateral.

The Veteran's service-connected tinnitus has been assigned the maximum schedular rating available for tinnitus of 10 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260.  As there is no legal basis upon which to award separate schedular evaluations for tinnitus in each ear, the Veteran's appeal must be denied. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

In addition, the Veteran's record does not show any reports of any exceptional symptomatology that is not already considered by the schedular rating criteria for tinnitus, and therefore, extraschedular consideration is not warranted.  Accordingly, a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral tinnitus is denied.

PTSD

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. Ratings are assigned according to the manifestation of symptoms, but the use of the term "such as" in the General Rating Formula demonstrates that the symptoms after the phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a rating. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002). The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Veteran's major depressive disorder with PTSD is currently rating at 70 percent disabling pursuant to Diagnostic Code 9411. Under Diagnostic Code 9411, a 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.

In considering the evidence of record, the Board finds the Veteran's PTSD does not warrant a 100 percent evaluation.  Initially, the Board notes the claims file shows that, while the Veteran has been diagnosed with several psychiatric conditions, a private physician noted that he has not and is not currently treated for the conditions.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2020. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder.  She noted the Veteran's symptoms were recurrent thoughts, avoidance persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs, irritability, sleep impairment, depressed mood, anxiety, mild memory loss, impaired judgment, disturbance in mood and motivation, difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships and adapting to stressful circumstances, and impaired impulse control that resulted in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  During the appointment, he was observed to be casually dressed with good hygiene and grooming.  Additionally, the Veteran was awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, time, situation. He demonstrated adequate memory, unremarkable speech and content of thoughts along with logical and goal directed thought processes. The examiner stated his impulse control was intact, and he denied having active and current hallucinations, delusions, illusions, command perceptual disturbances and suicidal ideations. The Veteran reported being married for 24 years and having two children.  He also reported helping to raise his stepson.  He described having a generally positive relationship with his family, but noted having "ups and downs."

During a July 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported experiencing recurrent thoughts, avoidance persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs, irritability, sleep impairment, depressed mood, anxiety, mild memory loss, impaired judgment, disturbance in mood and motivation, difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships and adapting to stressful circumstances, suicidal ideations, and impaired impulse control.  The examiner found the symptoms resulted in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  The Veteran demonstrated normal orientation, communication, and speech.  He was observed to have appropriate hygiene and appearance. The examiner noted the Veteran had no present or past panic attacks, delusions, hallucinations, or obsessions. Moreover, he demonstrated appropriate thought processes and a mild degree of memory impairment related to names, directions, and recent events.  In reference to the Veteran's suicidal ideations, the examiner described them as occasional passive suicidal ideations in which the Veteran had no plan or intent.

Upon review of the above evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD does not more nearly approximate the 100 percent level.  In reviewing the Veteran's social impairment, he reported that he has a good relationship with his wife and children.  See July 2021 VA examination. During the December 2020 VA examination, the Veteran indicated that he had a positive relationship with his family members but had ups and downs.  While it is obvious the Veteran has a level of social impairment related to his service-connected PTSD, there is no evidence to show that he has total social impairment as he is still able to maintain positive and meaningful relationships. 

In turning to occupational impairment, the Veteran reported during the July 2021 VA examination that he had not worked since 2010 due to his physical conditions. In the December 2020 VA examination, he stated that when he was employed, he had difficulties adapting to interpersonal relationships and stressful situations as he became verbally aggressive and physical destructive.  While the Board the recognizes and sympathizes with the level of occupational impairment the Veteran experiences, the evidence of record has not shown that it rises to the level of total occupational impairment as contemplated by the 100 percent criteria. Indeed, records reveal that he is also unemployed due to his physical limitations rather than completely due to his PTSD symptoms. However, the Board recognizes that in a May 5, 2021 decision, the RO rendered him totally unemployable based on his service-connected major depressive disorder with PTSD.

The Board emphasizes that a 100 percent disability evaluation requires both total social and occupational impairment and finds that the Veteran's symptoms do not rise to that level during the period on appeal. See Melson v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 334 (1991) (use of the conjunctive "and" in a statutory provision meant that all of the conditions listed in the provision must be met).  Moreover, the Board notes the Veteran experiences suicidal ideations.  As noted above, the July 2021 examiner described the frequency as "occasional."  Therefore, this symptom does not rise to the level of being a persistent danger to himself as described in the 100 percent criteria.  After review, it is clear the record simply does not demonstrate a level of impairment consistent with the 100 percent criteria, nor have the Veteran's symptoms caused total occupational and social impairment referenced by the 100 percent evaluation criteria. Therefore, the Board finds that an increased evaluation is not warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Upon review of the claims file, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error has occurred that requires remand of the increased evaluation claim for bilateral hearing loss.

The Board notes that the Veteran was provided a VA audiological examination in June 2021.  However, the examiner stated the Veteran's hearing levels and speech discrimination could not be tested.  Specifically, it was noted that the results yielded poor inter-test reliability as the Veteran had to be prompted to respond during testing.  Additionally, his responses to behavioral audiometry testing were unreliable and invalid.  As the AOJ has not sought another examination to provide an assessment with valid test results, such was a pre-decisional duty to assist error and a remand is necessary to correct it. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a service connection claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide one that is adequate for purposes of the determination being made).

The Board reminds the Veteran that the duty to assist is not always a one-way street, and that failure to cooperate during a VA examination may result in an adverse decision being made in his claim. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991); Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 181 (2005). Thus, the Veteran must fully cooperate with the VA audiological examination in order to ensure reliable test results, or risk an adverse decision being made in the current appeal.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

The AOJ should schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to ascertain the current severity and manifestations of his service-connected bilateral hearing loss. Any and all studies, tests, and evaluations deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed and should include the Maryland CNC test and a pure tone audiometry test.

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file.

The examiner should also discuss the effect of the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss on his occupational functioning and daily activities.

A clear rationale for all opinions would be helpful and a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved would be of considerable assistance to the Board.
