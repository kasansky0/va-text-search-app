FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for depressive disorder was received by VA on January 28, 2013. 

2. Throughout the appeal period, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's depressive disorder symptoms have not more closely approximated total occupational and social impairment. 

3. The Veteran is in receipt of a 10 percent rating for her tinnitus, the maximum schedular rating provided by regulation, manifesting with symptoms contemplated by the rating criteria. 

4. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, from May 1, 2014, her service-connected disabilities rendered her unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation. 

5. The Veteran is entitled to basic eligibility to DEA as of the effective date of her TDIU rating.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1979 to November 1983.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals on appeal from a November 2022 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The Veteran selected the direct review docket in her November 2023 notice of disagreement (NOD) to the Board; however, as the Veteran requested higher-level review in November 2022 of an earlier November 3, 2022, rating decision, evidence up until the date of the November 3, 2022, rating decision will be considered.  

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 28, 2013, for the grant of service connection for depressive disorder.

Generally, the effective date for an award of service connection and disability compensation is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, for an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final allowance, or a claim for an increase, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

For VA compensation purposes, a "claim" is defined as "a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary."  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any matter material to the resolution of a claim, all reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107. 

In this case, the Veteran asserts that she should be entitled to an effective date prior to January 28, 2013, for the grant of service connection for her depressive disorder, which has been granted a 70 percent rating since January 28, 2013.  The Veteran was granted a January 28, 2013, effective date for service connection of depressive disorder and the 70 percent rating based on the original date of claim.  

The Board finds that the Veteran did not file a claim for service connection until January 28, 2013.  As the Veteran filed her claim more than a year after her discharge from service, the effective date is the date of the receipt of the Veteran's claim by VA, which is January 28, 2013.  

The Board further finds that the Veteran's file shows that she did not file any service connection claims until January 28, 2013.  In addition, the Veteran did not file an intent to file a claim form within the one year prior to January 28, 2013, claim form.  As such, there are no grounds to warrant an effective date prior to that assigned.  

Applying the pertinent VA regulation to the facts, an effective date earlier than January 28, 2013, is not warranted for the grant of service connection and the 70 percent rating for depressive disorder.  As the weight of the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not warranted, and the claim must be denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for unspecified depressive disorder.

Disability ratings are assigned in accordance with VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes (DCs) identify the various disabilities.  See generally 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  

In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  Consistent with the facts found, the rating may be higher or lower for segments of the time under review on appeal, which is known as "staged" ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  

In regards to psychiatric disorders, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 is "symptom-driven," meaning that "symptomatology should be the fact-finder's primary focus when deciding entitlement to a given disability rating."  Vasquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 116-17 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  The symptoms listed are not exhaustive, but rather, "serve as examples of the type and degree of symptom, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating."  Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002).  In the context of determining whether a higher disability evaluation is warranted, the analysis requires considering "not only the presence of certain symptoms but also that those symptoms have caused occupational and social impairment in most of the referenced areas;" that is, "the regulation . . . requires an ultimate factual conclusion as to the Veteran's level of impairment in 'most areas.'"  Vasquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 117-18.

Further, when evaluating a mental disorder, the Board must consider the "frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission."  38 C.F.R. § 4.126(a).  The Board must also "assign an evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of examination."  Id. 

Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for a mental disorder in January 2013 and has been granted a 70 percent rating, effective January 28, 2013, based on the date of claim.  The Veteran asserts that she is entitled to a higher rating.  

The Veteran's depressive disorder is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9435.  Under this code, a 70 percent evaluation is warranted where there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  Id.

A 100 percent evaluation requires total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and, memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  Id.

In this case, within the appeal period, the Veteran has had four VA examinations, as well as a private examination submitted in October 2018.  The April 2013 VA examiner noted reported symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, and chronic sleep impairment.  The symptoms were noted as having a mild impact on mood and sleep.  The Veteran stated that she was working at the Social Security Administration (SSA) fulltime as a stenographer and clerk and denied any work-related problems or issues with work performance.  The Veteran was noted as not participating in any therapy but was prescribed medications.  The Veteran was observed as being alert, cooperative, had good grooming and hygiene.  She denied suicidal ideation.  The Veterans occupational and social impairment was characterized as mild or transient symptoms which decreases work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress.  

A September 2018 private mental health assessment noted symptoms such as depressed mood, irritability, hypervigilance, sleep impairment, nightmares, fatigue, social withdrawal/isolation, diminished concentration, and anxiety.  The assessment further noted the Veteran stopped working at the SSA due to her symptoms and fears of leaving her home.  She further stated that during her bouts of depression she avoids showering, brushing her teeth and changing clothes for days.  The examiner characterized her occupational and social impairment as having deficiencies in most areas, such as work, family relations, judgment, thinking and mood "since at least January 2013" and that the Veteran has been unable to successfully secure and follow substantially gainful employment since 2014, when she stopped working at the SSA.  

A December 2019 VA mental disorders examination noted symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, and disturbances of mood and motivation.  The examination further noted the Veteran stopped working at the SSA in May 2014.  The Veteran had been married for 32 years and had two daughters who lived at home.  She occasionally attended church and spent most of her time with her family.  She maintained contact with her siblings and cousins.  The examiner characterized the Veteran's occupational and social impairment as having occasional decrease in work efficiency, intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation.  

A September 2021 VA mental disorders examination found symptoms consistent with those above, such as trouble sleeping, restlessness, depressed mood, low appetite, energy and motivation, and social isolation.  The examiner observed the Veteran was appropriately dressed, no difficulties with speech, concentration, orientation, no hallucinations or delusions, no suicidal or homicidal ideation, and thought processes were logical and coherent.  The examiner characterized the Veteran's occupational and social impairment as having occasional decrease in work efficiency, intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation.  

A September 2022 VA mental disorders examination indicated symptoms consistent with those noted above, such as depressed mood, problems with concentration, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation, and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  The examiner observed that the Veteran's affect was somber, she displayed adequate insight and judgment, no impairment in orientation as to time and place, no psychosis, or suicidal/homicidal ideation.  The Veteran continued to reside with her husband of 35 years and her youngest daughter.  She indicated she did not have friends in her community.  She had stopped attending church due to the pandemic.  The Veteran's occupational and social impairment was characterized as having reduced reliability and productivity.  

The Board finds that the VA examinations above do not indicate the Veteran's condition results in total occupational and social impairment that would warrant a 100 rating, such as gross impairment of thought processes, grossly inappropriate behavior, disorientation as to time and place, and inability to maintain minimal personal hygiene.  On the contrary, the Veteran was noted as being alert and oriented/in contact with reality/place/time, her mood was cooperative, eye contact, speech, grooming and hygiene were within normal limits, her thought process was coherent and logical, no psychotic symptoms were observed, as well as no disorganized speech or suicidal/homicidal ideation.  

Moreover, there is no evidence that the examiner was not competent or credible, as the examination reports were based on reviews of the Veteran's medical records and in-person examination of the Veteran.  Therefore, the Board finds the examination reports are entitled to significant probative weight as to the severity of the disability at the time of the examinations.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  In addition, no other medical records during this period support a 100 percent disability rating for the Veteran's depressive disorder during the appeal period.   

Based on the totality of the record, the Board finds that the evidence fails to establish the Veteran experienced total occupational and social impairment as a result of her depressive disorder.  While there is no doubt the Veteran had had deficiencies in her occupational and social functioning, this nature and degree of impairment is accounted for in her assigned 70 percent rating.  The Board finds that the facts of this case do not show that the Veteran experienced total occupational and social impairment as a result of her depressive disorder, as required for a 100 percent schedular rating under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  

Therefore, a rating in excess of 70 percent for depressive disorder is denied.   

3. Evaluation of tinnitus, which is currently 10 percent disabling, is continued.

The Veteran's tinnitus is rated 10 percent pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260, for recurrent tinnitus.  She seeks a rating in excess of 10 percent.

A 10 percent rating is the highest rating available under Diagnostic Code 6260.  The Veteran underwent VA examinations in April 2013, December 2014, and October 2022.  During the examinations, the Veteran reported she gets dizzy from her tinnitus and has to sit down.  Furthermore, she noted her tinnitus is distracting and interferes with her communication and ability to hear.  

After a review of the evidentiary record, the Board finds the evidence weighs persuasively against a rating in excess of 10 percent.  The Veteran's reported tinnitus symptoms are contemplated by the rating criteria, and she is already receiving the maximum rating offered under the rating criteria.  No assertions regarding extraschedular consideration have been raised by the Veteran or the record.  Accordingly, the claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied as a matter of law.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994). 

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 10, 2014, for the grant of a TDIU.

The Veteran asserts that she is entitled to an effective date prior to December 10, 2014, for the grant of a TDIU.  The Board notes that the Veteran meets the schedular requirements for a TDIU since January 28, 2013, based on her 70 percent rating for depressive disorder and 10 percent rating for tinnitus, both effective January 28, 2013.  

The Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to a TDIU from May 1, 2014, the date the Veteran noted she became too disabled to work on her September 2022 TDIU application.  In addition, the Veteran's VA examinations and SSA records further note the Veteran stopped working in May 2014.  The Veteran's TDIU application noted she worked at the SSA from 1996 to May 2014.  The Veteran indicated that her mental health symptoms and tinnitus made her too disabled to work on May 1, 2014.  The Veteran's examinations, as noted above, showed the Veteran found it difficult to concentrate and focus on tasks due to her service-connected disabilities. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's depressive disorder and tinnitus would make it significantly challenging for her to function effectively in any work environment.  As such, based on the date the Veteran reported she became too disabled to work, May 1, 2014, the Board finds that a TDIU is warranted as of that date.  However, prior to May 1, 2014, when the Veteran stated she was still employed by the SSA, the Board finds that her service-connected disabilities did not preclude her from engaging in gainful employment.  

As such, an earlier effective date of May 1, 2014, is granted for a TDIU.   

5. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 10, 2014, for the award of basic eligibility to DEA.

The Veteran also claims entitlement to an effective date prior to December 10, 2014, for the grant of eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.  Essentially, her claim in this regard stems from her claim above regarding an earlier effective date for the grant of a TDIU rating.

Educational assistance is payable to the dependent children or spouses of veterans under certain circumstances; the existence of a permanent and total disability rating for service-connected disability is a requirement for eligibility for DEA benefits.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021.  A total disability may be assigned where a veteran's service-connected disabilities are rated as 100 percent disabling under the rating schedule, or if the veteran is unemployable due to service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341.

In this case, an earlier effective date for the award of DEA benefits is warranted as of May 1, 2014, as this was the date the evidence showed the Veteran to have a total service-connected disability permanent in nature, due to the grant of a TDIU rating effective that same date, assigned herein.  DEA benefits may not be awarded prior to the effective date of an award for a permanent and total disability rating.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510.

Accordingly, the Board grants the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for basic entitlement to DEA benefits under Chapter 35, effective May 1, 2014.
