ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied. 

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depression and anxiety, is remanded. 

Entitlement to service connection for athlete's foot, to include tinea pedis, is remanded. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has not been diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) purposes.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from September 2016 to November 2022. 

This appeal is being processed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a July 2023 and August 2023 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO), an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in November 2023. The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 and August 2023 AOJ decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. As to the claims of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder and athlete's foot, because the Board is remanding those claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

As the Veteran has claimed service connection for both anxiety and depression, the issues have been consolidated and expanded to encompass all diagnosed psychiatric disorders. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing.

The Veteran asserts that his claimed bilateral hearing loss is related to his active military service. Upon review of all evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's service connection claim must be denied.

Under the relevant laws and regulations, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Generally, to establish service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of 1) a current disability, 2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and 3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Where a veteran who served for ninety days or more during a period of war (or during peacetime service after December 31, 1946) develops certain chronic diseases, to include high frequency sensorineural hearing loss an organic disease of the nervous system, to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from separation from service, such diseases may be presumed to have been incurred in service even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).

Alternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). However, the use of continuity of symptoms to establish service connection is limited only to those diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) and does not apply to other disabilities which might be considered chronic from a medical standpoint. See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Initially, the Board points out that the existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 and 1131 as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary). In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The determination of whether a veteran has a disability based on hearing loss is governed by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. For the purposes of applying the law administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. "[W]hen audiometric test results at a veteran's separation from service do not meet the regulatory requirements for establishing a disability at that time, he or she may nevertheless establish service connection for a current hearing disability by submitting evidence that the current disability is causally related to service." Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 160 (1993). The threshold for normal hearing is from zero to 20 decibels, and higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss. Id. at 157.

Here, a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss is not of record. The Veteran was afforded a VA audiological examination in August 2023. The examiner documented Maryland CNC speech discrimination scores of 100 percent bilaterally. The following pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were documented:

Hertz?? 	500	1000?	2000?	3000?	4000?

Right ear?? 	20	10	5	20	25

Left ear?? 	20	5	5	15	30

As evidenced above, on examination, the Veteran was not shown to have bilateral hearing loss disability for VA purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The Board notes that the objective findings for speech discrimination and the auditory thresholds of either ear do not meet the impaired hearing criteria for VA disability purposes. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. A VA hearing loss diagnosis is based on documented pure tone thresholds in the frequency range of 500-4000 Hz, with auditory threshold in any of the frequencies at 40 decibels or greater, at least three of the frequencies at 6 decibels or greater, or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. Although the VA examiner noted that the Veteran has sensorineural hearing loss, none of the audiological test results meet VA regulatory requirements for a hearing loss diagnosis as documented above. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Thus, the Board finds that the present disability element for service connection for bilateral hearing loss has not been established.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's statements about experiencing hearing loss, and he is competent to make those statements. However, in reviewing the medical evidence of record, the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). As such, there can be no valid claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss. Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Giplin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225. 

The Board also acknowledges that the Veteran's complete service treatment records (STRs) were not of record prior to the issuance of the rating decision on appeal. Nonetheless, as there is no current disability of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes, a remand to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error would serve no purpose. 38 C.F.R. §?20.802(a). The Veteran is encouraged to file another claim for service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability if his hearing loss worsens in the future.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depression and anxiety. 

Entitlement to service connection for athlete's foot, to include tinea pedis.

For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that a remand is proper. 38 C.F.R. §?20.802(a). In this regard, the Veteran attributes his psychiatric disorder and athlete's foot condition to his military service. See November 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim. The Veteran underwent a VA mental health disorders examination in January 2023. He was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder with anxious distress at that time. Similarly, at a February 2023 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with tinea pedis. No nexus opinion was obtained with respect to either claim. In the July 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claims based on the lack of in-service incurrence and nexus. However, a review of the Veteran's file shows that his complete STRs were not of record prior to the issuance of the rating decision on appeal. See May 2023 STR Request Status Pending. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's STRs and VA opinions should have been obtained prior to issuance of rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§?20.802(a); 3.159(c)(2) and (4). Thus, a remand to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors is necessary. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain any outstanding military personnel records and STRs and associate those records with the claims file in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

2.  Forward the claims file to an appropriately qualified VA clinician and request the clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depression and anxiety, and athlete's foot, to include tinea pedis. The necessity of an in-person examination is left to the discretion of the examiner. The examiner is asked to provide an opinion as to:

a)	For any acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depression and anxiety, is it at least as likely as not that the condition had its onset during service or is related to any in-service disease, event, or injury?

b)	For any diagnosis of athlete's foot, to include tinea pedis, is it at least as likely as not that the condition had its onset during service or is related to any in-service disease, event, or injury? 

The examiner is asked to address the complete evidence of record, including the STRs and the Veteran's lay statements. A complete rationale for all opinions provided is required.
