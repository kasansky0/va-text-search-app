ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 24, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for radiculopathy of the left upper extremity circumflex and lower nerve group is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was granted service connection for chronic cervical spine strain with an initial evaluation of 10 percent in a July 1993 rating decision; the Veteran was notified of the decision but did not file a notice of disagreement or submit any new and material evidence prior to the expiration of the appeal period, and the decision became final.  

2. On March 24, 2022, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, which included a claim for an increased rating for his service-connected cervical spine disability, as well as a claim for service connection for a left arm nerve "loss of feeling."  

3. In an August 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was denied service connection for a left arm nerve condition; notification was sent on August 12, 2022. 

4. On August 8, 2023, VA received a VA Form 20-0995 supplemental claim that included a claim for an increased evaluation for degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine and service connection for a left arm condition; in support of the supplemental claim, the Veteran submitted an August 2023 VA Form 21-4138 that stated his neck pain had progressed and worsened, with radiating numbness, sharp shooting pains, weakness, loss of coordination, and loss of use of his left arm and hand "for years." 

5. A November 2023 rating decision granted service connection for left upper extremity radiculopathy of the circumflex and lower nerve group, evaluated at 20 percent, effective October 12, 2022. 

6. In November 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, seeking an earlier effective date for service connection for left upper extremity radiculopathy of the circumflex and lower nerve group. 

7. An April 2024 higher-level review rating decision denied an effective date earlier than October 12, 2022, for the grant of service connection for radiculopathy of the left upper extremity circumflex and lower nerve group; in June 2024, the Veteran filed this appeal for an earlier effective date.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 24, 2022, for the grant of service connection for radiculopathy of the left upper extremity circumflex and lower nerve group have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.156, 3.400, 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1988 to April 1989, and August 1990 to April 1993, with additional service in the Reserves.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and requested review of a November 2023 rating decision that granted service connection for radiculopathy of the left upper extremity circumflex and lower nerve group with an evaluation of 20 percent, effective October 12, 2022.  The April 2024 higher level review rating decision only considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior November 2023 rating decision. 

In a June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected Direct Review.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision, which was later subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 12, 2022, for service connection for radiculopathy of the left upper extremity circumflex and lower nerve group.

The Veteran contends entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for radiculopathy of his left upper extremity circumflex and lower nerve group; specifically, an effective date of March 22, 2024, based on continuous pursuit of his initial claim.  See November 2023 Addendum Brief to VA Form 20-0996, June 2024 VA Form 10182, June 2024 Addendum Brief to VA Form 10182.  

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date for an award of service connection is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date is the later of the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

The date of receipt shall be the date on which a claim, information or evidence was received by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).  Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim is a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p); see also Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009).  From March 4, 2015, a claim must be filed on a designated VA form.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  If VA receives a complete application appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.  

As previously outlined, the Veteran filed an initial claim for service connection for a "left arm nerve condition (loss of feeling)" on March 24, 2022.  The Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued entitlement to for service connection of radiculopathy of the left upper extremity circumflex and lower nerve group by filing a supplemental claim within a year of the August 2022 rating decision that denied service connection for a left arm nerve condition; a request for higher level review within a year of the November 2023 rating decision that granted service connection; and this June 2024 appeal within a year of the April 2024 higher level review rating decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (h).  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran preserved his eligibility for an earlier effective date based on the March 24, 2022, date of claim for service connection for a left arm nerve condition.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.2500.   

However, the effective date of service connection for a disability is either the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 25 (2000).  Therefore, the Board must next determine when the Veteran's left upper extremity radiculopathy first manifested.

The Veteran's private treatment records showed spondylosis at C5-C6 and C6-C7 as early as September 2008, with corresponding notations of hypertonic trapezius, rhomboids, and levator scapulae.  See September 2008 Total Vitality Medical Group Imaging, Dr. T.S.  When the Veteran sought VA treatment for his chronic cervicalgia in August 2021, he complained of ongoing, increased neck pain and stiffness, and corresponding VA imaging showed multilevel degenerative changes of his cervical spine with moderate intervertebral disc space narrowing at C2-C3, C3-C4, C5-C6 and C6-C7; bony encroachment of the neural foramen; and multilevel spondylosis.  See August 2021 VA Radiology Report, August 2021 Primary Care Letter.  The Veteran reported that he had retired from formal law enforcement due to significant pain and weakness in his left arm that impacted his grip and coordination and prevented him from being able to load his weapon.  See December 2021 VA Mental Health Note, August 2022 VA Physical Medicine Note, October 2022 VA Mental Health Note.  The Veteran claimed "loss of feeling" in his initial claim.  See March 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.  During the April 2022 VA neck conditions examination, the Veteran reported his neck pain had "gotten worse" since it began in service, with radiating pain and weakness to his left hand that prevented him from being able to properly load and hold his weapon.  See April 2022 VA Neck Conditions Examination.  In his August 2023 statement in support of service connection for his left arm nerve condition, the Veteran stated that "as the years have passed" the pain in his neck and upper back became progressively worse, with sharp pain "shooting down" from the left side of his neck to his elbow causing numbness, weakness, and loss of coordination in his left arm and hand.  See August 2023 VA Form 21-4183.  

During the October 2023 VA peripheral nerve examination, the Veteran's history of ongoing and worsening symptoms was noted, and the examiner observed the loss of grip and pinch strength in his left upper extremity, with decreased sensation in his inner and outer left forearm, hand, and fingers, and diagnosed moderate incomplete paralysis of his circumflex and lower radicular group peripheral nerves.  In a corresponding VA opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's upper extremity radiculopathy was directly related to his service-connected cervical disability, explaining that when degenerative changes of the vertebral discs of the neck occur, it will typically result in compression of the spinal cords or nerve root resulting in chronic neck, shoulder, and arm pain, with muscle weakness or sensory symptoms.  See October 2023 VA Opinion, November 2023 VA Addendum Opinion.  Because the Veteran's left upper extremity radiculopathy symptoms manifested prior to March 2022, the date of claim for the grant of service connection is later than the date of entitlement.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of at least March 24, 2022, for the grant of service connection for left upper extremity radiculopathy of the circumflex and lower nerve group. 

The Board acknowledges that Note 1 following the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine provides for separate ratings of neurological manifestations under an appropriate diagnostic code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5235-5243, Note 1.  Therefore, the Board has also considered whether the Veteran could be entitled to an effective date earlier than March 24, 2022, for radiculopathy of the left upper extremity based upon evidence showing that it was factually ascertainable that his service connected cervical spine disability worsened within the year prior to his claim for an increased evaluation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o), see also Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  However, because the Veteran has been service connected and separately rated for radiculopathy of his bilateral upper extremities, this decision will only address the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for his left upper extremity raised by the Veteran in the June 2024 appeal currently before the Board.  See November 2023 Addendum Brief to VA Form 20-0996, November 2023 Rating Decision, January 2025 Rating Decision; see also DeHart v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 371 (2024).  

Here, as previously outlined, the July 1993 rating decision that granted service connection and an initial rating for chronic strain of the cervical spine became final because the Veteran did not appeal the decision, and no new and material evidence was received or submitted within one year of the Veteran's notice of that decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156.   

The next correspondence that can be interpreted as a claim for increased rating of the Veteran's service-connected cervical spine disability also included a separate claim for service connection for left arm nerve "loss of feeling" was received on March 24, 2022.  See March 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.  

However, as previously outlined, the Board finds that the evidence shows worsening of the Veteran's service-connected chronic neck strain, to include radiculopathy, prior to March 24, 2021.  Specifically, September 2008 private imaging showed spondylosis at C5-C6 and C6-C7, and August 2021 VA imaging showing multilevel degenerative changes of his cervical spine with moderate intervertebral disc space narrowing at C2-C3, C3-C4, C5-C6 and C6-C7, with multilevel spondylosis.  See September 2008 Total Vitality Medical Group Imaging, Dr. T.S., August 2021 VA Radiology Report, August 2021 Primary Care Letter.  The Veteran's VA treatment records and statements indicate ongoing, increased neck pain and stiffness, with significant pain and weakness in his left arm that impacted his grip and coordination and prevented him from being able to load his weapon.  See December 2021 VA Mental Health Note, August 2022 VA Physical Medicine Note, October 2022 VA Mental Health Note.  During VA examinations, and in a statement in support of his claim, the Veteran reported that his neck pain had "gotten worse" since it began in service, and "as the years passed", included radiating pain and weakness to his left hand, with sharp, shooting pains from his neck to his elbow causing numbness, weakness, and loss of coordination in his left arm and hand.  See April 2022 VA Neck Conditions Examination, August 2023 VA Form 21-4183, October 2023 VA Peripheral Nerves Examination. 

Therefore, as there is evidence that the Veteran's service-connected neck condition worsened more than a year prior to the date VA received his VA Form 21-526EZ claim for an increased evaluation, and the evidence shows symptoms of radiculopathy prior to March 24, 2021, the Board finds that entitlement to an effective date for service connection for radiculopathy of the left upper extremity earlier than March 24, 2022, based on the Veteran's claim for an increased evaluation for his service-connected cervical spine disability, is not warranted. 

A review of the claims file does not show that an intent to file or a formal or informal claim for an increased evaluation for service-connected cervical disability, or service connection for a left upper extremity nerve condition was received between the final July 1993 rating decision and prior to March 24, 2022.  Therefore, the earliest effective date possible for the Veteran's claim is March 24, 2022, the date of his VA Form 21-526EZ.

The Board is sympathetic to the fact that the Veteran has been suffering from symptoms of radiculopathy of his left upper extremity prior to the currently assigned effective date.  However, the Board is obligated to apply the law as Congress has created it.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); 38 C.F.R. § 20.105.  Accordingly, as the criteria for an effective date of March 24, 2022, but no earlier, are met, the claim for an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for radiculopathy of the left upper extremity circumflex and lower nerve group is granted.
