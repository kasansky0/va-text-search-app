ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating of 30 percent for migraines is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, his migraines manifest in no more than characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial rating of 30 percent for migraines have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1988 to July 1991. 

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an August 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran filed his timely VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and chose direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). 

Accordingly, the Board will consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

Entitlement to an initial rating of 30 percent for migraines

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings based on average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a). Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss each piece of evidence submitted by the Veteran or on his behalf. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (2000). Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claims and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claims. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000).

The Board is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran's migraines are rated according to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124(a), DC 8100. Pursuant to DC 8100, a 10 percent rating is warranted for characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months. A 30 percent rating is warranted for characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once per month over the last several months; and a 50 percent rating is warranted for very frequent, completely prostrating, and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124(a). These rating criteria are considered successive, meaning that a Veteran cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating. See Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018). This renders 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable. Id. at 252.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings to describe the nature and severity of headaches; however, it is not defined by regulation. Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 94 (33rd ed. 2020), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion, powerlessness, or lack of vitality. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018). The term "completely," as used before "prostrating" in the 50 percent criteria, means that the Veteran must be rendered entirely powerless and that "productive of severe economic inadaptability" means either producing or capable of producing severe economic inadaptability. Id. at 253.

The term "very frequent" is not defined in the regulation, but looking at the rating criteria as a whole, and noting that a 10 percent rating is warranted when prostrating attacks occur one in two months over the last several months, and a 30 percent rating is warranted when prostrating attacks occur once a month over the last several months, the 50 percent rating must logically require a frequency of prostrating attacks proportionally greater than once per month.

The Veteran contends, through counsel, that he is entitled to a compensable evaluation for his service-connected migraine of at least 30 percent. 

In a July 2023 statement, the Veteran explained that he experienced tinnitus bilaterally and it often preceded his headaches. The Veteran stated that after his tinnitus interferes with his hearing, he gets more stressed, and the tension builds up. The Veteran reported his headaches occur three to four times a month. At least once a month, the Veteran stated the migraines knock him ot of commission and causes incapacitation. The Veteran also described his symptoms of light sensitivity, noise sensitivity, vertigo, dizziness, and throbbing pain. 

In an August 2023 VA headaches examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with migraines. The examiner described the Veteran's symptoms as pulsing or throbbing headache pain on both sides of the head, nausea, and with sensitivity to light and sound. The duration was usually less than a day, and there were no characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine or non-migraine headache pain. The Veteran was noted as taking Tylenol, gabapentin, and meloxicam. The examiner concluded that the headache condition did not impact the Veteran's ability to work. 

Based on the foregoing and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that a 30 percent initial rating, but no higher, for the Veteran's migraines is warranted. The VA examiner did not find that the Veteran had prostrating attacks of migraine or non-migraine headaches. The Board notes that it is unclear whether the August 2023 VA examiner considered the ameliorative effects of the Veteran's medication, when evaluating the severity of the Veteran's migraine headaches. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). However, the Board has weighed that evidence against the Veteran's statements about the frequency and severity of his headaches. The Board finds that, when balancing the objective medical evidence and lay evidence of record, and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, a 30 percent rating is most appropriate. The Veteran is competent to report readily observable symptoms. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Given these competent and credible statements, the Board finds that the Veteran's migraines cause a level of exhaustion, powerlessness, or lack of vitality that represented a "prostrating" attack at least once a month.

A higher 50 percent rating is not warranted unless the Veteran's migraines manifest in very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. The record is not clear whether the reported attacks of migraine pain were merely "prostrating" or reached the higher criteria of "completely prostrating." The Veteran reported being out of commission for four hours when having a migraine. But, even if "completely prostrating" is conceded based on reasonable doubt, the criteria for the 50 percent rating are still not met because "prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability" are not shown.

The evidence of record does not suggest that the Veteran's migraines manifest to this level of severity. The Veteran's treatment records are silent for any complaints relating to headaches of this severity, and no medical examiner has found that the Veteran's headaches reach this level of severity. The record is silent as to the actual duration in minutes or hours of the "prostrating" portion of the migraine attacks. The VA examination noted less than a day average duration for each migraine. The record is also silent as to which days of the week or time of day the "prostrating" portion of the migraine attacks occur. The August 2023 VA examiner opined that the headache condition did not impact the Veteran's ability to work. Thus, the Board finds as a fact in this case that the Veteran's migraines are not so severe as to manifest in very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. Consequently, a higher 50 percent rating is not warranted under DC 8100.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence is in approximate balance regarding the nature and severity of the Veteran's migraine headaches. Thus, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board further finds that an initial rating of 30 percent for migraines, but no greater, is warranted and to that extent, the claim is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.16(b); Lynch, 21 F. 4th at 776.
