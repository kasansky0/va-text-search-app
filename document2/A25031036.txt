REMANDED

Entitlement to additional VA educational assistance benefits under Chapter 30, Title 38, United States Code (Montgomery GI Bill) and/or Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (Post-9/11 GI Bill), is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 2011 to February 2015, and from November 2017 to September 2022. He also served on active duty from September 2022 to present with the United States Public Health Service (USPHS).

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2023 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the February 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to additional VA educational assistance benefits under Chapter 30, Title 38, United States Code (Montgomery GI Bill) and/or Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (Post-9/11 GI Bill), is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a total of 48 months of educational benefits based on his inter-service transfer to the United States Public Health Service (USPHS).

The Post 9/11 GI Bill provides for VA educational assistance for members of the Armed Forces based on creditable active duty service after September 10, 2001. 38 U.S.C. § 3301.

In general, an individual entitled to educational assistance under Chapter 33 is entitled to a number of months of educational assistance equal to 36 months. 38 U.S.C. § 3312(a).

Notwithstanding the above and relevant to the issue currently before the Board, laws administered by VA provide a limit on training under two or more programs. Specifically, the aggregate period for which any person may receive assistance under two or more of the following laws may not exceed 48 months (or the part-time equivalent): (1) Part VII or VIII, Veterans Regulations numbered 1(a), as amended; (2) Title II of the Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1952; (3) The War Orphans' Educational Assistance Act of 1956; (4) 38 U.S.C. chapters 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, and 36; (5) 10 U.S.C. chapters 106a, 1606, and 1607; (6) Section 903 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981; (7) The Hostage Relief Act of 1980; and (8) The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. See 38 U.S.C. § 3695 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 21.4020 (a). In sum, while an individual may be entitled to benefits under various education programs, a person may not receive more than 48 months of educational assistance under two or more educational programs, here, under Chapter 1607 and Chapter 33. See 38 C.F.R. § 21.4020; see also Carr v. Wilkie, 961 F.3d 1168 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (48 months is the maximum aggregate period of education benefits a veteran may receive under two or more identified programs).

In this case, the record indicates that the Veteran had more than one period of active-duty service. Recently, in Rudisill v. McDonough, Slip Op. 22-888 (Apr. 16, 2024), the United States Supreme Court found that servicemembers who, through separate periods of service, accrue educational benefits under both the Montgomery and Post-9/11 GI Bills may use either one, in any order, up to the 48-month aggregate benefits cap pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 3695 (a).

However, the Board finds that based on the available information, the Veteran's remaining months of entitlement under the Post-9/11 GI Bill may not be accurate. Furthermore, it is unclear from the record, whether the Veteran has utilized Montgomery GI Bill benefits, and, if so, to what extent.

Thus, the Board finds that the AOJ should provide an accounting and audit for the Veteran's Montgomery and Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Without a detailed accounting of how the Veteran's Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits were used, the Veteran has not had notice and a fair opportunity to challenge the AOJ determination on appeal. Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993).

Therefore, while this matter is on remand, the AOJ should also determine whether the Veteran meets the eligibility requirements under Rudisill to receive additional education benefits under either Montgomery GI Bill and/or Post-9/11 GI Bill.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Prepare an accounting regarding the Veteran's use of VA educational assistance benefits, to include Montgomery and Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance benefits. The accounting/audit should reflect the dates of each period of school enrollment, the amount of entitlement used during each period of enrollment, and the entitlement remaining after each period of enrollment. The accounting/audit should set forth the total amount of Montgomery and Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits used by the Veteran. The supporting evidence used for creating the accounting/audit with the audit report should be provided.

A copy of the accounting should be provided to the Veteran.

2. Readjudicate the Veteran's claim under Rudisill.
