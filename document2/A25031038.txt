3. Requests as to the same issue and same VA decision constitutes concurrent review of the issue is prohibited under the Appeal Modernization Act (AMA) review system.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

As concurrent elections for review are prohibited, the criteria for dismissal of entitlement to an increased rating for a bilateral foot disability are met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from March 2004 to March 2012.

The rating decision on appeal was issued June 17, 2023 that continued a 10 percent rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis and pes planus and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

Regarding representation, it is noted that, in March 2025, VA received a VA Form 21-22 appointing agent R. Darling. as his representative. The Veteran was previously represented in these matters Florida Department of Veterans Affairs (FLDVA). Relatedly, a July 5, 2023 letter from the Board to the Veteran informed him that his appeal had been docketed by the Board and it also informed that he had 90 days from the date the Board received his VA Form 10182 or until the Board issued a decision (whichever came first) to request a change in representation. Here, the March 2025 VA Form 21-22a was received after the expiration of the 90 days referenced in the July 2023 letter. Pertinent VA regulations states that if a change in representation is requested more than 90 days after certification, good cause must be shown for the change. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304(b) (eff. Feb. 19, 2019). The March 2025 request was made more than a year after the notification letter from the Board in July 2023. The Veteran provided no cause for his change in representation. Accordingly, the Board concludes that FLDVA is the Veteran's representative for the purpose of this decision. Id.; see also Perez v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 190, 194-95 (2012) (concluding that when the Veteran submitted a request to change representation more than 90 days after his appeal was certified to the Board, he did not avail himself of the "good cause" provision contained in 38 C.F.R. § 20.1305(b) (now 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304(b) (eff. Feb. 19, 2019). Additionally, the July 2023 letter copied FLDVA on the letter provided noticed that the Veteran's appeal was at the Board that it was nearing time for adjudication so the Board finds that the Veteran has been accorded full right to representation in all stages of this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.5 (2024). For future matters and considerations after this decision is issued, agent R. Darling will be the Veteran's representative of record (barring another change of representation).

Procedurally, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ seeking an increased rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis and pes planus in March 2023. In response, VA issued the June 2023 rating decision, Then, on June 23, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level review (HLR) of the June 2023 rating decision. A few days later on June 30, 2024, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement also concerning the June 17, 2024 rating decision.

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) adjudicated the Veteran's June 23, 2023 HLR request for an increased rating for a bilateral foot disability and issued an October 2023 HLR rating decision.

For the reasons identified below, however, this matter under docket number 230630-357953 is to be dismissed for a claims-processing error. A January 2025 letter from the Board informed the Veteran that after a more detailed review of the June 30, 2023 VA Form 10182, the Board found that your appeal request did not meet the necessary procedural requirements and provided 60 days to respond. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, claimants may elect to review a decision by the AOJ by filing a supplemental claim, HLR request, or Board appeal. Current regulations prohibit concurrent election of review of a VA decision under different appeal lanes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). In Terry v. McDonough, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) emphasized that concurrent elections are prohibited. 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). The Court held that a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option. The Court's holding was expressly predicated on finding that multiple administrative review requests were "not pending concurrently" as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); id. at 2-3. Accordingly, the Court's holding in Terry makes it clear that only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues. Id. 

As noted above, in January 2025, the Board sent the Veteran a letter, asking him to clarify his intent within 60 days of the date of the letter, or her appeal would be dismissed. See BVA NOD Clarification Letter (January 2025). The Veteran did not respond and 60 days have passed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c). As the Court noted in Hall v. McDonough, although the Board cannot dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, it may dismiss an appeal for a procedural defect. See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021) (stating that the Board may not dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction but may consider dismissing it for other non-jurisdictional reasons such as a procedural defect, where the Board improperly docketed in the modernized appeal system an appeal that was governed by the Legacy appeals system). The Board finds the June 2023 VA Form 10182 was an impermissible concurrent election and the docketing of the appeal with the Board was in error in violation of claims processing rules. The record does not raise waiver or forfeiture considerations.

As concurrent elections are prohibited, the present claim must be dismissed as a matter of law. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500 (b), 20.104.
