ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder disability, to include degenerative arthritis and tendinopathy, is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder disability, to include degenerative arthritis and tendinopathy, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that his current right shoulder disability began during service or are otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that his current left shoulder disabilities began during service or are otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right shoulder disability, to include degenerative arthritis and tendinopathy are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left shoulder disability, to include degenerative arthritis and tendinopathy are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant had active service in the United States Marine Corps from February 1978 to February 2006.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) of a March 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ)), which denied service connection for right shoulder and left shoulder disabilities.

In October 2023, the appellant submitted a notice of disagreement (NOD (via VA Form 10182)), appealing the August 2023 HLR rating decision to the Board, and requesting Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  

Evidentiary Window

As the appellant selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue(s) on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301. The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The appellant has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Service Connection

Generally, to establish a direct service connection claim a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1164, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Certain chronic diseases, such as arthritis, will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder disability, to include degenerative arthritis and tendinopathy is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder disability, to include degenerative arthritis and tendinopathy is denied.

The appellant contends that his current right and left shoulder disabilities are related to an in-service injury. See Fully Developed Claim, July 14, 2021; Statement in Support of Claim, July 14, 2021. Specifically, the appellant asserts that he injured his shoulders in November 1983. Id.

In the March 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the appellant had a current diagnosis of bilateral shoulder strain, degenerative arthritis, and tendinopathy. Favorable findings made by the AOJ are generally binding on the Board, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c); 20.801(a).  Such evidence is not present in this case. As such, the first element of Shedden, current disability, is met.  See Shedden, supra.

The appellant's service treatment records (STR) contain multiple reports of the appellant lifting weights however, they are silent for treatment for or complaints of a shoulder disability or symptoms. On an August 2005 Report of Medical History, the appellant indicated he was having painful shoulder, elbow, or wrist. See STR, August 19, 2005. The appellant reported that he was currently seeking medical treatment for painful elbows and was having daily numbness and tingling in arms and hands. Id. During a May 2006 VA examination, the appellant reported experiencing numbness and tingling bilaterally in his arms and hands. See VA Treatment Record-Examination Note, May 2, 2006. The appellant reported an onset of 2005, in the left fourth and fifth fingers. Id. The appellant made no mention of any shoulder symptomatology. Based on the foregoing, the second element of Shedden, in-service injury, is not met. See Shedden, supra.

Although arthritis is a presumptive condition under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309, the record does not reflect that the appellant's bilateral shoulder degenerative arthritis manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307. Post-service treatment records are silent for reports of or treatment for a shoulder disability until July 2022. See VA Treatment Record, July 29, 2022 (noting "Bilateral Shoulder Pain-conservative therapy. Community care x-ray). Moreover, the earliest notation of arthritis was in August 2022, over 15 years after discharge. Therefore, service connection on a presumptive basis is not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309; Walker, supra.

In January 2023, the appellant was afforded a VA examination in support of his claim. See VA Shoulder and Arms Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), January 11, 2023. The appellant reported that his bilateral shoulder disability began in January 1989 due to rope training, crawling, and night exercise training. Id.  He reported that he was seen throughout his military career and underwent physical therapy. Id. The clinician opined that it was less likely that the appellant's right shoulder and left shoulder disabilities were incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. See VA Medical Opinion, January 11, 2023. The following rationale was provided for shoulders: 

"Due to the facts:

(a) The Veteran's exam from 1978 (around the time of enlistment) lists no significant medical history,

(b) The Veteran's exam from 9/28/2005 (around the time of separation) has no shoulder issues listed,

(c) The Veteran's pre-employment exam from 9/26/2017 has [o] shoulder issues listed,

(d) The Veteran's STR is silent for shoulder issues,

(e) The Veteran is diagnosed today with right shoulder strain, right shoulder tendinopathy, and degenerative arthritis of the right shoulder, it is less likely than not the Veteran's diagnoses of right shoulder strain, right shoulder tendinopathy, and degenerative arthritis of the right shoulder incurred in or caused by (the) Veteran had complaints of arm pain in service/during service." Id.

Significant probative value is assigned to the January 2023 opinion because it is based upon consideration of the appellant's prior medical history, examinations, appellant lay statements, and describes the disability in sufficient detail. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295, 300-301 (2008); D'Aries v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?97, 104 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?120 (2007) (an adequate medical examination must provide a rationale and explanation for its conclusions). There are no other medical opinions of record.

Consideration has been given to the appellant's lay statements in regard to onset and continuity of symptoms. While the appellant is competent to report having experienced symptoms of shoulder pain, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case or determine that these symptoms were manifestations of a shoulder injury in service.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing.  Therefore, it is outside the competence of the appellant in this case because the record does not show that he has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination.? Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007);?see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). Moreover, low probative value is assigned to the appellant's statements regarding onset because in 2021, he initially reported he injured his shoulders in November 1983 and then during the 2023 VA examination, he injured his shoulders in January 1989. See Fully Developed Claim, July 14, 2021; Statement in Support of Claim, July 14, 2021; VA Shoulder Arm DBQ, January 11, 2023. 

Ultimately, the Board finds the January 2023 VA clinician's opinion to be the most probative. See Nieves-Rodriguez, supra. While the appellant currently has diagnoses associated with both shoulders, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that his current shoulder disabilities began during service or are otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  As no nexus has been established, the third element of Shedden, a causal relationship, has not been met.  See Shedden, supra.

As the evidence persuasively weighs against granting entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability and left shoulder disability, there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the appellant's favor and the benefit of the doubt?rule does not apply.? Lynch v. McDonough, 21?F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38?C.F.R. § 3.102.? Accordingly, the criteria for service connection are not met and the appeal is denied.
