DOCKET NO. 210629-169100
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The June 2021 request for Board review of a June 3, 2021, declaration of incompetency is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

On September 1, 2021, VA declared the Veteran competent.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

No determination of fact or law remains in disagreement, so the criteria for dismissal are met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 3, 2021, rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office declaring the Veteran incompetent to handle disbursement of funds. The Veteran filed a June 29, 2021, notice of disagreement seeking Board review of that decision. While the appeal was pending, VA issued a September 1, 2021, rating decision declaring the Veteran competent to handle disbursement of funds.

With that new declaration of competency, the sole issue on appeal-the prior declaration of incompetency-is no longer a matter in disagreement. That issue is moot, and no other issue of fact or law remains in disagreement. The Board therefore issues this decision to dismiss the matter. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
