DOCKET NO. 240717-455898
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's OSA is at least as likely as not due to her active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for OSA have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Air Force from April 2009 to July 2014. 

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) decision on their claim to seek review.? The AMA applies to all?initial?decisions issued after February 19, 2019.?? 

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2024 rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).? The Veteran timely appealed this rating decision to the Board in a July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  The Veteran requested the direct review docket, which limits the Board's review to evidence of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal.

The Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of the Veteran's right to change Board dockets under Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.?38?U.S.C. §?1110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement.?Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting?Shedden?v.?Principi, 38 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). The absence of any one element will result in a denial of service connection.

Service connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Additionally, service connection may be granted on a secondary basis when the evidence establishes (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.? See Wallin v. West, 11?Vet. App.?509, 512 (1998); 38?C.F.R. §?3.310.

Service connection must be considered on the basis of the places, types, and circumstances of a veteran's service as shown by his or her service records, the official history of each organization in which he or she served, his or her medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.? See 38?C.F.R. §?3.303 (a); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) and Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

1. Entitlement to service connection for OSA

The Veteran maintains that her OSA is secondary to her service connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  However, the evidence demonstrates that her OSA is directly related to service.

With respect to current disability,?the AOJ rendered a favorable finding in the April 2024 rating decision that the Veteran has a current disability of OSA, and the Board is bound by this favorable finding.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104(b)(4), 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).  Accordingly, the first element of service connection is satisfied.

With respect to in-service incurrence, the Board notes that a VA examiner identified obesity as a risk factor to OSA and the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) document obesity in-service.  Notably, the Veteran was not obese upon entry to service with a weight of 154 pounds and body mass index (BMI) of 26.4.  However, she gained 89 pounds during service.  Four months prior to discharge, she weighed 243 with a BMI of 41.7, which is classified as severe obesity.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the in-service incurrence element of this claim has been established.

The remaining question is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's in-service incurrence and her current OSA.  

In January 2024, a VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's OSA is most likely caused by her obesity, head and neck anatomy, family history, and sleeping position.  With respect to obesity, the examiner elaborated that the most common risk factor for OSA is obesity because fatty tissue in the breathing passage reduces the space for air to pass through.  The examiner elaborated that OSA is caused by repeated collapse of the upper airway breathing passage.

This opinion is thorough.  It is based on review of the medical record and prevailing medical literature, and it is supported by a complete rationale.  Accordingly, the Board finds that this opinion is highly probative.

In sum, the weight of the evidence supports finding that the Veteran's OSA is directly related to her active service, and service connection is granted. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102; 3.303(a), (d).
