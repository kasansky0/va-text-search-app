ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (also claimed as sleep disorder) (PTSD) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for other specified depressive disorder with substance use disorder is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. The Veteran did not have a current bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes.

2. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's hypertension had its onset in service or was otherwise caused by an in-service incident. The evidence is not in approximate balance.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had a PTSD diagnosis conforming to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. The evidence is not in approximate balance.

4. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his other specified depressive disorder with substance use disorder was etiologically related to his military service. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

2. The criteria for service connection for hypertension are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

3. The criteria for service connection for PTSD are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 4.125. 

4. The criteria for service connection for other specified depressive disorder with substance use disorder are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1998 to May 1999. He died in December 2023. The Appellant is his mother, who has been substituted for the purposes of this appeal. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2022 rating decision. In March 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) requesting both the Direct Review and Hearing lane. Subsequently, the Board issued a letter to the Veteran in March 2023, notifying the Veteran that his appeal was placed on the Direct Review Docket. However, given the Veteran's multiple selections on his Notice of Disagreement, the Board requested clarification regarding the appeal docket selection from the Appellant on December 17, 2024, in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (f). Thereafter, in January 2025, the Appellant sent another Notice of Disagreement curing the problem. 

In the January 2025 Notice of Disagreement, the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The presence of a current disability is the cornerstone of any service connection claim. Service connection is not warranted when there is no current disability. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992). "Current" means near the time the claim is filed or at any time during its pendency. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007). Disability "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity." See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding that pain can constitute a current disability, even without an underlying diagnosis, if it causes functional impairment of earning capacity).

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Appellant contends that service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted.

For VA purposes, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

In this case, the competent evidence of record does not demonstrate a current disability of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes. The Veteran underwent a VA evaluation in September 2022, where he did not have auditory threshold of 40 decibels or greater in one frequency; or 26 decibels or greater in at least three frequencies in both ears. Furthermore, the Veteran had a word recognition score of 100 percent in the right ear and 96 percent in the left ear. These findings are not consistent with hearing loss for VA purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Appellant maintains that the Veteran had hearing loss that is related to his military service. The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements during his September 2022 evaluation that he had hearing loss, especially in the left ear. The Board does not doubt that the Veteran experienced difficulty hearing. 

However, the issue of whether there is hearing loss meeting the criteria required for VA disability benefits requires specialized testing and interpretation of medical tests for specific numeric results. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). There is no indication that the Veteran had the medical training to self-test his hearing for puretone thresholds or provide Maryland CNC speech recognition results that would reveal hearing loss for VA purposes under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Similarly, the evidence in the record does not establish, nor does she assert, that the Appellant was competent to administer or interpret any such testing. Thus, neither the Veteran's nor the Appellant's lay evidence is competent evidence of a current disability, no matter how sincere.

Absent evidence showing a current hearing loss for VA purposes, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted and the Board need not discuss the other two elements of a service connection claim. Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding a current disability as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38U.S.C. §5107 (b), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The claim is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied. 

The Appellant is seeking service connection for hypertension.  The appeal period in this case started on February 22, 2022. The AOJ found that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension in July 2022. The current disability element of a service connection claim is established. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 

Hypertension refers to persistently high arterial blood pressure. For VA rating purposes, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160mm, or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101, Note (1). This provision also states that hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days. Id. 

Certain chronic diseases, including hypertension, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Veteran wrote on his claim form that hypertension was "developed while inserv[ice]" on January 5, 1999. However, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not reflect symptoms, treatment, or diagnosis of hypertension. His STRs reflect blood pressure readings of 131/76 in April 1998, 125/72 in May 1998, and 120/60 in May 1999. Thus, the April 1998 and May 1999 readings show diastolic pressure under 90 and systolic pressure under 160, which is not consistent with VA's definition of hypertension. 

The Appellant has not identified any incident in service that could have been related to the Veteran's hypertension. Here, treatment records in the claims file do not reflect that his hypertension manifested in service or within a year of his discharge from the military. Therefore, the evidence of record does not establish the in-service incident element of a service connection claim. While the Board does not doubt that the Veteran believed his hypertension started during service, his statement is not sufficient to establish that fact, because he did not have the medical training or expertise to diagnose the condition. Moreover, it is contradicted by the medical evidence which does not show that the Veteran's hypertension manifested in service or within a year of his discharge from service. Therefore, there is no basis for presumptive service connection. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was not provided a VA examination regarding his hypertension. For service connection claims, VA is obliged to provide examination or obtain a medical opinion in a claim when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service; (3) an indication that the disability or symptoms of disability may be associated with the established in-service event, injury, or disease or with another service-connected disability; but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on which to decide the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 85-86 (2006). Therefore, the duty to provide an examination is not limitless.

The McLendon threshold elements above must be satisfied before VA is obliged to provide an examination or opinion. Here, the evidence does not establish that an event, injury or disease occurred in service. A conclusory generalized lay statement that a service event or illness caused the claimant's current condition is insufficient to require an examination under McLendon. Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (rejecting appellant's argument that his "conclusory generalized statement that his service illness caused his present medical problems was enough to entitle him to a medical examination under the standard of [38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d)(2)(B).]"). Under such circumstances, VA's duty to provide a VA examination is not triggered. The Veteran's statement on his claim form that hypertension began in-service is a conclusory lay statement that is not medically competent and, as explained earlier, contradicts the blood pressure readings recorded during service. Therefore, the competent and probative evidence does not establish an in-service injury, disease, or event and the decision not to obtain a medical opinion was not a pre-decisional duty to assist error that warrants a remand.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether service connection for hypertension is warranted. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. The claim is denied.

3. Entitlement service connection for PTSD is denied.

Service connection for PTSD specifically requires medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the disability in accordance with the DSM-5, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred, and a link, established by medical evidence, between the current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304 (f), 4.125(a).

In this case, the appeal period started on February 22, 2022. To satisfy the current disability element of a service connection claim, the evidence must show that the Veteran had PTSD on or after February 22, 2022, or close to that date.  The Board concludes that the evidence of record does not establish that the Veteran had PTSD diagnosed in accordance with the DSM-5 at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky, 26 Vet. App. at 294; McClain, 21 Vet. App. at 321.

The evidence window in this case closed in November 2022. VA treatment records during the relevant period reflects that the Veteran reported a history of PTSD.  See e.g. August 2022 VA Hematology and Oncology Inpatient Note. The VA treatment records, however, do not specifically show when and where the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD. The Veteran had a positive primary care PTSD screen in January 2022, but a screening questionnaire result is not a diagnosis pursuant to DSM-5. Rather, it is a tool to determine whether further testing is needed. The Veteran was provided a VA examination in October 2022, where the examiner interviewed the Veteran and reviewed the claims file and concluded that the Veteran's symptoms do not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under DSM-5 criteria. The examination report goes through each of the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis established by the DSM-5 and explains how the Veteran did or did not meet each criterion. Thus, the Board assigns higher probative value to the VA examination, where the Veteran was specifically examined to assess the presence of PTSD, and less probative value to the general reporting of PTSD as a medical history or the PTSD screening test, which do not confirm a PTSD diagnosis based on the criteria.

Because the evidence does not establish a current disability of PTSD in accordance with DSM-5, the first element of service connection is not met, and the Board need not discuss the in-service incident or nexus elements of a service connection claim. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether service connection for PTSD is warranted. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. The claim is denied.

4. Entitlement to service connection for other specified depressive disorder with substance use disorder is granted.

The Appellant is seeking service connection for other specified depressive disorder. The AOJ found that the Veteran had a current diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder with substance use disorder. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. This establishes the current disability element.

The Veteran reported being assaulted in service. See July 2022 Statement in Support of Claim for PTSD. He reported that his psychiatric symptoms started in November 1998. See July 2022 Fully Developed Claim.  The Veteran reported that he acted out in service so he could be discharged. His statement is consistent with his military personnel records that document behavioral issues. The Appellant reported that she remembers a call informing her that her son was "involved with something." See October 2022. Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is approximately balanced as to whether the Veteran's other specified depressive disorder with substance use disorder began during service and/or is related to an event during service. Resolving the benefit of the doubt in his favor, service connection for depressive disorder with substance abuse is warranted. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The claim is granted.
