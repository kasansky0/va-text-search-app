DOCKET NO. 210929-278965
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided on June 16, 2021, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

A VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) was received on September 29, 2021, from a billing company that did not furnish the underlying non-VA medical services in question.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for payment or reimbursement of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on June 16, 2021, have not been met. 38?U.S.C. §?7105; 38?C.F.R. §§?20.202, 20.204.?

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In September 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182 by Benefit Recovery Business Associates (hereinafter, Benefit Recovery) electing the Direct Review docket to review an episode of care for June 16, 2021, that was denied on the basis that no authorization number was submitted for the claim, which is a billing requirement for pre-approved care.   

The Board finds that Benefit Recovery is not a proper claimant that may file a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement. 38?C.F.R. §?20.204 (a Notice of Disagreement may be filed by a claimant or by his or her representative if a proper Power of Attorney is on record or accompanies such Notice of Disagreement).?        

"Claimant" is generally defined under VA regulations as a person who filed a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA. 38?C.F.R. §?20.3(f), (g). 

Under Part 17 of the regulations, claimants for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical services for unauthorized treatment may include the veteran who received the services; the hospital, clinic, or community resource which provided the services; or a person other than the veteran who paid for the services. 38?C.F.R. §?17.123.? 

When viewed in context of authorized non-VA medical services, health care providers include entities authorized to furnish medical services to covered veterans that enter into bid contracts to establish networks of health care providers. See generally 38?U.S.C. §?1703(c), (h); 38?C.F.R. §§?17.4005, 17.4030. There is no indication under the applicable law and regulations that a non-veteran entity that did not furnish the underlying medical services may be considered a claimant.?        

Benefit Recovery describes itself as an "industry leader in healthcare technology and revenue cycle management." https://brsi.ai/about/ (accessed March 31, 2025).        The record does not reflect that Benefit Recovery is a health care provider as described in the regulations or that Benefit Recovery provided the underlying treatment to the Veteran on June 16, 2021, (the care was provided by Baptist Memorial Hospital), associated with the claim for payment for the authorized non-VA medical services. Moreover, Benefit Recovery is not a representative of the Veteran. See 38?C.F.R. §§?14.627, 14.629.?        

The Board finds the September 29, 2021, VA Form 10182 filed by Benefit Recovery did not initiate appellate review. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(a), (b)(2)(A) (notices of disagreement shall be in writing, shall identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees, and may be filed by the claimant, the claimant's legal guardian, or such accredited representative, attorney, or authorized agent as may be selected by the claimant or legal guardian.); 38?C.F.R. §§?20.202(a), 20.204.?        

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.?
