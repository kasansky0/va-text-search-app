ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for bronchitis is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire period under review, the Veteran's bronchitis did not manifest as Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV-1) of 71 to 80 percent predicted, or FEV-1/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of 71 to 80 percent predicted and testing for diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide by the single breath method (DLCO (SB)) was not medically indicated.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable rating for bronchitis are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.96, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6600.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1980 to October 1986.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In his June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that in his June 2024 VA Form 10182, he expressed a desire to appeal his erectile dysfunction evaluation as well.  However, the erectile dysfunction is on its docket pursuant to a February 20, 2024, VA Form 10182.  Therefore, it will be addressed in a separate decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which assigns ratings based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In determining the present level of a disability for any rating claim, the Board must consider the possible application of "staged ratings" for diverse symptoms meeting the criteria for different ratings in distinct time periods during the course of the appeal, whether it is an initial rating case or not.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

1. Entitlement to an increased rating for bronchitis

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to a compensable rating for his service-connected bronchitis. 

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a noncompensable rating for his bronchitis.  Chronic bronchitis is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6600. Ratings are assigned based on pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The acronym FEV-1/FVC signifies the ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity. DLCO (SB) is the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide by the single breath method. If the DLCO (SB) test is not of record, a lung disability should be evaluated based on alternative criteria, as long as the examiner states why the test would not be useful or valid in the particular case. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(2).

Under DC 6600:

"	A 10-percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 of 71 to 80 percent predicted, or FEV- 1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent, or DLCO (SB) 66 to 80 percent predicted.

"	A 30- percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 of 56 to 70 percent predicted, or FEV- 1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or DLCO (SB) 56 to 65 percent predicted. 

"	A 60- percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, or FEV- 1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or DLCO (SB) of 40 to 55 percent predicted, or maximum oxygen consumption of 15 to 20 ml/kg/min (with cardiorespiratory limit). 

"	A 100-percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 less than 40 percent of predicted value, or; FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, or; DLCO (SB) less than 40- percent predicted, or; maximum exercise capacity less than 15 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption (with cardiac or respiratory limitation), or; cor pulmonale (right heart failure), or; right ventricular hypertrophy, or; pulmonary hypertension (shown by Echo or cardiac catheterization), or; episode(s) of acute respiratory failure, or; requires outpatient oxygen therapy. 

38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6600.

When evaluating a disability based on PFTs, post-bronchodilator results should be applied to the rating criteria unless the post-bronchodilator results were poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results, in which case the pre-bronchodilator results should be used. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(5). When there is a disparity between the different PFTs so that the level of evaluation would differ depending on which test would be used, VA should use the test result that most accurately reflects the level of disability according to the examiner. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(6).

The Board finds that the objective evidence is against a finding of a compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected bronchitis. 

Specifically, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in February 2024.  During this examination, the Veteran reported that he was diagnosed with this impairment in 1992. The Veteran symptoms were coughing. He required no treatment including corticosteroid medications. He completed pulmonary function tests where pre-bronchodilator results were a FVC result of 90, a FEV-1 of 103, and a FEV-1/FVC result of 113. The post-bronchodilator results were a FVC result of 87, and FEV-1 result of 100, and a FEV-1/FVC result of 114.

Thus, there is no evidence that the Veteran's FEV-1 was of 71 to 80 percent predicted or that FEV-1/FVC was of 71 to 80 percent. The PFT results in the April 2022 examination report do not include values for DLCO. The examiner determined that testing for diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide by the single breath method was not indicated in the Veteran's case. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(2), if DLCO (SB) results are not of record, a veteran may be evaluated based on the alternative criteria as long as the examiner states why the results would not be useful or valid.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was treated for this impairment throughout the period on appeal.  However, none of those medical records reflect PFTs that a compensable rating could be based upon. 

In considering the appropriate disability ratings for all claims, the Board has also considered the Veteran's statements that his disorder is worse than the ratings he currently receives.  In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990). 

Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  While the Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses, he is not competent to identify a specific level of disability according to the appropriate diagnostic codes.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).

On the other hand, such competent evidence concerning the nature and extent of the Veteran's disability has been provided by the medical personnel who have examined him during the current appeal and who have rendered pertinent opinions in conjunction with the evaluations.  The medical findings (as provided in the examination reports) directly address the criteria under which the disorders are evaluated.

Therefore, entitlement to a compensable rating for bronchitis is not warranted.  The appeal is denied. The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
