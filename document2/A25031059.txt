ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service-connected disabilities render him unable to engage and retain substantially gainful employment.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement for TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.340, 3.341, 4.1-4.7, 4.16, 4.19.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1965 to December 1967.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The AMA creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400 (a)(1). The rating decision in this case was issued after February 19, 2019; thus, the AMA framework applies.

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

The Board notes that under the modernized system, appellants generally have a year to request to change dockets by modifying their Notice of Disagreement (NOD). See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). The Veteran has submitted evidence in support of his appeal which consists of a lay statement.  As such, since the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket and submitted additional evidence in connection with this docket election, the NOD may not be modified. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2). Thus, the Board is able to adjudicate this appeal prior to the expiration period for changing dockets.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to TDIU

The Veteran asserted he is entitled to TDIU because he is unable to obtain gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities.  See February 2024 VA Form 21-8940.  

VA will grant a total rating for compensation purposes based on unemployability when the evidence shows that a veteran is precluded, by reason of his service- connected disabilities, from obtaining and maintaining any form of gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

A TDIU may be granted only when it is established that the service-connected disabilities are so severe, standing alone, as to prevent the retaining or obtaining of substantially gainful employment. If there is only one service-connected disability, it must be ratable at 60 percent or more to qualify for benefits based on individual unemployability. If there are two or more such disabilities, there must be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a). For purposes of this section, disabilities of both upper or lower extremities will be considered a single disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a)(1).

Veterans who, in light of their individual circumstances, but without regard to age, are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation as the result of service-connected disability shall be rated totally disabled, without regard to whether an average person would be rendered unemployable by the circumstances. Thus, the criteria include a subjective standard. Unemployability is synonymous with inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. VAOPGCPREC 75-91 (Dec. 27, 1991); 57 Fed. Reg. 2,317 (1992). "Substantially gainful employment" is that employment "which is ordinarily followed by the nondisabled to earn their livelihood with earnings common to the particular occupation in the community where the veteran resides." Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991). "Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment." 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a) (2019).

For the reasons set forth below, the Board finds that a TDIU is warranted.

In this case, the Veteran is service connected for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hearing loss, and tinnitus. The Veteran meets schedular criteria for TDIU for the entire period on appeal.  During the period on appeal, the Veteran is service connected for PTSD at 70 percent effective December 2022, for bilateral hearing loss at 30 percent effective December 2022 and 40 percent effective February 2024, and for tinnitus at 10 percent effective August 2017.  The Veteran had a combined rating of higher than 70 percent for the entire period on appeal.

Thus, the Board turns to evaluating the Veteran's unemployability.  The law states that in order to establish entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities, there must be impairment so severe that it is impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). Consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or to the impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19 (2015); Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).

In Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019), the Court provided guidance as to the meaning of a veteran's ability to "secure and follow" such employment, noting that attention must be given to the veteran's occupational history, education, skill, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform occupational activities; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform occupational activities.

The Veteran reported that he has a high school education with one year of college education.  See February 2024 VA Form 21-8940.   The Veteran's military occupational specialty was a mortarman.  See DD Form 214.  He reported he worked for Home Depot from 1991 to October 30, 2023.  See February 2024 VA Form 21-8940.  Records indicate the Veteran went from full time to part time work beginning in 2017 at Home Depot.  See November 2017 VA examination. 

In terms of his PTSD, in November 2017 VA examination, the VA examiner found he has an occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  He reported his work schedule was reduced from full time to part time due to mental health.  The VA examiner noted his deficits in occupational functioning related to PTSD included chronic hypervigilance, difficulties concentrating, and recurrent psychological distress related to intrusive thoughts and memories of traumatic events in the military.  The VA examiner indicated triggers occasionally caused significant stress and manifested in panic symptoms, and his symptoms were exacerbated by nightmares and a long history of disrupted sleep.  His symptoms of PTSD included persistent negative emotional state, markedly diminished interest or participation, feelings of detachment and estrangement from others, irritable behavior and angry outbursts, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, problems with concentration, and sleep disturbance.  The VA examiner found his symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment of social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  The diagnoses indicated the Veteran has difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting.

In the Veteran's February 2023 VA examination for his PTSD, the VA examiner found the Veteran has an occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and/or mood.  The VA examiner noted marked physiological reactions to internal and external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).  The VA examiner also indicated the Veteran has a persistent negative emotional state, feelings of detachment or estrangement from others, irritable behavior with angry outbursts, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disturbance.  The VA examiner found the Veteran's symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  The VA examiner noted his symptoms also include difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or worklike settings, impaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence, and intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living.

In terms of the Veteran's service-connected hearing loss and tinnitus, the Veteran reported during the January 2023 VA examination that he is unable to hear a lot of people talking, and cannot understand church, movies, people at the bank or businesspeople.  He also reported his tinnitus can be very irritating.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's statements regarding his PTSD symptoms and symptoms related to his hearing loss and tinnitus.  The Board also acknowledges the December 2024 statement from the Veteran's friend detailing the increase in PTSD and hearing loss symptoms in recent years as well as the difficulties in interactions with others, short term memory, and exacerbation of PTSD symptoms due to hearing loss.  The Board finds that the Veteran and his friend have provided credible testimony regarding the functional impact of his service-connected PTSD, hearing loss, and tinnitus disabilities.

Based on the above evidence, the Board observes that the Veteran's VA treatment records and VA examinations reflect that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD, hearing loss, and tinnitus would impact his ability to sustain a gainful occupation even with reasonable accommodations.  As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, in combination, are productive of symptomatology that contribute to his difficulty performing occupational tasks, both physical and sedentary, such that he is rendered unemployable. Accordingly, the issue of entitlement to TDIU is granted on a schedular basis.
