ORDER

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The persuasive evidence of record weighs against a finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with OSA at any time during the appeal period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for OSA are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from March 2016 to March 2021.

This appeal stems from a September 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating action. In the September 2023 rating action, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for OSA. In July 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement and selected the Direct Review Lane. Accordingly, in adjudicating the issue on the merits, the Board is required to consider the evidence of record at the time of RO's September 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Generally, to establish service connection a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service." Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

A current disability is the cornerstone of a service connection claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The claims file does not contain any records of medical treatment for OSA and does not show that OSA has been clinically diagnosed.  A January 2023 Gulf War Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) is negative for complaints or treatment related to the claimed OSA.

There is also no lay or medical evidence of actual functional impairments related to the Veteran's claimed OSA. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir., 2018) (holding that the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability.").

In this case, the Veteran has not described any symptoms or impairment during the applicable appeal period that he has experienced which he believes was caused by OSA, to include the effects of any manifestations on his ability to work or perform his activities of daily life. There is also no evidence of any such impairment in the claims file.

The Veteran generally contends that he has OSA that is related to his in-service TERA or, in the alternative, the result of nose, ear and throat problems and sinusitis during service. See VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) and Veteran's representative's written argument to VA, received in August 2023 and July 2024, respectively. The Board notes that lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology and "may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection." Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). However, aside from his general assertions as to the etiology of his OSA, the Veteran has not provided any lay evidence in support of the claim, to include reporting the symptoms or impairment he has experienced which hs believes is diagnostic of OSA. It is noted that, for example, diagnosing OSA requires more than just having sleeping problems, but rather requires a polysomnography to establish a diagnosis. As such, determining whether a diagnosis is warranted is considered to be a medically complex question. As the record does not contain any specific competent lay evidence in support of the claim, OSA is not established on this basis.

As the record does not contain any competent medical or lay evidence in support of the claims, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have OSA and has not had the condition at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim for service connection for OSA. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a), (d).

Therefore, the record establishes that the Veteran does not have the claimed disability. Absent proof of the existence of the disability, there can be no valid claim. See Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Degmitech v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141 (1992). Accordingly, the persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for OSA and is denied.

While the Veteran has not been provided a VA examinations to investigate a link between his claimed OSA and military service, to include his TERA and complaints of nose, ear and throat trouble and sinusitis at service separation, the Board finds that one is not warranted. Unfortunately, here, the only evidence indicating the Veteran has OSA comes from his lay assertions within the context of seeking service connection. The Veteran's generalized lay assertions alone, however, are not sufficient to trigger the need for a VA examination under Mclendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006). See Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (rejecting a Veteran's argument that his "conclusory generalized statement that his service illness caused his present medical problems was enough to entitle him to a medical examination under the standard of [38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d)(2)(B).]").

Finally, the Board considered whether the circumstances warrant a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) examination. However, because the Veteran does not have OSA, a TERA examination is not required. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (38), 1168, 1710(e)(1)(c).  A TERA examination is only warranted when a Veteran submits evidence of a disability and evidence of participation in a toxic exposure risk activity during active military service.  Here, evidence of a OSA diagnosis has not been shown on either examination or in treatment records.

Finally, the Board notes the Veteran's representative's assertion that the claim should be remanded to afford the Veteran an opportunity to file a claim for service connection for nasal congestion/sinusitis. The Board can only remand the appeal to correct a pre-decisional error. Thus, if the Veteran would like to submit a claim for VA compensation for service connection for sinusitis/nasal congestion, he is invited to submit a claim for compensation on the proper form.
