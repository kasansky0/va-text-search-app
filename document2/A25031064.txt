REMANDED

The motion to revise, on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), a January 1994 rating decision that denied service connection for IGA nephropathy with chronic renal insufficiency is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served honorably on active duty with the United States Navy from May 1978 to July 1982.  Unfortunately, he died in December 2011, during the pendency of his claim.  The appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse and has been substituted as the claimant in this matter.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2019 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in this matter.

In April 2019, the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the March 2019 decision.  In June 2019, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2019 decision.  

In the December 2019 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge on February 13, 2024.  A copy of the transcript is associated with the claims file.

The Board notes that on the December 2019 VA Form 10182, the appellant requested an explanation as to the calculation of the award of past-due benefits.  By way of background, in the March 2019 rating decision on appeal, the RO awarded service connection for IGA nephropathy with chronic kidney disease with an evaluation of 60 percent effective November 1, 2010; the RO also determined that the criteria for special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate were met from the same date.  In the April 2019 VA Form 20-0996 HLR request, the appellant disputed the amount awarded in past-due benefits following the March 2019 rating decision, contending that the amount did not account for the award of SMC.  In the June 2019 HLR decision, the RO appears to have construed this as disagreement with the effective date of the award of SMC; however, the appellant has not appealed the effective date of the award of SMC.  As the AOJ has not adjudicated or otherwise addressed the appellant's contentions as to the amount awarded in past-due benefits following the March 2019 rating decision, the Board cannot adjudicate that matter herein.  The appellant may resubmit the review request to the AOJ or notify the AOJ that the issue remains pending.

The motion to revise, on the basis of CUE, a January 1994 rating decision that denied service connection for IGA nephropathy with chronic renal insufficiency is remanded.

Under the AMA, the Board may remand for correction of any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim.  See 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.802 (a).

In this case, in November 2010, the Veteran submitted a claim seeking service connection for a kidney condition, which was originally denied in a January 1994 rating decision.  In a March 2011 statement in support of claim, the Veteran alleged that "a clear and unmistakable error was made by the Navy and [VA]" in not recognizing that he first incurred his kidney disease during service in 1981.  The RO did not address the Veteran's CUE allegation prior to his death in December 2011.  A May 2015 rating decision continued to deny service connection for IGA nephropathy.  The appellant, as substitute claimant, submitted a notice of disagreement (NOD) in September 2015.  As noted above, in March 2019, the RO issued a rating decision granting service connection for IGA nephropathy with chronic kidney disease effective November 1, 2010, the date of the Veteran's claim.  The RO did not address the Veteran's March 2011 contentions as to CUE.  In the April 2019 VA Form 20-0996 HLR request, the appellant alleged CUE in the original rating decision that denied the Veteran's February 1993 claim of entitlement to service connection for a kidney condition.

In the June 2019 HLR decision, the RO determined that "[n]o revision is warranted in the evaluation of IGA nephropathy with chronic kidney disease."  In the body of the decision, the RO explained the criteria for establishing CUE but then analyzed the matter as a claim for an earlier effective date.  However, a motion seeking revision of a decision on the basis of CUE is completely separate from a claim seeking an earlier effective date for an award of disability compensation.  See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006).  The statutory provisions describing the procedures for adjudicating requests to revise prior rating decisions based on CUE provide that a claimant's request for revision of a decision based on CUE shall be submitted to the Secretary and decided in the same manner as any other claim.  38 U.S.C. ยง 5109A(e).  Each specific assertion of CUE is a separate and distinct claim that must be the subject of a decision by the AOJ before the Board can exercise jurisdiction over it.  See Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  To that end, the Board lacks jurisdiction over any theory of CUE that has not been adjudicated by the RO in the first instance.  See Id.; Jarrell, 20 Vet. App. at 323-33.

HLR is permitted only for review of non-final decisions issued in the modernized appeals system and only when a claimant requests such HLR within one year of the decision for which HLR is sought.  See 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.2500, 3.2601.  The regulations that provide for HLR do not permit an HLR decision to decide any new issues.  Id.  Here, the Veteran's allegation of CUE in the January 1994 rating decision that denied service connection for IGA nephropathy with chronic renal insufficiency is a separate issue requiring adjudication by the RO in the first instance, and the RO's initial adjudication of the CUE motion in the June 2019 HLR decision was procedurally incorrect.

Because the RO has not adjudicated the motion to revise, on the basis of CUE, the January 1994 rating decision that denied service connection for IGA nephropathy with chronic renal insufficiency in the first instance, the RO erred in satisfying a statutory or regulatory duty.  As such, remand is necessary for the RO to adjudicate the issue in the first instance. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Issue a rating decision that properly adjudicates in the first instance the motion to revise, on the basis of CUE, a January 1994 rating decision that denied service connection for IGA nephropathy with chronic renal insufficiency.
