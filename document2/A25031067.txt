ORDER

An effective date of April 14, 2009, but no earlier, for the award of a total rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability due to service connected disabilities (TDIU) is granted.

An effective date of April 14, 2009, but no earlier, for basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a May 2015 rating decision, the Regional Office (RO) implemented a Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision and assigned a 40 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected radiculopathy of the left upper extremity, assigned a 30 percent rating for the service-connected left shoulder disability, and assigned a 10 percent rating for the cervical spine disability, all of which were effective April 14, 2009.  The Veteran subsequently filed a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) with the assigned ratings.  

2. While the Veteran's claims for increased ratings were pending, in July 2015, the RO received the Veteran's completed VA 21-8940 Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation based on Unemployability. 

3. Effective April 14, 2009, the Veteran was unable to maintain gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of April 14, 2009, but no earlier, for the award of a TDIU are met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, 4.16.

2. The criteria for an effective date of April 14, 2009, but no earlier, for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35 are met.  38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from July 1971 to July 1976.  The Veteran passed away in October 2022.  The Veteran's surviving spouse has been substituted as the Appellant in this appeal.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2020 higher-level review rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which, in pertinent part, assigned effective dates of May 30, 2019, for the awards of TDIU and DEA.  

In November 2020, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the underlying July 2020 Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

If evidence was submitted during the period after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, and submit or identify this evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Lastly, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertions of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), including those contained in the November 2020 motion.  However, an assertion of CUE is an independent claim, not a theory of entitlement that can be considered part of another claim. See, e.g., Hillyard v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 343, 355 (2011).  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review a CUE claim in the first instance. Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 332-33 (2006).

Earlier Effective Dates

A request for a TDIU is not a separate claim for benefits. In Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that a claim for a TDIU is "part of the claim for benefits of the underlying disability" regardless of whether the claim is raised expressly or reasonably raised by the record. 22 Vet. App. at 453-54.  As such, a Rice TDIU is not limited to claims reasonably raised by the record. Thus, the Board must adjudicate any explicitly raised claim for a TDIU pursuant to Rice when it has been explicitly raised during the initial adjudication of a claim or a claim for a higher rating for an underlying disability. Once entitlement to a TDIU is at issue as part of a claim for a higher rating, a claimant need not appeal a denial by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) for the issue to be or remain in appellate status. Payne v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 373 (2019); Harper v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 356 (2018).

VA will grant a total rating for compensation purposes based on unemployability when the evidence shows a veteran is precluded from obtaining or maintaining any gainful employment consistent with her education and occupational experience, by reason of her service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability. Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524 (1993). In arriving at a conclusion, consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his age or the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

The Court has held that the term unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 has two components. First, there is an economic component which essentially contemplates an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Second, there is a non-economic component dealing with the individual veteran's ability to follow and secure employment. For the second component, attention must be given to: (a) the veteran's history, education, skill and training, (b) the veteran's physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities (e.g., sedentary, light, medium, heavy or very heavy) required by the occupation at issue, with relevant factors such as lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, reaching, auditory and visual, and (c) whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue, with relevant factors such as memory, concentration, and ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers and demonstrate reliability and productivity. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019). As sedentary is defined as "doing or requiring much sitting" the Board finds that sedentary employment is a job where the worker primarily sits down. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1123 (2003).

If there is only one service-connected disability, it must be rated at least 60 percent disabling to qualify for TDIU benefits; if there are two or more such disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

From April 14, 2009, the Veteran had a combined rating of 70 percent.  Radiculopathy of the left upper extremity was rated as 40 percent and osteoarthritis of the thoracolumbar spine was rated as 20 percent. His left shoulder disability was rated as 30 percent and his cervical spine disability was rated as 10 percent.  He had an additional tinnitus disability rated as 10 percent. 

From October 31, 2011, the Veteran had a combined rating of 80 percent.  Left upper extremity radiculopathy was rated at 40 percent.  Osteoarthritis of the thoracolumbar spine was rated at 40 percent.  Left shoulder rotator cuff injury status post-surgical repair with acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis was rated at 30 percent.  Bilateral hearing loss was rated at 10 percent.  Cervical spine fusion with degenerative disc disease was rated at 10 percent from April 14, 2009, and 20 percent from October 3, 2015.  Tinnitus was rated at 10 percent. 

From February 13, 2017, to May 29, 2019, the Veteran had combined service connected rating of 90 percent.  Left upper extremity radiculopathy was rated at 40 percent.  Osteoarthritis of the thoracolumbar spine was rated at 40 percent.  Left shoulder rotator cuff injury status post-surgical repair with acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis was rated at 30 percent.  Major depressive disorder associated with cervical spine fusion was rated at 30 percent.  Bilateral hearing loss was rated at 10 percent.  Cervical spine fusion with degenerative disc disease was rated at 20 percent.  Tinnitus was rated at 10 percent.  Left lower extremity radiculopathy was at 10 percent.

By way of history, the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for a cervical spine disability and left shoulder disability on April 14, 2009.  In an April 2015 decision, the Board granted service connection for cervical spine and left shoulder disabilities.  The RO implemented this grant in a May 2015 rating decision, and assigned a 40 percent disability rating for left upper extremity radiculopathy, a 30 percent disability rating for a left shoulder disability, and a 10 percent rating for a cervical spine disability, which were all effective April 14, 2009.  

In the Veteran's July 2015 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported having last worked on a full-time basis on June 17, 2006, stocking at Lowes.  He indicated that his lumbar spine and left shoulder disabilities impacted his ability to work.  

In January 2019, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) remanded TDIU, and the additional matters on appeal from rating decisions dated May 2015, October 2015, July 2017, and September 2017.  In May 2020, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Higher-level Review, VA Form 20-0996, disagreeing with sleep apnea.  In July 2020, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction granted TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance effective October 1, 2019, referencing the January 2019 Board remand.  In September 2020, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction granted TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance effective May 30, 2019, referencing the May 2020 Higher-Level Review.  In November 2020, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, disagreeing with the effective date assigned for TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance. 

Given the procedural background, the Veteran's TDIU claim was not a new claim but rather an implicit TDIU claim under Rice and commenced on April 14, 2009.  22 Vet. App. at 453-54.  

The July 2015 VA Form 21-8940 shows that from February 6, 2004, to June 17, 2006, the Veteran reported working stocking at Lowes.  From December 17, 2003, to February 6, 2004, the Veteran worked with produce at Ingles Markets.  From June 21, 2001, to December 17, 2003, the Veteran worked in the warehouse at Ingles Markets.  From August 17, 1996, to June 21, 2001, the Veteran as a helper at Times Plumbing.  The Veteran reported that his service connected spine disability and left shoulder disability prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation.  

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for his lumbar spine disability in August 2009.  He reported stiffness, fatigue, decreased motion, and numbness.  He noted severe pain with difficulty walking and sitting with limited motion.  He reported his last job at a grocery store warehouse in 2004. A June 2012 VA examination for his left shoulder reveals that his left shoulder disability impacted his ability to work due to his inability to move his left arm.  

The report of a September 2017 VA mental disorders examination conveys that "Post-military educational activities: during the military he got 2 years credit and when he got out he went to Indiana State and got his BA in Psychology and ABA in General Business" and "Post-military employment: first job was plumber's assistant, McDonald's, Burger King, truck driver, Ingles, and Lowes.  At Lowe's he got hurt real bad with his back."

The report of an October 2015 VA spine examination conveys that the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine disability impacted his ability to work, described as difficulty walking long distances, squatting, crouching, and crawling.  The report of an October 2015 VA spine examination conveys that the Veteran's cervical spine disability impacted his ability to work, described as being unable to look upward, turn to extremes for rotation (i.e. driving), and fatigue in cervical spine muscles. The report of an October 2015 VA peripheral nerves examination conveys that the Veteran's peripheral nerve disability impacted his ability to work, described as difficulty with left arm pain. The report of an October 2015 VA shoulder examination conveys that the Veteran's shoulder disability impacted his ability to perform any type of occupational task, described as difficulty with lifting, carrying, and moving.  The report of a December 2015 VA spine examination conveys that the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine disability impacted his ability to work, described as difficulty squatting, crouching, crawling, lifting, and bending forward.  The report of a March 2017 VA spine examination conveys that the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine disability may negatively impact his ability to perform heavy lifting, repetitive bending, prolonged walking, and standing.  The report of a July 2017 VA TDIU examination conveys that the examiner was unable to opine on unemployability, but indicated that functional limitation in the Veteran's disability may include moderate degree of impairment with physical labor and mild degree of impairment with sedentary labor.  The report of a July 2017 VA spine examination conveys that the Veteran's cervical spine disability impacted his ability to work, described as difficulty looking upward.  The Veteran may also have difficulty keeping head in a stationary position for a prolonged period of time.  The report of a September 2017 VA spine examination conveys that the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine disability impacted his ability to work.  "When he is sedentary[,] he has pain in the left leg, but no other symptoms."  "His active employment is limited with any physical activity that involves steps, bending or lifting due to pain.  The report of a September 2017 medical opinion conveys that "His Left LE radiculopathy may affect physical employment in jobs that require heavy lifting, prolonged standing or walking and step climbing or descending."

After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran has been unable to maintain employment due to his service-connected left shoulder, lumbar spine, cervical spine, and radiculopathy disabilities throughout the rating period on appeal, or from April 14, 2009.  In this regard, the Veteran would be unable to work as a stocking clerk or other similar work setting due to his service-connected musculoskeletal and radiculopathy disabilities.  Moreover, he has not been gainfully employed throughout the rating period on appeal, or from April 14, 2009. 

The Board has considered whether special monthly compensation at the housebound rate is warranted.  However, the Veteran does not have a single service connected disability rated at 100 percent or a TDIU due to a single disability and additional service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service connected disability.  Therefore, an award of special monthly compensation at the housebound rate is not warranted.

Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35

Basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits exists where a veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and has a permanent and total service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021.  The criteria pertaining to the award of educational benefits provides that effective dates assigned following the grant of benefits under Chapters 30, 31, 32, and 35 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to the effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 5113.

The Board has granted an effective date of April 14, 2009, for the award of a TDIU.  Therefore, an effective date of April 14, 2009, for basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35, is warranted.
