ORDER

Entitlement to an increased disability rating in excess of 30 percent for right knee osteoarthritis, status post meniscectomy and total right knee replacement, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's right knee osteoarthritis, status post meniscectomy and total right knee replacement, did not result in chronic residuals consisting of severe painful motion or weakness in the affected extremity, ankylosis of the right knee or its functional equivalent, ankylosis in flexion greater than 10 degrees or its functional equivalent, limitation of extension to 30 degrees or more, or malunion or nonunion of the tibia and fibula.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an increased disability rating in excess of 30 percent for right knee osteoarthritis, status post meniscectomy and total right knee replacement, have not been met for any period on appeal.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.14, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes (DCs) 5055, 5256, 5261, 5262.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1990 to July 1993.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2023 rating decision.  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2023 rating decision.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an increased disability rating in excess of 30 percent for right knee osteoarthritis, status post meniscectomy and total right knee replacement.

The Veteran seeks an increased disability rating in excess of 30 percent for his service-connected right knee osteoarthritis, status post meniscectomy and total knee replacement. See May 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. Following a review of the evidence, and as discussed further below, the Board finds the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim.

The Veteran's service-connected right knee disability is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5055, regarding resurfacing or prosthesis replacement of the knee.  The Veteran's increased rating claim for his right knee osteoarthritis arises from the Veteran's July 20, 2022 TDIU claim, which the Board notes is after the most recent February 7, 2021 amendments to the relevant rating criteria under DC 5055.

Effective February 7, 2021, DC 5055 provides a 100 percent rating for four months following implantation of a prosthesis or resurfacing. A 60 percent rating is provided for chronic residuals consisting of severe painful motion or weakness in the affected extremity. Intermediate degrees of residual weakness, pain, or limitation of motion are to be rated by analogy to DCs 5256, 5261, or 5262. The minimum rating for total replacement of the knee is 30 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5055.

Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are equitable and just as contemplated by the requirements of the law. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis. Painful limitation of motion which is otherwise noncompensable will be entitled to the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).  However, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011). 

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2018), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and the extent of functional impairment of flare-ups from the veterans themselves when a flare-up is not observable at the time of the examination.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use over time and therefore not be reflected on range of motion testing. Additionally, 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 44; see also DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206 (1995). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. A separate or higher rating under 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

The substantive provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.343 and 3.344 (for continuance of total disability ratings and stabilization of disability ratings) are not applicable in this case. This is because the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5055 contain a temporal element for continuance of a 100 percent rating following implantation of a prosthetic replacement of a knee joint. Thus, the discontinuance of a 100 percent rating following implantation of a prosthetic replacement of a knee joint under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5055 does not constitute a rating "reduction" in the legal sense and does not require application of the special regulatory procedures associated with rating reductions, apart from notice pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). See Foster v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 338, 345 (2021). This is because the plain language of the DC governs how the 100 percent rating is to be treated, including when it will no longer apply. Id at 346; see also Rossiello v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 430, 432-33 (1992) (finding that a 100 percent rating for mesothelioma ceased to exist by operation of law because the applicable DC involved contained a temporal element for that 100 percent rating).

Turning to the relevant evidence of record during the period on appeal, the Veteran received VA examinations for his right knee in January 2022 and January 2023. Chronic residuals consisting of severe painful motion or weakness needed for an increased 60 percent rating were not noted or evident on either examination. See January 2022 C&P Exam; January 2023 C&P Exam. Thus, a 60 percent rating under DC 5055 is not warranted.  Both examinations specifically note intermediate degrees of residual weakness, pain, or limitation of motion. Under DC 5055, replacement of the knee joint with intermediate degrees of residual symptoms is to be rated by analogy to DCs 5256, 5261, or 5262.

DC 5256 addresses ankylosis of the knee. A rating by analogy under DC 5256 is not warranted here because the Veteran's right knee is not ankylosed. Both VA examiners found that the Veteran did not have ankylosis of the right knee. The Veteran does not contend, and the available treatment records do not show, that he experiences ankylosis of the right knee. The Board has also considered whether he experiences symptoms analogous to ankylosis of the right knee, to include whether he experiences the functional equivalent of ankylosis under Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021). However, the most probative evidence does not show immobility of the Veteran's right knee analogous to ankylosis. The Veteran's range of motion measurements during the VA examinations, though abnormal, demonstrate that he does not have ankylosis in his right knee as the Veteran retains active range of motion in his right knee. As the Veteran does not experience symptoms analogous to ankylosis, his right knee osteoarthritis, status post total right knee replacement, cannot be rated by analogy to DC 5256.

DC 5261 addresses limitation of extension. A 0 percent rating is assigned where extension is limited to 5 degrees. A 10 percent rating is assigned where extension is limited to 10 degrees. A 20 percent rating is assigned where extension is limited to 15 degrees. A 30 percent rating is assigned where extension is limited to 20 degrees. A 40 percent rating is assigned where extension is limited to 30 degrees. A maximum 50 percent rating is assigned where extension is limited to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261.

Both January 2022 and January 2023 VA examinations showed that the Veteran had full range of motion on extension of his right knee during both active and passive motion and for the estimated range of motion with repetitive use. The Veteran did not report flare-ups on either VA examination. The January 2022 VA examiner was able to record range of motion results for the opposite joint. However, the January 2023 VA examiner was unable to record the range of motion for the opposite joint as the opposite joint was found to be damaged. Given the above, a rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted under DC 5261.

DC 5262 addresses impairment of the tibia and fibula, splitting the criteria into three categories: medical tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), or shin splints; malunion; and nonunion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5262. Both January 2022 and January 2023 VA examinations specifically found the Veteran did not have a tibial or fibular impairment of the right knee, to include recurrent patellar dislocation, shin splits, MTSS, stress fractures, or any other tibial or fibular impairment. Accordingly, an increased disability rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted under DC 5262.

The Board has also considered whether separate, compensable ratings may be assigned under diagnostic codes not specified under DC 5055.  DC 5257 addresses recurrent subluxation or instability in the knee as well as patellar instability. On both January 2022 and January 2023 knee examinations, no instability, subluxation, or patellar instability were noted. Also, the record does not show that the Veteran experiences instability in his right knee. See English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347, 349 (2018) (holding that objective medical evidence is not required to establish lateral knee instability under DC 5257). The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reported use of a cane for locomotion in January 2022 constantly and in January 2023 regularly. However, as it pertains to DC 5257, there is no indication in either the medical record or lay statements that the Veteran experiences instability. The Veteran does not have a history of falls, and he was not indicated to be at risk for a fall. In fact, the medical record and the Veteran's lay statements indicate the Veteran may use a cane to alleviate weight-bearing pain, rather than due to instability. Accordingly, a separating or increased disability rating is not warranted under DC 5257.

DCs 5258 and 5259 address disorders of the semilunar cartilage. DC 5258 assigns a 20 percent rating for dislocated semilunar cartilage with episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5258. The Board has considered the January 2022 VA examiner's finding of frequent effusions in the Veteran's knees, worse in his right knee than his left. Additionally, January 2022 diagnostic testing showed a "tiny effusion" in the Veteran's right knee. However, no episodes of joint "locking" or meniscal dislocation were reported or noted by the examiner. Thus, the Veteran does not meet the criteria for a separate rating under DC 5258 as there are no probative findings of joint "locking" or meniscal dislocation of record.

DC 5259 provides a 10 percent rating for the symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5259. Arthroscopic meniscal repairs from 1990 and 2009 were noted during the Veteran's January 2022 VA examination. The residuals of such surgery included pain, limited range of motion, and weakness. Although the Veteran underwent multiple meniscectomies of the right knee and continues to experience residual symptoms of pain and decreased range of motion, the assignment of a separate rating under DC 5250 would result in impermissible pyramiding as his residual pain and decreased range of motion of the right knee are already being compensated for under the rating assigned under DC 5055. Additionally, it is not beneficial to change the applicable diagnostic code to DC 5259 as it would not result in a rating higher than the 30 percent rating currently assigned under DC 5055. Therefore, a rating under DC 5259 is not warranted. 

DC 5260 provides ratings for limitation of flexion. Thereunder, a noncompensable rating is warranted for flexion limited to 60 degrees. A 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 15 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260.  The January 2023 VA examination showed right knee flexion to 80 degrees during active and passive motion and following repetitive use. The VA examiner noted evidence of pain upon weight-bearing and active motion but found additional pain did not result in or cause functional loss. The January 2022 VA examination showed right knee flexion to 100 degrees during active and passive motion and following repetitive use. No additional functional loss was found due to observed pain and weight-bearing activities. A rating under DC 5260 is not warranted because the Veteran did not have flexion limited to 60 degrees or less. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260.

Lastly, a separate rating under DC 5263 is not warranted, as the evidence does not show that the Veteran has genu recurvatum. Both January 2022 and January 2023 VA examiners did not find evidence of or a history of an acquired and/or traumatic genu recurvatum.

The Board has also considered the relevant lay evidence of record, including the Veteran's statements which are probative insofar as they report observable symptomatology.  However, to the extent that such statements assert that the Veteran's current right knee disability is more severe than that which is currently contemplated by his assigned 30 percent disability rating, he is not competent to opine regarding the severity of his right knee disability, as he has not been shown to possess medical or orthopedic expertise regarding a complex and internal disease process such as musculoskeletal arthritis. As such, the Veteran's lay statements of record are less probative than the objective January 2022 and January 2023 VA knee examinations discussed herein.

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the most probative evidence persuasively weighs against an increased disability rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's right knee osteoarthritis, status post meniscectomy and total right knee replacement for the entire period on appeal. Because the probative evidence weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable here, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
