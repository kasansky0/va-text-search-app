ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

At the time the Veteran filed the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, there was already a pending Board appeal regarding the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1968 to July 1971. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea most recently addressed in a January 2024 rating decision.  In July 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on December 9, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or the Veteran's representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Sleep apnea

Unfortunately, the Veteran's appeal of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea must be dismissed due to a procedural defect. See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021); 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

Under the AMA, a claimant may elect administrative review of an AOJ decision by requesting one of three review options, or lanes: (i) Higher-Level Review by the AOJ; (ii) Supplemental Claim; or (iii) appeal to the Board. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1). Once a claimant has filed for review under one of these options, he or she may not choose another lane of review with respect to the same claim or same issue contained within the claim until the higher-level review, supplemental claim, or notice of disagreement is adjudicated; or until the request for higher-level review, supplemental claim, or notice of disagreement is withdrawn. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). In other words, concurrent election, or electing multiple review options simultaneously for the same claim, is prohibited. See id. A claimant may change the review option selected by withdrawing the original request and filing the appropriate application for the requested review option within one year from the date on which VA issued notice of a decision on an issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(e)(1).

As the procedural course of the Veteran's claim is at issue in this appeal, a brief history is provided, including review of the Veteran's two concurrent appeals before the Board. In a May 2022 rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. In June 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, disagreeing with the May 2022 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. 

In November 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application seeking entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. As a technical matter, the AOJ should not have processed the Veteran's November 2023 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application since the same issue was already pending before the Board pursuant to the June 2022 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. However, in January 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. In January 2024, the Veteran again filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application seeking entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. In July 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. In September 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement disagreeing with the July 2024 rating decision and selected the Hearing docket. 

In January 2025, the Board remanded the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea in conjunction with the June 2022 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. 

The June 2022 VA Form 10182 and subsequent January 2025 Board decision is the contested initial decision and is pending final adjudication. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500; see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2. Thus, as the Board has already handled the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea in its January 2025 remand, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, as indicated in the September 2024 VA Form 10182, represents a later concurrent appeal before the Board. As the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, the claim is rendered moot. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.104. Accordingly, the claim must be dismissed.
