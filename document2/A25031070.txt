ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a recurrent sleep disability to include sleep apnea is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

A recurrent sleep disability to include sleep apnea was not manifested during active service or at any time thereafter.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a recurrent sleep disability to include sleep apnea are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from August 2018 to August 2022.

In September 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for sleep apnea.  In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 9, 2023, rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, and submit or identify this evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection for a Recurrent Sleep Disability

The Veteran asserts that service connection for sleep apnea is warranted.  

The service treatment records do not refer to sleep apnea or any recurrent sleep disability.  

In his August 2023 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran sought service connection for sleep apnea as the disability was "caused by an in-service event, injury, or exposure including "always sleeping very light due to the fact crash alarms, aircraft, phones ringing that you have to answer, sleep deprivation due to airfield hours."  

The remainder of the record does not refer to sleep apnea or other recurrent sleep disability.  

In his September 2024 Appellate Brief, the Veteran's representative conveyed that: "we believe he submitted a substantially complete claim;" "as such, we believe he should receive a VA examination as authorized by 38 CFR 3.159;" and "it is customary that VA will order VA examinations when the claim is filed within a year after discharge."

In disability compensation claims, the VA must provide a VA medical examination when there is: (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies; (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but; (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the VA to make a decision on the claim.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).  

In the instant appeal, the record is devoid of any subjective or objective evidence of the finding of a recurrent sleep disability.  Therefore, the Board finds that a VA examination is not needed.  

A recurrent sleep disability was not shown during active service or at any time thereafter.  Accordingly, service connection for a recurrent sleep disability, to include sleep apnea is not warranted.
