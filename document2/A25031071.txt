2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service with the United States Army from November 1965 through November 1967. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2025 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), hereinafter the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied service connection for tinnitus and BHL. The Veteran filed a Board Appeal: Notice of Disagreement, VA Form 10182, in January 2025, in which the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. As such, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the decision on appeal (January 6, 2025). The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the issuance of the decision on appeal (on or after January 7, 2025). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Veteran submitted a March 2025 written waiver of his opportunity to select a different Board review option as the time afforded the Veteran for selecting a different docket, pursuant to Williams, had not expired when the Veteran submitted his Notice of Disagreement. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty from active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that which is pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Where a veteran served continuously for 90 days or more during active service, service connection for certain chronic diseases, including bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, may also be established on a presumptive basis by showing that such a disease manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. § 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).  In such cases, the disease is presumed under the law to have had its onset in service even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a).  

Furthermore, if evidence of a chronic disability is shown in service or during the presumptive period, but is later diagnosed, such disability may still be service connected based on continuity of symptomatology.  In this regard, evidence of a chronic disease shown either in service (or within an applicable presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307, usually one year) and with chronic and continuous manifestations either beginning in service or since discharge from service, may permit service connection on the basis of continuity of symptomatology, unless otherwise attributable to an intercurrent cause. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) relating to continuity of symptomatology, however, can be applied only in cases involving those conditions explicitly enumerated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Tinnitus

As an initial matter, the Board finds that the Veteran has a current disability of tinnitus, which is capable of lay observation and diagnosis. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002); see August 2024 VA C&P Examination. 

Additionally, the RO's favorable findings included conceding in-service noise exposure, specifically that the Veteran was exposed to loud noise during service. Thus, the first two elements of service connection are met. The Board is left, then, to address the third element of service connection, a nexus tying the Veteran's tinnitus to his in-service event or injury.

Turning to the evidence or record, the Veteran was afforded an August 2024 VA medical examination to evaluate his tinnitus. The examiner noted that the onset of the Veteran's tinnitus was in 2004 and that the course of his tinnitus has been constant bilateral ringing, and that he presently suffered from constant bilateral ringing. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or the result of his conceded noise exposure. However, it appears that the negative nexus opinion is based on the fact that there were no complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for tinnitus during service or for 30 years post-service. Notably, the medical examiner did not discuss the Veteran's prior March 2023 Statement in Support of Claim, regarding his tinnitus, that he has had ringing in his ears since he was in basic training in 1965 and that he would have to use a box fan or some other white noise feature in order to go to sleep. 

A medical opinion is inadequate if it is based solely on the absence of documentation in the record and does not take into account the Veteran's reports of symptoms and history (even if recorded in the course of the examination). See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (examination was inadequate where the examiner did not comment on the appellant's report of in-service injury and instead relied on the absence of evidence in the service medical records to provide a negative opinion); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (lack of contemporaneous medical records does not, in and of itself, render lay testimony not credible. As a finder of fact, though, the Board may weigh the absence of contemporaneous records when assessing the credibility of the lay evidence). In other words, the absence of treatment or symptoms is not necessarily fatal to the claim for service connection. Because the negative nexus opinion is based on a lack of medical documentation while in service, the opinion is inadequate. It therefore has no probative value in this case.

The only other evidence regarding etiology or onset is the Veteran's statements of symptom onset and continuity. As noted above, the Veteran reported in his March 2023 Statement in Support of Claim that his tinnitus began during basic training in 1965. He stated, during his VA examination, that the course of his tinnitus has been constant bilateral ringing. 

Next, the Veteran submitted a January 2025 Statement in Support of Claim clarifying his remarks made during his August 2024 examination. The Veteran stated that when the VA examiner asked him about the onset of his tinnitus, the examiner asked him, "Would you guess about 30 years ago?" The Veteran stated he was nervous and replied, "Yeah, something like that." 

The Veteran specifically described, in his clarification statement, that his tinnitus began while he was in basic training during weapons qualifications with the M-14 as well as "Infiltration Course" training. The Veteran reported that during these trainings there was live fire and explosive device detonations. The Veteran conceded that he sometimes wore protective hearing during weapons qualifications, but that trainees would at times have to take them out to hear instructions. He also stated he believed the ear protection was not sufficient for the level of noise he was exposed to. The Veteran stated that during "Infiltration Course" training, while explosive devices were detonated and weapons were fired, no ear protection was worn. The Veteran stated that it was during these trainings that he would experience loud ringing in his ears at night while trying to go to sleep. 

The Board finds the Veteran's March 2023 Statement in Support of claim, statements made during his August 2024 medical examination, and January 2025 clarification to be competent, consistent, specific, and therefore credible. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994) (holding that a lay witness is competent to testify to that which the witness has actually observed and is within the realm of his personal knowledge). The Board finds particularly persuasive the fact the Veteran conceded he wore ear protection during weapons qualification training, despite such a detail weighing against his interest. 

Accordingly, as the sole probative evidence in this case demonstrates that the Veteran's tinnitus was incurred in service, the Board finds service connection is warranted based on the evidence of record at this time. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. In so reaching that conclusion, the Board has appropriately applied the benefit of the doubt doctrine in this case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Bilateral Hearing Loss

For purposes of applying VA laws, impaired hearing is considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran asserts his currently diagnosed hearing loss is etiologically related to service. As noted above, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran had in-service noise exposure. Likewise, the Veteran's audiometric data from the August 2024 VA audiological examination demonstrates a hearing loss for VA purposes under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, bilaterally. Accordingly, the first two elements have been met in this case and the Board will focus on the third-nexus-element. 

The August 2024 audiological medical examiner provided a negative nexus opinion. The examiner opined that because there were no significant threshold shifts in hearing at separation, and because the Veteran reported that the onset of his hearing loss was thirty years after separation, it was less likely than not that the Veteran's hearing loss is etiologically related to the Veteran's military service. The medical examiner, again, did not referenced the Veteran's March 2023 Statement in Support of Claim, nor did they reference other reports made in prior VA hearing medical examinations. 

Notably, the Veteran does not have to show diagnosed hearing loss or significant auditory threshold shifts at the time of discharge in order to establish service connection. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993); see also Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). Moreover, the essence of the proffered opinion is essentially the lack of any documented hearing loss in service or during the one-year period post-discharge. Though the examiner referenced the Veteran's conceded loud noise exposure, the examiner did not fully address all of the Veteran's reports of onset and continuity of symptomatology. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23; see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (holding a medical opinion must contain clear conclusions with supporting data, and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two). Therefore, this opinion is inadequate and has very low probative value.

The other evidence of record indicates the Veteran reported his hearing issues began during basic training after exposure to helicopter noise, weapons qualification training, exposure to C-130 noise, explosive detonation, and live weapons fire. See February 2024 Statement in Support of Claim. The Veteran further reported that he has suffered from these hearing issues "ever since." The Board finds the Veteran's statements to be competent and credible with regards to onset of symptoms during service and their continuity until the present, and lends them a significant amount of probative value.

In weighing the Veteran's lay statements against the VA examiner's opinion in this case, the Board finds the evidence to be in approximate equal balance. Accordingly, the Board resolves any doubt in this case and finds that the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss began in service and has been continuous since onset. Accordingly, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted in this case based on the evidence of record and considerable in this appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. In so reaching that conclusion, the Board has appropriately applied the benefit of the doubt doctrine in this case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
