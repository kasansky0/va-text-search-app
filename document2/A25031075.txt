ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea syndrome is dismissed.

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for hypertension is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At the time the Veteran submitted his February 1, 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), selecting the Hearing option, concerning the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea syndrome, the Veteran had already submitted a December 14, 2020, VA Form 10182 NOD, which was pending at the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) for the same issue.

2. At the time the Veteran submitted his February 1, 2021, VA Form 10182 NOD, selecting the Hearing option, concerning the issue of entitlement to service connection for hypertension, the Veteran had already submitted a December 14, 2020, VA Form 10182 NOD, which was pending at the Board for the same issue.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal seeking service connection for sleep apnea syndrome have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. 

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal seeking service connection for hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1982 to March 1986. The Board thanks the Veteran for his service to our country. 

This matter was docketed at the Board in response to the Veteran's February 2021 VA Form 10182 NOD, under the Hearing option; this was an attempt to appeal a January 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, known as the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

A hearing was scheduled for April 1, 2025, but was cancelled (with notice provided to the Veteran and his representative) because, as discussed below, concurrent adjudication of a claim is specifically prohibited by 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). See March 2025 VA Form 27-0820. 

The Board seeks to make clear that the Veteran currently has two appeals docketed at the Board for the same issues: one arising from a December 2020 VA Form 10182 NOD and another arising from a February 2021 VA Form 10182 NOD. The Board here dismisses only the appeal arising from the February 2021 VA Form 10182 NOD, while the appeal arising from the December 2020 VA Form 10182 NOD remains pending at the Board under docket number 201214-126850 and will be addressed by the Board in a separate decision at a later date.

1. The appeal for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea syndrome is dismissed.

2. The appeal for entitlement to service connection for hypertension is dismissed.

After the AOJ adjudicates a Veteran's claim, the Veteran has one year to file a request for a higher-level review (HLR), supplemental claim, or review by the Board. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. Once a claimant has filed one of these review options, the claimant may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file a request for another review option with respect to the same claim, or same issue contained within the claim, until the HLR, supplemental claim, or appeal to the Board is adjudicated or withdrawn. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); see also Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110, 1134 (Fed. Cir. 2021) ("[38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b)] prohibits claimants from pursuing two concurrent lanes of administrative review for the same 'claim or issue'"). More recently, in Terry v. McDonough, the Court emphasized that concurrent elections are prohibited. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option." 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). Accordingly, the Court's holding in Terry makes it perfectly clear that only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue. Id.

In this case, a November 2020 AOJ rating decision denied service connection for sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension. Subsequently, the Veteran submitted a December 14, 2020, VA Form 10182 NOD, appealing the issues through disagreement with the November 2020 rating decision. The December 2020 NOD elected the Hearing option and presented these issues for appellate review by the Board.

While the December 2020 appeal was pending at the Board, the AOJ readjudicated the claimed conditions on its own initiative and issued a January 2021 rating decision, again denying service connection for sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension. The Veteran then filed a new VA Form 10182 NOD in February 2021, selecting the Hearing option and presenting the same issues for appellate review by the Board, but this time on the basis of appealing the January 2021 rating decision.

However, as the Veteran had already filed a VA Form 10182 for the same issues, the February 2021 VA Form 10182 NOD is considered duplicative and an impermissible concurrent election under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. Given the foregoing, the Board is prevented from construing the February 2021 VA Form 10182 NOD as requesting review of the denials of service connection for sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension, as addressed in the January 2021 rating decision.

The Board also acknowledges the notice provisions regarding a jurisdictional defect under 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c) but does not find that this is for application here. It is unequivocal that the December 2020 VA Form 10182 NOD was still pending in appellate status at the Board at the time the February 2021 VA Form 10182 NOD was submitted. Accordingly, applying the notice provision would serve no useful purpose and there is no indication that the additional delay to do so would actually avail the Veteran of any benefit. Therefore, the appeals for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension, arising from the February 2021 VA Form 10182 NOD, are dismissed.
