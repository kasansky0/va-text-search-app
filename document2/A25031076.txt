Entitlement to a rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for right foot hallux valgus is granted, subject to the applicable regulations concerning the payment of monetary benefits.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. From January 31, 2024, the most persuasive evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran experienced severe postoperative residuals, such as incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps or recent amputations, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, or the necessity for house confinement, or the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches, or that his service-connected left foot disability required immobilization by a cast.

2. From September 30, 2023, the most persuasive evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran experienced severe postoperative residuals, such as incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps or recent amputations, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, or the necessity for house confinement, or the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches, or that his service-connected right foot disability required immobilization by a cast.

3. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected left foot hallux valgus more nearly approximated a severe foot injury.

4. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected right foot hallux valgus more nearly approximated a severe foot injury.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an extension of a temporary 100 percent rating beyond January 31, 2024 (and prior to the October 12, 2023, foot surgery) based on surgical or other treatment necessitating convalescence for a foot disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.30, 4.71A.

2. The criteria for an extension of a temporary 100 percent rating beyond September 30, 2023 (and prior to the May 11, 2023, foot surgery) based on surgical or other treatment necessitating convalescence for a right knee disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.30, 4.71A.

3. Throughout the period on appeal, the criteria for a 30 percent disability rating, but no higher, for the Veteran's left foot disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.27, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5284.

4. Throughout the period on appeal, the criteria for a 30 percent disability rating, but no higher, for the Veteran's right foot disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.27, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5284.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1993 to November 2000.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September and October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an extension of a temporary evaluation in excess of 100 percent, from October 12, 2023, to January 31, 2024.

2. Entitlement to an extension of a temporary evaluation in excess of 100 percent, from May 11, 2023, to September 30, 2023.

On October 12, 2023, the Veteran underwent a left foot bunionectomy with first metatarsal osteotomy, hammertoe correction 2nd/3rd/4th digits, arthrodesis of 2nd/3rd/4th digits. In the October 2023 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran was awarded a temporary 100 percent rating based on the need for convalescence from October 12, 2023, to January 31, 2024.  On May 11, 2023, the Veteran underwent a right foot HEV bunion correction by double metatarsal osteotomy.  In the September 2023 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran was awarded a temporary 100 percent rating based on the need for convalescence from May 11, 2023 to October 1, 2023.  The Veteran contends an extension of the temporary total rating is warranted.

A total rating (100 percent) for convalescence will be assigned following hospital discharge, effective from the date of hospital admission or outpatient treatment and continuing for a period of 1, 2, or 3 months from the first day of the month following such hospital discharge or outpatient release, if the hospital treatment of the service-connected disability resulted in: (1) surgery necessitating at least one month of convalescence; (2) surgery with severe postoperative residuals such as incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps or recent amputations, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, or the necessity for house confinement, or the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches (regular weight bearing prohibited); or (3) immobilization by cast, without surgery, of one major joint or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.30.  Extensions of 1, 2, or 3 months beyond the initial 3 months may be made for a total of 6 months.  38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (b)(1).  Extensions of 1 or more months up to 6 months beyond this initial 6-month period may be made upon a determination that there still exist severe postoperative residuals under Section 4.30(a)(2) or immobilization by cast under Section 4.30(a)(3). 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (b)(2).  Following the temporary total disability rating, the disability will be rated by the appropriate schedular evaluation.  38 C.F.R. § 4.30.

The Court has held that convalescence is "the stage of recovery following an attack of disease, a surgical operation, or an injury," and recovery is "the act of regaining or returning toward a normal or healthy state."  Felden v. West, 11 Vet. App. 427, 430 (1998).  The Felden decision additionally held that a veteran's incapacity to work after surgery must be taken into account in the evaluation of a claim brought under 38 C.F.R. § 4.30.

Analysis

Based on the evidence, the Board concludes the evidence does not warrant an extension of the Veteran's convalescence rating beyond February 1, 2024, in the first instance, or October 1, 2023, in the second instance. 

After careful review, there is no persuasive evidence indicating that the Veteran experienced severe postoperative residuals, such as incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps or recent amputations, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, or the necessity for house confinement, or the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches, or that his service-connected disability required immobilization by a cast in the months or years immediately following the expiration of his first temporary total rating for knee surgery. 

The Veteran has not provided specific or persuasive evidence that he experienced severe postoperative residuals beyond February 1, 2024, in the first instance, or October 1, 2023, in the second instance.

For these reasons, the Board finds the persuasive evidence of record is against an extension of the temporary total rating beyond February 1, 2024, in the first instance, or October 1, 2023, in the second instance, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.30.  To this extent, the claim is denied.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left foot hallux valgus.

4. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right foot hallux valgus.

The Veteran asserts that increased disability ratings are warranted for service-connected bilateral foot disabilities. The Veteran is currently assigned a 10 percent disability rating for each foot pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5280, in addition to a 10 percent rating for metatarsalgia pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5279.

Under Diagnostic Code 5280, a maximum 10 percent rating is warranted for unilateral, severe hallux valgus, if equivalent to amputation of great toe. A maximum 10 percent rating is also warranted for unilateral hallux valgus operated with resection of metatarsal head. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5280.

The assignment of a particular diagnostic code depends upon the facts of each particular case, and the Board is authorized to choose an appropriate diagnostic code that is supported by both the evidence of record and a sufficiently articulated rationale.  See Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538-39 (1993).  Moreover, service connection for a disability is not severed when the diagnostic code assigned to that disability is revised in order to more accurately reflect the veteran's relevant medical history, diagnoses, and demonstrated symptomatology.  See Read v. Shinseki, 651 F.3d 1296, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2011).

As flatfoot, weak foot, claw foot (pes cavus), and malunion or nonunion of the tarsal or metatarsal bones have not been shown, Diagnostic Codes 5276, 5277, 5278, 5281, and 5283 are not for application. Diagnostic Code 5281, pertaining to hallux rigidus, directs that such should be rated as hallux valgus, severe under Diagnostic 5280.  The Veteran is already rated under Diagnostic Code 5279 for metatarsalgia.

Diagnostic Code 5284 applies to non-specified feet disabilities and provides for a 10 percent rating for a moderate injury, a 20 percent rating for a moderately severe injury, and a 30 percent rating for a severe injury. A 40 percent rating is assigned for actual loss of use of foot. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Descriptive words such as "moderate" and "severe," as used in the various diagnostic codes, are not defined in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to ensure that its decisions are "equitable and just as contemplated by the requirements of the law."  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), however, has provided some guidance in regard to what would warrant a "severe" evaluation under Diagnostic Code 5284.  In Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307 (2015), the Court noted that the word "severe" as used in Diagnostic Code 5284 is not defined in the pertinent regulation, and that, "[i]n the absence of an express definition, words are given their ordinary meaning." Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 310 (2015).  The Court noted that "[t]he ordinary meaning of 'severe' is 'very great [or] intense,'... or 'of a great degree,'" and that it was used in Diagnostic Code 5284 "to indicate a very great or intense case of the specific listed disability, in order to differentiate between lesser (or sometimes greater) cases of that same disability within the specific diagnostic code."  Id. 

The Board additionally notes that when evaluating joint disabilities rated on the basis of limitation of motion, VA must consider granting a higher rating in cases in which functional loss due to pain, weakness, excess fatigability, or incoordination is demonstrated, and those factors are not contemplated in the relevant rating criteria.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  The Court has clarified that although pain may be a cause or manifestation of functional loss, limitation of motion due to pain is not necessarily rated at the same level as functional loss where motion is impeded.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).

Instead, the Mitchell Court explained that pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45, the possible manifestations of functional loss include decreased or abnormal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, or endurance, as well as less or more movement than is normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, and pain on movement (as well as swelling, deformity, and atrophy) that affects stability, standing, and weight-bearing. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45; Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).  Thus, functional loss caused by pain must be rated at the same level as if the functional loss were caused by any of the other factors cited above.  Therefore, in evaluating the severity of a joint disability, VA must determine the overall functional impairment due to these factors.

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, which relate to painful motion, are not limited to arthritis and must be considered when raised by the claimant or when reasonably raised by the record. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).  Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in Southall-Norman v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 346, 352 (2016) held that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, which relate to painful motion, are not limited to the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities under Diagnostic Codes predicated on range of motion measurements.

In Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011), the Court held that 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. Furthermore, in Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 61-63 (2012) the Court held that the Board may not deny entitlement to an increased rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are specifically contemplated by the rating criteria.  Lastly, in Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021), it was held that ankylosis may be shown based on symptoms of fixation of the joint equivalent to ankylosis.

Analysis

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran was afforded a VA foot examination in December 2020.  At that time, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with hallux valgus of both feet dating from 1992, in addition to metatarsalgia dating from 2020.  The Veteran reported a history of foot pain beginning in 1993 that has continued since that time.  The Veteran noted that the issues began while in the military and his socks would become twisted inside his boots.  This twisting of socks caused callouses to form on the balls of his feet and pain was noted in this area. He also noted that his overlapping toes (second toe over big toe bilaterally) caused callouses to develop on second toe.  The Veteran reported that his foot pain has progressively worsened, as he experienced increased pain and limited functionality on a daily basis.  The Veteran noted that it is painful to walk or stand for long periods.  The Veteran's job is primarily sitting, but with the walking required on his job he is limping by the end of the day.  The pain on the balls of his feet causes him to walk on his heels or the outer surfaces of his feet.  The feet swell by the end of the day, and they are painful to touch.  The Veteran reported a sharp, shooting pain on the ball of his feet and on the calloused area of his second toes.  

The Veteran reported flare-ups when he is on his feet too much, when he experiences extreme pain, swelling, and is forced to limp.  The Veteran's only relief at these times is taking Ibuprofen and propping up his feet.  The examiner also reported that, in addition to the problems previously described, the Veteran had moderate foot injuries affecting both feet that chronically compromised weight bearing and required arch supports, custom orthotic inserts, or shoe modifications.  The Veteran's foot injuries were characterized as overlapping toes on both feet, where the second toe overlaps the big toe bilaterally.  The examiner noted that the Veteran experienced pain in both feet, and that this pain contributed to functional loss.  The Veteran's functional loss was characterized by pain on weight bearing, disturbance of locomotion, interference with standing, and pain noted with standing or walking for long periods of time.  The examiner reported that the Veteran has pain and limps after being on his feet for long periods of time.  The Veteran noted he is limited to only sedentary work by his foot conditions.

The Veteran was afforded an additional VA examination in September 2022.  The Veteran was again diagnosed with bilateral hallux valgus and bilateral metatarsalgia.  The examiner reported that the Veteran had sharp foot pain, and that there were no flare-ups of either foot.  The Veteran reported that he could not stand or walk for extended periods of time without 10/10 pain.  The examiner noted that the following factors contributed to the Veteran's foot disabilities: weakened movement and pain in both feet.  The examiner noted that there was evidence of pain on passive motion, active motion, weight-bearing, nonweight-bearing, and on rest/non-movement, of both feet.  The examiner reported that the Veteran ambulated only with the constant use of a cane.  The Veteran was reported to work at a metal recycling yard that required him to walk and stand for long periods of time on both flat and uneven ground for ten hours daily.

According to VA treatment records, on May 11, 2023, the Veteran underwent right foot HEV bunion correction by double metatarsal osteotomy.  The distal metatarsal osteotomy fixated with a K-wire and the metatarsal base wedge was fixated with two partially threaded screws.  Hammertoe correction of digits 2, 3, and 4, occurred, and the toes were fixated with PIPJ and DIPJ fusions.

According to VA treatment records, on October 12, 2023, the Veteran underwent a left bunionectomy with 1st metatarsal osteotomy, hammertoe correction 2nd/3rd/4th digits, arthrodesis of 2nd/3rd/4th digits.  The findings included interval correction of left bunion deformity and hammertoe deformities 2-3, and that the paragon tap instrument had broken in the 4th digit and could not be removed, which was confirmed under fluoroscopy.  The Veteran was discharged with an acute level of care required post-operation.

Post-service treatment records note ongoing complaints of bilateral foot pain.

After a review of the above, and resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that Veteran's left and right foot hallux valgus and metatarsalgia has manifested in severe symptoms throughout the period on appeal to warrant 30 percent disability ratings pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5284.  Specifically, the Board has considered the functional impairments caused by the Veteran's disabilities which include impairment in both daily and occupational tasks due to decreased endurance.  The Board also notes the Veteran's consistent reports of severe pain and the surgery performed on each foot to correct the Veteran's foot deformities.  Significantly, the December 2020 VA examiner opined that the Veteran had moderate foot injuries, and this was prior to the Veteran's worsening foot conditions and eventual surgeries.

The Veteran has not contended, and the evidence does not otherwise reflect, that the Veteran has completely lost all functional use of the feet, with no effective function remaining other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation stump with a suitable prosthetic appliance.  This finding was specifically made during the VA examinations of record and evidenced by the Veteran's continued ability to ambulate.  Thus, a higher rating of 40 percent under Diagnostic Code 5284 for loss of use of the foot is also not warranted for the Veteran's disability.

In sum, the Veteran's service-connected left and right foot hallux valgus have resulted in severe impairments that most closely approximate the criteria for a 30 percent disability rating, but no higher, under Diagnostic Code 5284 during the entire period on appeal. To this extent, the claims are granted.
