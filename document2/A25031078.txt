Entitlement to an increased rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with gastritis from January 16, 2024, is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for bronchitis is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Prior to January 16, 2024, the Veteran's GERD manifested to reflux, mild epigastric discomfort and occasional substernal chest pain.  

2. From January 16, 2024, the Veteran's GERD has manifested to persistent epigastric distress, pyrosis, reflux, substernal pain, and occasional regurgitation.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an increased initial rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with gastritis prior to January 16, 2024, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159, 4.1, 4.7, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346.  

2. The criteria for an increased rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with gastritis from January 16, 2024, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159, 4.1, 4.7, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Army from November 20, 1984, to June 22, 1990.  The Veteran had an additional period of service from June 23, 1990, to October 4, 1996, which was deemed dishonorable for VA purposes pursuant to a VA administrative decision, which was received into the record in September 2015.

In June 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision for his increased rating claim for GERD, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, and the January 2024 decision for his claim of entitlement to service connection for bronchitis.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for bronchitis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The Board determines the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his/her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, and the assigned rating is based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairment of earning capacity in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.10 (2018).  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings should be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  However, the evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

Additionally, when an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  In a claim for a greater original rating after an initial award of service connection, all of the evidence submitted in support of the veteran's claim is to be considered.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 4.2.  However, consideration must be given as to whether staged ratings should be assigned to reflect entitlement to a higher rating at any point during the pendency of the claim.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

1. Entitlement to an Increased Rating: GERD

The Veteran's service-connected gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) with gastritis is rated as non-compensable prior to January 16, 2024, and as 10 percent disabling thereafter under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7346 of the Schedule Ratings for the Digestive System.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346. 

Under DC 7346, a 10 percent rating is warranted when there are two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), pyrosis (heartburn), and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, causing considerable impairment of health.  A 60 percent rating is assigned for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  Id.

The Board notes that the Schedule Ratings for the Digestive System, to include DC 7346, were amended effective May 19, 2024.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 19735 (March 20, 2024).  However, since the current claim was pending as of the February 2024 rating decision, the amended criteria does not apply.  

In September 2014, the Veteran attended a VA examination.  The Veteran reported onset of sharp epigastric discomfort with occasional substernal chest pain and reflux of gastric contents.  He reported being on omeprazole for many years and it provided good relief.  He also used simethicone for gas symptoms.  The Veteran's symptoms due to his GERD symptoms was reflux.  

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a private examination.  The Veteran reported he suffers from acid reflux, chest pain, heartburn, burning sensation in his throat, and regurgitation.  He did take continuous medication for his condition of omeprazole daily and Tums or Pepto Bismol two to three times a week for acid reflux as needed. 

In February 2024, the Veteran attended VA examinations for GERD and stomach conditions.  The Veteran reported heart burn, acid reflux, and chest pain.  His treatment plan included continuous use of omeprazole.  His symptoms were persistently recurrent epigastric distress, pyrosis, reflux, substernal pain, and nausea that occurs 4 or more times a year and lasts less than 1 day.  In the Veteran's stomach condition examination for gastritis, the Veteran's symptoms were noted as recurring episodes of symptoms that are not severe and occur 4 or more times a year and last less than 1 day, and transient nausea that occurs 4 or more times a year and lasts less than one day.  The Veteran did not have any incapacitating episodes due to his stomach condition.  There were no other pertinent findings. 

The Board notes there are minimal VA treatment visits and private medical records for his GERD condition.  In February 2012, he was seen at his private medical provider.  He reported abdominal pain and was noted as having mild epigastric pain, pain in his chest, and gas.  He was documented as having dyspepsia and gastritis.  The Veteran was taking omeprazole for his condition. 

After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that a 10 percent rating, but no higher, prior to January 16, 2024, is warranted.  The evidence of record shows the Veteran reported reflux, epigastric discomfort and occasional substernal pain.  Thus, the Board finds a rating of 10 percent, but no higher, is warranted for this period.  However, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to January 16, 2024, is not warranted.  The Veteran's condition during this period was noted as mild.  Further, while the Veteran reported reflux, discomfort, and occasional substernal pain, the February 2014 examiner also noted the Veteran's official symptoms as only being reflux.  The Veteran further was not found to have pyrosis, regurgitation, or vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of considerable or severe impairment of health.  Therefore, ratings of 30 percent of 60 percent are not warranted. 

The Board does finds that a rating of 30 percent, but no higher, from January 16, 2024, is warranted.  The Veteran's condition was noted as causing persistent epigastric distress, reflux, pyrosis, nausea, substernal pain, and continuous use of medications.  The Veteran also reported regurgitation in his January 2024 private examination.  Therefore, the Board finds that the overall severity of his condition is more considerable and rises to the level to warrant a 30 percent rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346.

However, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted for this period.  The Veteran at no time has been found to have material weight loss, hematemesis, or melena with moderate anemia nor has the Veteran reported such symptoms or conditions.  The Board recognizes that the Veteran reported pain; however, the evidence has not shown symptoms of material weight loss, anemia, pain in his shoulder or arm, nor has he reported any vomiting.  Lastly, his symptoms were not documented as causing severe impairment of his health.  Thus, the overall severity of his condition has not risen to the level to warrant a rating of 60 percent from January 16, 2024.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346.

The Board notes that the Veteran has been provided ratings under Diagnostic Code 7346 for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), as it is the diagnostic code that provides the Veteran with the highest possible rating.  Consideration under DC 7307 for Gastritis would not provide the Veteran with a compensable rating, as the Veteran has not been found to have chronic nodular lesions, ulcerated areas, or severe hemorrhages.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7307.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertions that he is entitled to a higher rating because his symptoms are worse.  The Board recognizes that lay persons are competent to report observations with regard to the severity of symptomatology.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, the Board has reviewed the evidence of record and finds it is consistent with the ratings herein assigned. 

In light of the foregoing, the Board concludes a rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's GERD prior to January 16, 2024, and a rating of 30 percent, but no higher, thereafter are warranted.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine has been applied.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Although the Board regrets further delay, remand is required prior to adjudication of the Veteran's remaining claim. 

Entitlement to Service Connection: Bronchitis 

The issue is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the January 2024 rating decision on appeal.  

The Board finds the January 2024 VA opinion is inadequate to fairly adjudicate the claim.  First, the examiner opined that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis.  However, a September 2023 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with chronic bronchitis, and this diagnosis was not considered by the January 2024 examiner.  Further, while private medical records note acute bronchitis, the record shows multiple notations of acute bronchitis in January 2016, March 2017, and January 2019, which suggests a chronic problem.  Additionally, the Veteran's January 2019 visit with his private physician noted the Veteran was coughing up blood, further suggesting a more severe condition.  The Board reminds the Regional Office that the Court has previously held that the requirement that a claimant have a current disability before service connection may be awarded for that disability is also satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim, even if no disability is present at the time of the claim's adjudication.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).  The Board finds that as the September 2023 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with chronic bronchitis, the Veteran satisfies the requirement of having a disability at any time during the pendency of the appeal.  Lastly, the examiner did not provide any opinion on whether his condition was related to his first honorable period of service, to include his position as a cook exposed to cooking fumes, and gun infantry being exposed to gun powder. 

Thus, the Board finds that a remand is required in order to obtain a new opinion addressing the etiology of the claimed condition. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Send the claim files to an appropriate examiner to determine the etiology of the Veteran's bronchitis condition.  The record and a copy of this Remand must be made available to the examiner

Following a review of the entire record, to include the Veteran's lay statements concerning any in-service symptoms, the examiner should opine is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's chronic bronchitis had its onset during, or is otherwise related to, his active-duty service, to include his position as a cook being exposed to fumes, and position as a gunner exposed to gun powder during his honorable first period of service. 

In offering any opinion, the examiner must consider the full record, to include the lay statements regarding in-service incurrence, and the opinion should reflect such consideration.  A clearly stated rationale for any opinion offered should be provided and must not be based solely on the lack of any in-service records. 

If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she should explain whether the inability is due to the limits of the examiner's medical knowledge, medical knowledge in general or there is evidence that, if obtained, would permit the opinion to be provided.
