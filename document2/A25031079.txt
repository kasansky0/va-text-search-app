ORDER

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on aid and attendance/housebound is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service-connected disability does not result in the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet or one hand and one foot, or blindness in both eyes, or render him permanently bedridden or so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance/housebound are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114 (1), 5103(a), 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350, 3.352(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from April 1974 to March  1976.

In May 2024, the Veteran filed a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) describing a disagreement with the April 2024 rating decision that denied SMC based on aid and attendance/housebound.

In the VA Form 10182, the Veteran selected the Direct Review Docket and, as a result, the Board may only consider the evidence before the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of the April 2024 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301.

Entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance/housebound is denied.

The Veteran generally contends that he is entitled to SMC based on aid and attendance/housebound. See VA Form 10182, dated May 2024.

Applicable Law

SMC at the aid and attendance rate is payable to a claimant who, as a result of their service-connected disabilities establishes a factual need for aid and attendance under the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a). See 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b)(3). Section 3.352(a) provides that the following criteria will be considered in determining whether the claimant is in need of the regular aid and attendance of another person: (1) the inability of the claimant to dress or undress themselves, or to keep themselves ordinarily clean and presentable; (2) frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which, by reason of the particular disability, cannot be done without such aid; (3) the inability of the claimant to feed themselves through the loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; (4) the inability to attend to the wants of nature; or (5) an incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from the hazards or dangers incident to his daily environment.

If a claimant is "bedridden," this will be a proper basis for the determination. For the purpose of this paragraph "bedridden" will be that condition which, through its essential character, actually requires that the claimant remain in bed. The fact that claimant has voluntarily taken to bed or that a physician has prescribed rest in bed for the greater or lesser part of the day to promote convalescence or cure will not suffice. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).

SMC at the housebound rate is payable where a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent, and, in addition has either: (1) a service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or, (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

The permanently housebound criteria are met when a veteran is substantially confined as a result of his or her service-connected disabilities to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or, if institutionalized, to the ward or clinical areas, and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). 

It is not required that all of the above disabling conditions be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. The particular personal functions that a claimant is unable to perform should be considered in connection with their condition as a whole. It is only necessary that the evidence establish that a claimant is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there is a constant need. Determinations that a claimant is so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance will not be based solely upon an opinion that their condition is such as would require them to be in bed. They must be based on the actual requirement of personal assistance from others. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).

Analysis

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted an Examination for Household Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance (VA Form 21-2680). In the diagnosis section it stated he had "R hip disarticulation (20128) (Hx osteomyelitis) OA hip/knee." As to gait, it noted he was not ambulatory and in a wheelchair, and that a loss of limb restricts his him. It noted that his nutrition was "appropriate," he could feed himself and prepare his own meals, but that he needed assistance getting in and out of the tub. The examiner found he did not need nursing care and his posture and general appearance were "appropriate." In response to the question of how often he can leave his home, the examiner stated "as the patient needs."

At the time of the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran was only service-connected for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at a 70 percent rating. See Rating decision Codesheet, April 2024. 

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l), a veteran is eligible for SMC for the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet, loss of one hand and one foot, blindness in both eyes, and/or being permanently bedridden as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l). The Veteran is not service-connected for the loss of either foot or hand, any eye disability, and he does not allege, nor does the record indicate, that he is permanently bedridden. As such, these criteria of entitlement will not be addressed further herein.

A. SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l), So Helpless as to Be in Need of Regular Aid and Attendance

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l), a veteran is afforded SMC if the veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, is with such significant disabilities as to be in need of regular aid and attendance. 

First and foremost, there is no evidence supporting that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD (his only service-connected disability) caused him to be in need of regular aid and attendance. Moreover, the November 2023 VA Form 21-2680 does not support the claim as it does not even reference the Veteran's only service-connected disability of PTSD, and instead deals with the loss of a limb, which is not service-connected. Further, Social Work Notes, dated August 24, 2023, October 18, 2023, and November 8, 2023, show that the "Veteran was alert and oriented x4.  Veteran's mood and behavior were congruent with appearance." A May 2023 PTSD examination found the Veteran's appearance, dress, hygiene, all "Good".  

The Board finds the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD results in the need of regular aid and attendance. As such, SMC for being with such significant disabilities as to be in need of regular aid and attendance is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350, 3.352.

B. SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), Housebound

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), a claimant is afforded SMC where they have a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent, and, in addition has either: (1) a service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or, (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

The Veteran is not entitled to service connection for a single disability rated as total. As such, pathway (1) as detailed above is not applicable in this case.

As to whether the Veteran is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities, the evidence shows the Veteran is able to leave his home as needed and there is no evidence that the Veteran is confined to his home or unable to leave. See VA Form 21-2680, dated November 2023. Further, in the May 2023 PTSD examination the Veteran said "I go to the river for hours and sit there." Thus, the evidence does not show the Veteran is permanently housebound. As such, SMC for being permanently housebound is not warranted.

Accordingly, SMC based on the need for aid and attendance of another person or on account of being housebound is not warranted. In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. The evidence fails to persuasively support the Veteran's claims regarding SMC. As such, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and his claims must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
