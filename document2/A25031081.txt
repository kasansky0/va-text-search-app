REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran, who is the appellant and moving party in this case, served on active duty from September 1954 to December 1975.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

By way of background, a March 2023 rating decision granted higher ratings for the Veteran's right knee and bilateral upper extremity disabilities and granted service connection for kidney disease.  In May 2023, the RO received the Veteran's supplemental claim seeking a higher level of SMC.  A June 2023 rating decision granted 38 U.S.C. 1114(p), effective December 23, 2022, which was the date of the claim.  In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a Higher Level Review (HLR) request, and a rating decision that month denied the claim.  In August 2023, the Veteran filed the present CUE motion that also included continued pursuit of a higher level of SMC.  See August 2023 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim; August 2023 brief from the Veteran's attorney.  A September 2023 rating decision denied the CUE motions and a higher level of SMC.  In the September 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran requested direct review by a Veterans Law Judge.  In September 2023, the Board remanded the matters due to a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  

April 2024 rating decisions continued the current rates of SMC and denied the CUE motions.  In April 2024, the Veteran filed another NOD to appeal the matters directly to the Board and then later that same month he filed a HLR request.  In May 2024, he withdrew the April 2024 NOD in favor of having the matters reviewed under HLR.  In September 2024, the Board dismissed the appeal due to the withdrawn NOD.  A May 2024 rating decision noted that there was duty to assist error concerning the higher level of SMC claims and a rating decision that same month processed and adjudicated the claim under the supplemental claims process.  The RO continued to deny the claims.  In May 2024, the Veteran requested higher level review of the May 2024 decision.  In June 2024, the RO again identified a pre-decisional duty to assist error and a September 2024 rating decision readjudicated the claim.  A September 2024 Board decision dismissed the appeal that stemmed from the earlier NOD because the Veteran had withdrawn the NOD.  In September 2024, the Veteran requested higher level review of the May 2024 rating decision, and a September 2024 HLR rating decision continued to deny the matters on appeal.  In September 20204, he filed an NOD in response to the September 2024 rating decision, and he selected direct review by the Board without submitting any additional evidence or having a hearing.  In December 2024, he waived his right to change the docket to one that allowed additional evidence of a hearing.  

1. The appeal to revise or reverse the October 6, 2005 rating decision, based on CUE, that did not adjudicate the issue of entitlement to SMC based on the loss of use of both feet is remanded.

2. The appeal to revise or reverse the September 14, 2007 rating decision, based on CUE, that did not adjudicate the issue of entitlement to SMC based on the loss of use of both feet is remanded.

3. The appeal to revise or reverse the September 14, 2007 rating decision, based on CUE, that awarded SMC under 38 U.S.C. 1114(l) based on the Veteran's need for regular aid and attendance (A&A) of another due to his service-connected disabilities, and did not limit this award of SMC to being solely based on individual service-connected disabilities is remanded.

4. Entitlement to a higher level of SMC, to include additional awards under 38 U.S.C. 1114(l) based on an individual service-connected disability, and higher levels under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (o) and (m), is remanded.

5. Entitlement to a higher level of SMSC under 38 U.S.C. 1114(r)(2) is remanded.

In November 2023, the Board remanded the matters, in part, to obtain the Veteran's PTSD treatment records at the Memphis Vet Center, as these are Federal records constructively of record that were not associated with the claims file.  The Board notes that the RO subsequently found that this duty to assist error continued to exist because the records were not obtained.  In June 2024, the Vet Center records from December 2003 to January 2005 were associated with the record; however, these records were not complete since the Veteran received ongoing treatment beyond January 2005, as evidenced by the August 2024 statement from his provider noted the Veteran had been receiving treatment since December 2003.  

Since the Board's remand request was not satisfactorily completed, the matter must be remanded to obtain complete records.

The Board notes that the pleadings advanced by the Veteran's attorney have also argued that he should have been awarded a separate SMC award under 38 U.S.C. 1114(l) based on his PTSD, but this aspect of his claim has not been adjudicated.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain Memphis Vet Center records since January 2005 and associate them with the record.
