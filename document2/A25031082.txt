CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for balance disorder/vestibular problems have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1991 to August 1995.

In April 2023, the Veteran filed a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), electing the Hearing with a Veterans Law Judge docket.

Withdrawal

A substantive appeal may be withdrawn in writing at any time before the Board promulgates a decision or may be withdrawn on the record at a hearing. 38C.F.R. §20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative. Id.

1. The appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for a balance disorder (also claimed as vestibular problems) is dismissed.

On September 30, 2024, the Veteran's representative submitted a letter stating, "Please accept this letter as formal notification that the above-named claimant wishes to withdraw the following issue(s): 2. Balance Disorder/Vestibular Problems." Accordingly, the Board no longer has appellate jurisdiction and can take no further action on this matter. 38C.F.R. §20.205
