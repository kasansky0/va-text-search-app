DOCKET NO. 210419-217436
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) emergency medical services provided to the Veteran from March 22-25, 2021, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved payment of the cost for the relevant episode of care. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of payment of the cost of non-VA emergency medical services provided on March 22-25, 2021, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot. 38?U.S.C. ยง?7105; 38?C.F.R. ยง?20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In April 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the appellant electing the Direct Review docket to review a prior April 2021 determination issued by a VA AOJ.   

The claim for payment of the cost of non-VA emergency medical care provided to the Veteran on March 22-25, 2021, was then administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  The record reflects that the claim was reprocessed and payment was approved for the relevant episode of care. In a January 2022 letter, the AOJ advised the appellant that the appeal for reimbursement of the cost of medical services had been approved after secondary administrative review. The letter explained that the claim related to this episode of care would be processed according to VA policy.   

The administrative action approving payment for the March 22-25, 2021, episode of care constitutes a reversal of the previous denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal. No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees, and on that basis, the appeal is dismissed. 38?U.S.C. ยง?7105(d).
