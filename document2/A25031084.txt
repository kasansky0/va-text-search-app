REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1983 to March 1987. 

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2023 decision.  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2023 decision.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the June 2023 decision the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Date

In general, the effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

1. An effective date of June 13, 2012, for the assignment of a 40 percent rating for back disability, is granted. 

2. An effective date of June 13, 2012, for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for neck disability, is granted. 

3. An effective date of June 13, 2012, for the grant of service connection for right knee instability, is granted. 

4. An effective date of June 13, 2012, for the grant of service connection for left knee instability, is granted. 

The Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date for the grant of 40 percent rating for back disability, the grant of 20 percent rating for neck disability, as well as the grant of service connection for bilateral knee instability. 

Review of the record shows that the Veteran filed an initial claim for service connection for the back, neck and bilateral knee disabilities on June 29, 2006. He continuously pursued the claim until service connection was granted by the Board in May 2023. In a May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the Board's grant of service connection. Based on this procedural history, the Board finds that the date of claim is June 29, 2006. The remaining question is when entitlement to benefits arose. 

The Veteran's back disability is rated as 40 percent disabling under diagnostic code (DC) 5242-5243. Under this DC, a 40 percent rating is assigned where forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine is present. 

The Veteran's neck disability is assigned a 20 percent rating under DC 5237-5243. Under this DC, a 20 percent rating is assigned, where a forward flexion of the cervical spine is greater than 15 degrees but not greater than 30 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the cervical spine is not greater than 170 degrees; or there is muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  

Reviewing the evidence in light most favorable to the Veteran and affording him the benefit of the doubt, the Board concludes that entitlement for 40 percent rating for back disability, and 20 precent rating for neck disability arose on June 13, 2012. The Veteran submitted a private medical record that reflects that his range of forward flexion of the lumbar spine and cervical spine was limited to 25 degrees during a June 13, 2012 evaluation. His range of motion was unchanged after repetitive use testing. June 13, 2012 is the earliest date that the evidence in the record reflects that the Veteran's back and neck disabilities were manifested by a limitation of range of flexion consistent with 40 percent and 20 percent ratings, respectively.  Therefore, June 13, 2012 is the earliest date the evidence supports an assignment of a 40 percent rating for the back disability and a 20 percent rating for the neck disability. While the record has private treatment records from April 2012 that show that the Veteran complained about pain in the back and neck, the record is devoid of evidence that shows that the Veteran's pain was severe enough to cause functional limitation consistent with 40 and 20 percent ratings, respectively, earlier than June 13, 2012. 

Similarly, the June 13, 2012 evaluation is the first time the evidence showed that the Veteran had bilateral knee instability. The record does not have evidence earlier than this date that shows the presence of bilateral knee instability. Therefore, June 13, 2012 is the earliest date that the evidence establishes that the Veteran's bilateral knee instability manifested. 

Because June 13, 2012 is later than the date VA received the Veteran's claim, it is the appropriate effective date for the grant of 40 percent rating for back disability, 20 percent rating for the neck disability, as well as service connection for right knee instability and left knee instability. Thus, the claims are granted.

5. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 26, 2022, for the grant of 20 percent for right ankle disability, is denied. 

The Veteran is seeking an effective date earlier than December 26, 2022 for the grant of 20 percent rating for right ankle disability. 

Review of the claims file shows that the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for right ankle disability on June 29, 2006. Therefore, the date of claim is June 29, 2006. The remaining question is when entitlement to a 20 percent rating arose. 

The Veteran's right ankle disability is rated at 20 percent under DC 5271. Under DC 5271, a 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle. Standard range of motion of an ankle is 0 to 20 degrees of dorsiflexion and 0 to 45 degrees of plantar flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71 Plate II.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for DC 5271. 85 Fed. Reg. 76,453 (Nov. 30, 2020).  Under the new criteria, a 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion.)  As this regulatory change was enacted during the pendency of this appeal, the Board will consider both the old and new versions of the rating criteria from the effective date and apply the version most favorable to the Veteran.

Prior to February 7, 2021, the schedule of ratings did not provide information as to what manifestations constitute "moderate" or "marked" limitation of ankle motion, but guidance could be found in the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1). The M21-1 states that marked limitation of motion is demonstrated when there is less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion. See M21-1, III.iv.4.A.3.k. The M21-1 is not binding on the Board. However, the Board must address relevant provisions of the M21-1 and conduct an independent analysis before determining whether the provisions may be relied upon as a factor to support its decision. Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257 (2018).

Here, the Board finds the M21-1 provision is relevant and helpful in defining "marked" limitation of motion of the ankle prior to February 7, 2021, and especially persuasive as the definition was adopted into the regulation in the February 2021 revision.

In this case, private treatment records from April 2012 reflect that the Veteran had ankle pain. In June 2012, his range of motion of the right ankle was 35 degrees plantar flexion and 17 degrees dorsiflexion. 

The Veteran underwent a VA evaluation in November 2012, where his initial range of motion was 45 degrees or greater plantar flexion and 20 degrees dorsiflexion or greater. There was no objective evidence of painful motion during this exam. His range of motion was unchanged after repetitive use testing. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's right ankle disability did not impact his ability to work. 

The Veteran was afforded additional evaluation in September 2015, where his initial range of motion was normal. His range of motion was unchanged after repetitive use testing. The Veteran reported that he experiences flare-ups, and the examination was not conducted during such flare-ups. This examination pre-dates Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26, 34-36 (2017); nevertheless, the examiner did not estimate the Veteran's range of motion during flare-ups or after repetitive use overtime. Thus, the September 2015 evaluation is adequate based on the current law but provides no information regarding flare-up limitations. 

A disability benefit questionnaire (DBQ) from December 26, 2022 reflects that the Veteran's range of motion significantly decreased to 5 degrees plantar flexion and 5 degrees dorsiflexion. 

In sum, the Veteran did not have any limitation of motion during the November 2012 examination. To the extent he had some limitation of range of motion in April 2012, he only lost 10 degrees of plantar flexion and 3 degrees of dorsiflexion. As such, the Veteran's range of motion was higher than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or 30 degrees plantar flexion considered as marked limitation of motion under M21-1 terms under the old regulation and explicitly under the revised regulation.. While the September 2015 examination gave no flare-up information, the Veteran's range of motion was normal, suggesting improvement. Applying common sense to this context, it is reasonable to conclude that flare-ups would not produce a drastic result of loss from normal range to less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion. Moreover, there is no affirmative evidence to support a finding of such drastic change in 2015.

Therefore, the evidence does not establish that the Veteran's right ankle disability was manifested by marked limitation of motion under both the old and new rating criteria of DC 5271 prior to December 26, 2022. While the Board understands that the decreased range of motion is unlikely to have happened suddenly on December 26, 2022, the evidence does not pinpoint a date of entitlement prior to this date. Therefore, the Board's legal conclusion is that entitlement to a 20 percent rating for right ankle disability did not arise earlier than December 26, 2022. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether an effective date earlier than December 26, 2022 is warranted for the Veteran's right ankle disability. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The claim is denied.

6. An effective date of June 29, 2006, for the grant of service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy, is granted. 

The Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy. 

The claim regarding the right upper extremity radiculopathy is part and parcel of the claim for neck disability, which was received on June 29, 2006.  Thus, June 29, 2006 is the date of claim. 

During a May 2012 hearing, the Veteran testified that he has had neck pain that radiates down his arm to his fingertips off and on since his military service. See hearing transcript at 43-45. During a November 2012 neck evaluation, the Veteran reported pain that radiates to his shoulders and to the elbow on the right side. During the September 2015 exam, the Veteran had pain on the right side of his neck coming down to the back of his arm to the elbow on the right. 

A December 26, 2022 DBQ reflects that pain that radiates down the right arm is a symptom related to radiculopathy of the right upper extremity. The Board recognizes that the November 2012 and September 2015 VA examiners did not diagnose right upper extremity radiculopathy. However, the Veteran is competent to describe lay observable symptoms, such as pain. His statement that his neck pain started radiating down his arms as early as when he was in the military is found to be credible. Therefore, reviewing the evidence in light most favorable to the Veteran and affording him the benefit of the doubt, the Board concludes that his radiculopathy symptom first manifested earlier than the June 29, 2006 date of claim.  See Taylor v. Collins, No. 24-5043, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 240, at *1 (Vet. App. Feb. 26, 2025) (finding when assigning an effective date based on when entitlement arose, the Board may not mechanically assign the date of an exam but must determine when the disability first manifested.) 

Because the evidence is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's radiculopathy symptoms first manifested earlier than June 29, 2006, the date of claim is later than the date entitlement arose. Therefore, the Board finds that June 29, 2006 is the appropriate effective date for the grant of service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy. The claim is granted. 

7. An effective date of November 13, 2012, for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy affecting the sciatic nerve, is granted. 

8. An effective date of November 13, 2012, for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy affecting the femoral nerve, is granted. 

The Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy affecting the sciatic nerve, and femoral nerve.  

As indicated above, the Veteran filed an initial claim for service connection for back disability on June 29, 2006.  He continuedly pursued the claim until service connection was granted by the Board in May 2023. In a May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the Board's grant of service connection. The claims for radiculopathy affecting the left lower extremity sciatic and femoral nerves are part and parcel of the claim for back disability. Based on this procedural history, the Board finds that the date of claim is June 29, 2006. The remaining question is when entitlement for benefits arose. 

The Veteran underwent back evaluations in November 2012 and September 2015, where the VA examiners did not diagnose radiculopathy. However, the Veteran described having pain that radiates to his buttocks, lateral thigh, and leg when driving long distance. Similarly, private treatment records from April, November, and October 2014 reflect that the Veteran reported pain in the left lower extremity. 

A December 26, 2022 DBQ is the earliest date that the evidence reflects actual diagnosis of radiculopathy affecting the left lower extremity. However, the DBQs reflect that pain that radiates down the left lower extremity is symptom of radiculopathy, and the Veteran has had that symptom since November 13, 2012. In other words, although the November 2012 and September 2015 VA examiners did not diagnose radiculopathy, the evidence reflects that the Veteran had radiculopathy symptoms during the evaluation on November 13, 2012. The Veteran is competent to describe lay observable symptoms, such as pain. His statement is found to be credible. As such, reviewing the evidence in light most favorable to the Veteran and affording him the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether his radiculopathy affecting the left lower extremity manifested on November 13, 2012. However, the record shows neither lay nor medical evidence of the condition manifested earlier than that date. 

Based on the foregoing, the date entitlement arose for service connection for radiculopathy affecting the sciatic and femoral nerves in the left lower extremity is November 13, 2012, which is later than the date of claim-June 29, 2009. Thus, the Board finds that the appropriate effective date for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy affecting the sciatic and femoral nerves is November 13, 2012. The claims are granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 26, 2022 for the grant of eligibility for DEA under 38 U.S.C. § 35 is remanded. 

The May 2023 rating decision granted DEA eligibility and assigned an effective date of December 26, 2022.

DEA benefits are provided pursuant to 38 United States Code, Chapter 35 to certain qualifying dependents of certain classes of veterans. Eligible dependents include child, surviving spouse, and spouse of a Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021. In relevant part, basic eligibility for DEA benefits requires that a veteran be rated as permanent and totally (P&T) disabled by a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021.

In this case, the Appellant did not file a claim for DEA benefits. The AOJ, however, granted this as part and parcel of the grant of combined 100 percent disability rating. Since eligibility for DEA benefits is predicated on a finding of P&T in this case, the effective date of such eligibility is consistent with the effective date of the 100 percent combined disability rating. 

Considering the earlier effective dates granted herein, the Veteran's eligibility for DEA benefits is inextricably intertwined with the AOJ implementation of the grants and assignments of initial ratings. Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Following the implementation and the assignment of initial ratings of the granted benefits in this Board decision, readjudicate the issue of entitlement to an effective date for DEA eligibility prior to December 26, 2022.
