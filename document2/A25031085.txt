REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial disability rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with major depressive disorder in excess of 50 percent disabling prior to May 11, 2022, and in excess of 70 percent thereafter is remanded.

Entitlement to a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) prior to May 11, 2022, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an initial disability rating for PTSD with major depressive disorder, in excess of 50 percent disabling prior to May 11, 2022, and in excess of 70 percent thereafter is remanded.

In VA treatment records dated in May 2002 and October 2009, the providder identified relevant outstanding private treatment records. During a January 2019 VA examination, the Veteran reproted he began seeking mental health treatment "sometimes after 1999." He noted he was seen for issues with "my stress and depression." He also stated he was inpatient hospitalized twice at private facilities. 

VA has a duty to assist claimants to obtain evidence needed to substantiate a claim. 38 U.S.C. ยง 5103A (2012); 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.159(c). VA's duty to assist claimants to obtain evidence needed to substantiate a claim includes making reasonable efforts to obtain relevant private medical records. 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.159(c)(1). VA's failure to make attempts to obtain the private treatment records is a pre-decisional duty to assist error. A remand, therefore, is required to allow VA to obtain authorization and request these records.

2. Entitlement to TDIU prior to May 11, 2022, is remanded.

Finally, because a decision on the remanded issue of an increased rating for PTSD could significantly impact a decision on the issue of entitlement to TDIU prior to May 11, 2022, the issues are inextricably intertwined. A remand of the claim is required.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Ask the Veteran to identify any private treatment records he may have for his mental health disabilities, and request that he complete a VA Form 21-4142 for any identified private records. Make two requests for the authorized records, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile. If it is clear after the first attempt that a second request would be futile, such finding should be associated with the record.
