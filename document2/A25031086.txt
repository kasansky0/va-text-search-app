ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right hand carpal tunnel syndrome is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for left hand carpal tunnel syndrome is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome is considered an other organic disease of the nervous system, and it manifested to a compensable degree within one year of the Veteran's final day of active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for left hand carpal tunnel syndrome are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303; 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for right hand carpal tunnel syndrome are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303; 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2000 to March 2005. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

In the Veteran's Form 10182, he purported to raise appeals for the following benefits: (1) service connection for left carpal tunnel syndrome; (2) service connection for right carpal tunnel syndrome; and (3) service connection for a left elbow disability. As above, the two carpal tunnel issues are properly before the Board. The left elbow claim, however, was not effectively appealed to the Board via the Form 10182 in August 2024. Upon review, there is no rating decision for a left elbow claim during the one-year period before the August 2024 receipt date for the Form 10182. See Form 10182, August 4, 2024 (purporting to appeal a left elbow claim with a decision date of "2017-03-17"); Rating Decision, March 2017 (denying service connection for left elbow degenerative joint disease); NOD Clarification Letter, August 31, 2024 ("The VA decision you disagree with was issued before February 19, 2019, and [it] is still in the legacy (non-modernized) system"); Informal Hearing Presentation, October 2024 (addressing only the two claims for carpal tunnel syndrome). Therefore, a left elbow claim is not presently before the Board for adjudication. 

The Board notes that the Veteran's initial claim for carpal tunnel syndrome benefits was denied by a rating decision in January 2006. The RO has found that new and relevant evidence was received to support readjudication of the Veteran's claim. See Rating Decision, July 2022. The Board will not disturb that favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

As a final preliminary matter, the Board notes that the Veteran did not waive the remainder of his window to request a docket switch pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, slip op. (Jun. 21, 2024).  Because the current decision is a full grant of the benefit sought, the lack of a waiver represents only harmless error by the Board.

Service Connection

Generally, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, or nexus, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Chronic conditions are outlined in VA regulation and include organic diseases of the nervous system (such as carpal tunnel syndrome); with respect to chronic diseases, a presumption of service connection arises if the disease is manifested to a degree of 10 percent within one year following discharge from service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1112, 1113, 1137; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.307, 3.309(a).?While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. 

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of symptoms. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case by case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "[w]hether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue to be addressed by the Board").

Once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible. See Layno, supra (distinguishing between competency, "a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered;" and credibility, "a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted"). The Board is also charged with the duty to assess the probative weight given to all evidence. Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter (which includes but is not limited to equipoise), VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 778 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to service connection for right hand carpal tunnel syndrome is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for left hand carpal tunnel syndrome is granted.

The Veteran asserts that his carpal tunnel syndrome should be service connected. After careful review, the Board must agree. 

As above, the first element of service connection is a current disability. See Shedden, supra. In the July 2024 rating decision, the RO conceded that the Veteran has a current disability of carpal tunnel syndrome. The Board will not disturb that favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the Veteran has met the first element of service connection. 

Carpal tunnel syndrome is considered a chronic disability for the purpose of presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), as an "[o]ther organic disease[] of the nervous system." See also Rating Decision, July 2024 ("The claimed disability is a chronic disease which may be presumptively linked to your military service"); 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c) (favorable findings). As a chronic disability, carpal tunnel syndrome will be service connected if evidence shows that it manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year following separation from service. 

Upon review, the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome within one year of his final service day on March 22, 2005. The Veteran submitted his initial claim for "Aches and Cramping in Hands" in September 2005. Application for Compensation or Pension. He reported that the onset date for this disability was "05/01/05." In November 2005, a VA examiner diagnosed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. As shown, the Veteran was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome within one year of separation from service. 

During the 2005 examination, the examiner assessed that the Veteran's carpal tunnel symptoms included "pain in all the MCP's and PIP's as well as tingling in the palms. The symptoms described occur constantly. [] From the above condition the functional impairment is a feeling of weakness in the hands." The Board finds that under 38 CFR § 4.124a, those symptoms would qualify for at least a 10 percent evaluation for mild incomplete paralysis. See Diagnostic Code 8515. Therefore, evidence shows that the Veteran's carpal tunnel syndrome manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year following separation from service.

Accordingly, the Veteran's carpal tunnel syndrome must be granted presumptive service connection based on the rules for chronic disabilities. 38?C.F.R. §§?3.307, 3.309(a). Therefore, his claim for service connection for left and right carpal tunnel syndrome is granted. As shown, the positive and negative evidence are not in a state of approximate balance; the Veteran needs no benefit of the doubt. See Lynch, supra.
