ORDER

The appeal concerning service connection for hemorrhoids is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In June 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received written notification from the Veteran's attorney indicating that the Veteran requested withdrawal of the appeal concerning service connection for hemorrhoids.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran or his authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2004 to June 2009 with several additional periods of active service while in the Air Force and Army National Guard.  

This matter is before the Board following his appeal of a November 2020 rating decision that was issued in response to a July 2020 request for a higher level review of a December 2019 rating decision.  The claim on appeal was filed in August 2019.

On a November 2021 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran selected the hearing docket.  However, in June 2024, he withdrew his hearing request.  

Withdrawal of Appeal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

Here, the Veteran's attorney submitted a written statement in June 2024 indicating that the Veteran requested withdrawal of the appeal concerning service connection for hemorrhoids.  Thus, the appeal for service connection for hemorrhoids has been withdrawn and there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review that appeal and it is dismissed.
