ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee meniscal tear, status post anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (right knee limitation of flexion) is denied.

Entitlement to a separate 10 percent disability rating for right knee meniscal condition is granted.

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for shin pain/condition/surgery, bilateral (shin disability) is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for scar formation, bilateral shins, left is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for scar formation, bilateral shins, right knee is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Right knee limitation of flexion manifested as flexion to, at worst, 130 degrees.  At no time during the claim period was right knee flexion limited to 30 degrees or less, even considering pain on use and during flareups.

2. The right knee meniscal condition manifested as frequent effusion throughout the claim period.  

3. The bilateral shin disability has not manifested as functional impairment equivalent to malunion or non-union of the tibia or fibula with knee or ankle disability and has not required treatment for at least 12 consecutive months or been unresponsive to either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment.  

4. The left shin scar is not painful or unstable and does not cover an area more than 39 square centimeters or more.

5. The right shin scar is not painful or unstable and does not cover an area more than 39 square centimeters or more.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1998 to January 1999, February 2006 to June 2006, August 2008 to August 2009, April 2011 to February 2012 and from February 2019 to September 2019.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2022 rating decision.  

Following the April 2022 rating decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) and selected the Direct Review docket.  Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of April 11, 2022-the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after April 11, 2022, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Increased Ratings

Generally, disability ratings are determined by applying the rating criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and represent the average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10. 

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA compensation, as well as the whole recorded history of the Veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; see generally Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Where there is a question of which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Otherwise, the lower rating is assigned.  Id.  Additionally, while it is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

Where the appellant has expressed dissatisfaction with the assignment of a rating, separate, or "staged," ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found.   Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

When evaluating joint disabilities rated on the basis of limitation of motion, VA must consider granting a higher rating in cases in which functional loss due to pain, weakness, excess fatigability, or incoordination is demonstrated, and those factors are not contemplated in the relevant rating criteria. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  Although pain may be a cause or manifestation of functional loss, limitation of motion due to pain is not necessarily rated at the same level as functional loss where motion is impeded. See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).  Thus, functional loss caused by pain must be rated at the same level as if the functional loss were caused by any of the other factors cited above.  See id.  In evaluating the severity of a joint disability, VA must determine the overall functional impairment due to these factors. The Court has held that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 are not limited to arthritis and must be considered when raised by the claimant or when reasonably raised by the record. Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

The intent of the rating schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint and periarticular pathology as productive of disability. It is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or maligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

Right Knee Disability 

Normal flexion of the knee is to 140 degrees, and normal extension of the knee is to 0 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

Generally, the joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weightbearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint. Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158, 168-69 (2016); 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

The Veteran has an initial 10 percent disability rating for right knee limitation of flexion, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260, effective December 20, 2021.  Under Diagnostic Code 5260, leg flexion limited to 60 degrees warrants a noncompensable rating.  Leg flexion limited to 45 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating; 30 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating and 15 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.

Additionally, Diagnostic Codes 5258 and 5259 are assigned for symptoms associated with removal or dislocation of semilunar cartilage.  Specifically, Diagnostic Code 5258 is assigned for frequent episodes of locking, pain, and effusion of the knee joint.  Diagnostic Code 5259 is assigned for symptoms of a lesser degree than those contemplated by Diagnostic Code 5258.  

In Lyles v. Shulkin, the Court held that evaluation of a knee disability under the diagnostic codes for recurrent subluxation or instability; limitation of extension; or limitation of flexion does not preclude as a matter of law a separate evaluation of a meniscal disability under Diagnostic Code 5258 or 5259. 29 Vet. App. 107, 115-16 (2017).  Thus, separate ratings can be assigned for knee disabilities when none of the symptomatology overlaps and the separate rating is based on additional disabling symptomatology; this includes separate ratings based on limitation of flexion (Diagnostic Code 5260), limitation of extension (Diagnostic Code 5261), lateral instability or recurrent subluxation (Diagnostic Code 5257), and meniscal conditions (Diagnostic Codes 5258, 5259).  See VAOPGCPREC 23-97, 62 Fed. Reg. 63,603 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 9-98, 63 Fed. Reg. 56,703 (1998); VAOPGCPREC 9-2004; 69 Fed. Reg. 59,988 (2004); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017), supra.

After review of the competent medical and lay evidence, the Board finds that the preponderance of evidence is against a rating in excess of 10 percent for limitation of flexion of the right knee.  The Board also finds that a separate 10 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's meniscal disability.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for the right knee disability in February 2022.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in 2010.  The Veteran reported flareups of the right knee with running.  The Veteran did not report a history of instability or recurrent subluxation, but did report frequent effusion with running.  Range of motion of the right knee was normal on active and passive testing with no evidence of pain.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing without additional loss of function or range of motion.  The examiner estimated no loss of range of motion with repeated use over time and estimated that flexion would be limited to 130 degrees during flareups.   The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have muscle atrophy or ankylosis.  The examiner also reported no recurrent subluxation, instability or recurrent patellar instability.  The examiner noted that the complete tear of the ACL was successfully repaired and did not require a prescription for assistance with ambulation.  The examiner also noted a right knee meniscal tear with frequent episodes of joint effusion.  The Veteran did not report the use of any assistive devices.  The examiner reported that the Veteran had difficulty with prolonged standing and walking and with high impact activities.  VA treatment records include range of motion testing for the right knee in September and December 2021 reported as painless, with flexion to 130 degrees.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee limitation of flexion but is entitled to a separate 10 percent rating for the right knee meniscal condition.  The record reflects flexion to, at worst, 130 degrees.  There is no evidence suggesting that the Veteran's range of motion was measured as flexion limited to 30 degrees or less in the right knee.  The Board has considered the De Luca factors and 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 and concludes that a rating in excess of the 10 percent disability rating, assigned pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5260, is not warranted.  

The Board also finds that the Veteran is entitled to a separate 10 percent rating for his right knee meniscal condition, pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5259.  That code provides a 10 percent rating for symptomatic removal of cartilage, semilunar.  The February 2022 VA examination notes that the Veteran experienced frequent episodes of effusion and the Veteran reported swelling.  Accordingly, a 10 percent rating pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5259 is warranted.  As the record does not reflect additional meniscal symptoms, a 20 percent rating pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5258 is not warranted.  

The Board has considered whether other Diagnostic Codes may be applicable.  A compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5256 is not warranted as there is no evidence of ankylosis in the right knee.  A compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5257 is not warranted as there is no evidence of right knee instability.  A rating under Diagnostic Code 5261 is not shown as the range of motion was not shown to be limited or painful on extension.  A rating under Diagnostic Code 5263 is not shown as the record does not contain evidence showing genu recurvatum.  The Board notes that, to the extent the Veteran submitted evidence of additional symptoms with the Notice of Disagreement, that evidence is outside the evidentiary window before the Board and may not be considered as part of this appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Veteran has the ability to submit a supplemental claim with the additional evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  

In sum, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for painful flexion of the right knee at any point during the claim period but is entitled to a separate 10 percent disability rating pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5259 throughout the claim period.  To the extent the Veteran's claim for an increased disability rating is denied, the preponderance of the evidence weighs against the claim (that is to say, the weight of the evidence is neither in approximate balance nor nearly equal), and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Bilateral Shin Disabilities

The bilateral shin disabilities are rated as noncompensable under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5262, for impairment of the tibia and fibula.  That code provides a noncompensable rating for treatment less than 12 consecutive months, one or both lower extremities.  See id.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, one or both lower extremities.  See id.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, one lower extremity.  See id.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, both lower extremities.  See id.  Diagnostic Code 5262 also provides that, for malunion of the tibia and fibula, evaluate under diagnostic codes 5256, 5257, 5260, or 5261 for the knee, or 5270 or 5271 for the ankle, whichever results in the highest evaluation.  See id.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for nonunion of the tibia and fibula, with loose motion, requiring brace.  See id.  

The Board finds that the evidence of record does not support a compensable rating for the bilateral shin splint disability.  The February 2022 VA examiner noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with chronic exertional compartment syndrome, status post-fasciotomy in both lower extremities.  The examiner noted that the Veteran was seen for shin splints in 2006 and was noted to have stress fractures from running.  The Veteran had surgery in 2012, and the examiner reported that the condition was responsive to surgery.  The Veteran reported to the examiner that he did not experience any further compartment syndrome or shin splints following the surgery.   The Veteran did not report the use of any assistive devices or orthotics.  Thus, the February 2022 VA examination does not support a compensable rating for the bilateral shin splints under Diagnostic Code 5262.  To the extent the examination reflects painful motion and swelling of the right knee, those symptoms are compensated by the ratings assigned for the right knee disability, and additional compensation under Code 5262 would constitute impermissible pyramiding.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017), supra (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment).  To the extent that the examination also reflected left knee symptoms, the examiner did not attribute those symptoms to the shin disability.  Rather, the examiner attributed the Veteran's left knee pain to the non-service-connected left ACL knee surgery in 2022.  As the record does not reflect that the Veteran underwent treatment or experienced knee or ankle limitation of motion as a result of the bilateral shin splint disability, a compensable rating is not warranted.  

The Board concludes that the evidence in this case is neither evenly nor approximately balanced.  Rather, it persuasively weighs against increased ratings for the bilateral shin disability.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine (38 U.S.C. § 5107(b)) is therefore not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Scars 

The Veteran has initial noncompensable disability ratings for scars of the right knee and left shin, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.  

Diagnostic Codes 7800 to 7805 pertain to scars.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  As the scars are not on the face, head or neck, Diagnostic Code 7800 does not apply in this case, and will not be considered.  See id.  Under Diagnostic Code 7801, a 10 percent rating was warranted for a scar that is not of the head, face or neck that is associated with underlying soft tissue damage and has an area of at least 6 square inches (39 square centimeters).  Higher ratings are available if larger areas are affected.  Under Diagnostic Code 7802, a 10 percent rating is warranted for a scar not of the head, face, or neck, that is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, and which covers an area of at least 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or more.  Under Diagnostic Code 7804, a 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two scars that are unstable or painful.  Higher ratings of 20 and 30 percent are warranted if there are three or four, or five or more, unstable or painful scars, respectively.  If one or more scars are both unstable and painful, a 10 percent rating is added to the rating that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars.  An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804, Note 1.  Under Diagnostic Code 7805, a scar may be rated on any disabling effect(s) not considered as part of Diagnostic Codes 7801 to 7804.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for the scars in February 2022.  The examiner documented the existence of 2 scars on each lower extremity.  The scars on the right lower extremity were measured as 3.5 by 0.3 centimeters and 5 by 1 centimeter.  The scars on the left lower extremity were measured as 4.5 by 0.3 centimeters and 5 by 0.3 centimeters.  The scars were not described as painful or unstable and no frequent loss of covering of skin was noted.  The scars were not due to burns.  The total approximate area of the scars on the right lower extremity was reported as 6.05 centimeters and the total approximate area of the scars on the left lower extremity was reported as 2.85 centimeters.  None of the scars had underlying tissue damage.  The examiner also reported that the scars did not result in limitation of function or any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms.  

As the evidence or record reflects that the scars were not painful, unstable or affecting an area equal to or greater than 39 square centimeters, the Board finds that the scars are consistent with the assigned noncompensable ratings pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7802.  The preponderance of evidence is against the assignment of a compensable disability rating at any point during the claim period.  To the extent the Veteran offered evidence of the condition of the scars in the statement submitted with the Notice of Disagreement, that evidence is outside the evidentiary window before the Board and may not be considered as part of this appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Veteran has the ability to submit a supplemental claim with the additional evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The Board concludes that the evidence in this case is neither evenly nor approximately balanced.  Rather, it persuasively weighs against increased ratings for the scar disabilities.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine (38 U.S.C. § 5107(b)) is therefore not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
