ORDER

Entitlement to nonservice-connected pension benefits is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The appellant does not have qualifying active military service for VA pension purposes.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for basic eligibility for nonservice-connected pension benefits are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 1521; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.3, 3.6. 3.314(b), 101(2), (21), and (24).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant served in the United States Army National Guard (ARNG) on active duty for training (ADT) from October 1959 to April 1960; he was then returned to the Army National Guard of New York. See Certificate of Release (March 2023).

In February 2024, the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to nonservice-connected pension benefits most recently addressed in an October 2023 decision.  On May 22, 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 supplemental claim decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. With his VA Form 10182, the appellant submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302 and 20.303.

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The appellant has not raised any other issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist with regard to the issue decided herein. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument). Although the appellant's Army National Guard of New York service records were not obtained, the Board finds that remand for any records would service no useful purpose as it is uncontroverted that the appellant had only the ADT with USARNG on entry into the Reserve component from October 1959 to April 1960, and Army National Guard service with New York from April 1960-which is not qualifying service for pension as explained below. See Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty (March 2023). See also, Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540 (1991) (remand is unnecessary where it would result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the claimant).

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c). 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b).

Basic Pension Eligibility

Pension is payable to a veteran of a period of war who is permanently and totally disabled from nonservice-connected disability not the result of his or her own willful misconduct. 38 U.S.C. § 1521(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.3, 3.314(b). A veteran meets the service requirements of that section if he served in active military, naval, air, or space service: (1) for 90 days or more during a period of war; (2) during a period of war and was discharged or released from service for a service-connected disability; (3) for a period of 90 consecutive days or more and such period began or ended during a period of war; or (4) for an aggregate of 90 days or more in two or more separate periods of service during more than one period of war. 38 U.S.C. § 1521(j); 38 C.F.R. § 3.3(a)(3).

The term "period of war" for pension purposes means the Mexican Border Period, World War I, World War II, the Korean conflict, the Vietnam era, the Persian Gulf War, and the period beginning on the date of any future declaration of war by the Congress and ending on the date prescribed by Presidential proclamation or concurrent resolution of the Congress. 38 U.S.C. § 1501 (4); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2.

Specifically, VA presently recognizes the following as periods of war: January 1, 1817, through December 31, 1898, inclusive; April 21, 1898, through July 4, 1902, inclusive; May 9, 1916, through April 5, 1917, inclusive; April 6, 1917, through November 11, 1918, inclusive; December 7, 1941, through December 31, 1946, inclusive; June 27, 1950, through January 31, 1955, inclusive; August 5, 1964, through May 7, 1975, inclusive; and August 2, 1990, through a date yet to be prescribed by Presidential proclamation or law. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2.

The term "veteran" means a person who served in the active military, naval, air, or space service and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable. 38 U.S.C. § 101 (2).

The term "active duty" includes full-time duty in the Armed Forces, other than active duty for training (ADT). 38 U.S.C. § 101 (21). Except that, the term "active military, naval, air, or space service" includes active duty, and "any period of active duty for training during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty, and any period of inactive duty training during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty." 38 U.S.C. § 101 (24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (a); see Biggins v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 474, 477-478 (1991).

ADT and inactive duty for training (IDT) are distinct types of service from active duty service; while service on active duty alone is sufficient to meet the statutory definition of a veteran, service on ADT or IDT, without more, will not suffice to give one "veteran" status. See Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167, 172 (2010); cf. Hill v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 243, 250-52 (2016) (holding that once a claimant has achieved veteran status for a single disability incurred or aggravated during a period of ADT, veteran status applies to all disabilities claimed to have been incurred or aggravated during that period of ADT).

When a claim is based on a period of ADT, there must be evidence that the individual concerned died or became disabled during the period of ADT because of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. In the absence of such evidence, the period of ADT will not qualify as "active military, naval, air, or space service," and the appellant will not achieve "veteran" status for purposes of that claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 101 (22), (24); Mercado-Martinez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 415, 419 (1998).

Entitlement to nonservice-connected pension benefits.

The appellant generally contends that he is entitled to nonservice-connected pension benefits, stating that he served for six months on active duty with the 42nd infantry division and spent additional five-and-a-half years with the "Rainbow" division for further active reserve infantry training with the New York State Army National Guard, ending in June 1965. See Correspondence (August 2024). 

The Board concludes that, because the appellant had no qualifying service, the claim of entitlement to nonservice-connected pension benefits must be denied as a matter of law. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1502, 1521; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2, 3.3, 3.314.

In this case, the appellant's DD 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty, of record shows that he served in the United States Army National Guard (ARNG) from October 1959 to April 1960; and that he was released in April 1960 due to expiration of the term of service, returning to the ARNG of New York. Despite that the appellant had ADT with the ARNG more than 90 days, and periods of ADT and IDT with the National Guard of New York, the Board finds that veteran status is not established as a matter of law.

First, it is uncontroverted that the appellant had ADT from October 1959 to April 1960 when he participated in training upon entering the ARNG. This service does not constitute active duty service because Congress has defined "active duty" as "full-time duty in the Armed Forces, other than active duty for training." 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(21)(A) (emphasis added).

Second, although the appellant's period of ADT from October 1959 to April 1960 for the ARNG was under Title 32 for ADT, "veteran" status does not attach to this period of service because the appellant has not established that he was disabled from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. Mercado-Martinez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 415 (1998).

Third, although the appellant served in the Army National Guard of New York from September 1959, apart from the period he served in ARNG from October 1959 to April 1960, his periods of ADT and IDT during this timeframe do not constitute active duty service. The term active duty is defined as full time duty in the Armed Forces, other than active duty for training, and active duty for training includes all training in the National Guard. 38 U.S.C. § 101 (21)(A), (22) (emphasis added). To the extent that the appellant argues his National Guard of New York ADT and IDT should be counted in totaling his active duty, the Board disagrees. Simply stated, National Guard training, regardless of whether it is ADT or IDT, does not constitute active duty for the purposes of establishing eligibility for a VA pension despite that it occurred during the Vietnam War era. See 38 U.S.C. § 101 (21)(A); (22). The record does not show nor does the appellant contend that he had any federalized ADT in the National Guard from his enlistment in September 1959.

As explained above, the appellant lacks basic eligibility for VA pension as he has not established "veteran" status because the nature of his military service is not considered by law "active military service."

To the extent the appellant is raising an argument based on equity, the Board is sympathetic, but emphasizes that it is bound by the law and is without authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis. 38 U.S.C. § 503, 7104; Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416 (1994) (only VA Secretary authorized to act upon requests for equitable relief). The Board further notes that "no equities, no matter how compelling, can create a right to payment out of the United States Treasury which has not been provided for by Congress." Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992) (citing Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 486 U.S. 414, 426 (1990)).

Accordingly, the claim is denied as a matter of law. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994) (Where the law is dispositive, the claim must be denied on the basis of absence of legal merit).
