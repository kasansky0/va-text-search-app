DOCKET NO. 241028-485822

ORDER

The appeal of the proposed reduction of persistent depressive disorder with alcohol use disorder and cocaine use disorder from 70 percent to 50 percent disabling is dismissed as a matter of law.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's October 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) expressed disagreement with a September 2024 rating decision which proposed a reduction in the disability rating for persistent depressive disorder with alcohol use disorder and cocaine use disorder from 70 percent to 50 percent; the September 2024 proposed rating decision is not a final action of the agency.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

As there is no final agency action on appeal, the criteria for dismissal as a matter of law have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1977 to March 1979.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a non-final September 2024 rating decision indicating a proposed rating reduction issued by a VA Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran appealed the September 2024 rating decision indicating a proposed rating reduction by submitting an October 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  The September 2024 rating decision, however, is not a final agency action.  Rather, a rating decision merely noting a proposed agency action (in this case a proposed reduction of the disability evaluation assigned for the Veteran's psychiatric disability from 70 percent disabling to 50 percent disabling) is not binding on the agency and does not change the Veteran's level of compensation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.  Proposed findings are not adverse decisions by the AOJ and therefore cannot be appealed to the Board.  See Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 461-62 (2011) (finding that a deferred decision does not constitute an adjudicative decision from which a notice of disagreement may be filed because it is not a final decision).  The September 2024 rating decision here clearly indicated it was a non-final "proposed" reduction of the disability rating and that a final decision would be forthcoming.  The Veteran prematurely appealed the proposed rating decision, which did not include any final, binding agency action.

It is further worth noting that the AOJ thereafter did not reduce the Veteran's rating to 50 percent, but instead continued the Veteran's 70 percent rating in a subsequent December 2024 rating decision.  The Veteran has not appealed the December 2024 rating decision continuing the 70 percent rating, and the period to do so has not elapsed.  Thus, aside from appealing a non-final rating decision merely proposing a reduction which never occurred, the Veteran does not appear to have an in-fact dispute with the final rating assigned thereafter. 

Given the circumstances as described herein, the Board finds no good cause to waive the claims processing rules or infer other intent within the October 2024 VA Form 10182.  Accordingly, as the Veteran appealed a non-final rating decision merely proposing a reduction, the VA Form 10182 is invalid, and the docket herein must be dismissed.  As there is no adverse determination on appeal, the appeal is dismissed.
