ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for headaches is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's tension headaches began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for headaches have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 1991 to April 1995.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The AMA Direct Review does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  As this is a Direct Review appeal under the AMA, the record closed as of the January 2024 rating decision.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  In general, service connection requires competent and credible evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), an alternative method of establishing the second and third elements is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); see Savage v. Gober 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-97 (1997); see also Clyburn v. West, 12 Vet. App. 296, 302 (1999).  Continuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant can demonstrate (1) that a condition was "noted" during service; (2) evidence of post- service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology.  Savage, 10 Vet. App. at 495-96; see Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (lay evidence of in-service incurrence is sufficient in some circumstances for purposes of establishing service connection); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  

However, in Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013), the Federal Circuit held that the theory of continuity of symptomatology can be used only in cases involving those conditions explicitly recognized as chronic by 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1337-39 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  For disabilities that are not listed as chronic, the only avenue for service connection is by showing in-service incurrence or aggravation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), or by showing that a disease that was first diagnosed after service is related to service under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Headaches are recognized as a chronic condition by 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).

Certain chronic diseases, including headaches, may be presumed to have been incurred in or aggravated by service if manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for headaches is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for headaches, which he contends are related to radiation exposure from working as a nuclear mechanic on a submarine in service.  See VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (August 12, 2023).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tension headaches, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's diagnosis of tension headaches began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Veteran has offered conflicting accounts of when his headache condition began.  On his August 2023 claim, he contended that he has had extreme headaches since working in reactor compartments on a submarine during his active service.  However, the December 2023 VA examination records onset of the Veteran's tension headaches in 2012, many years after separation from service, with the Veteran only reporting that he has experienced headaches for "many years." 

Service treatment records show a single complaint of headaches associated with stomach pain, diarrhea, and dizziness in September 1994.  The Veteran denied frequent or severe headaches on Reports of Medical History completed in November 1992 and April 1995.  No complaints of headaches were noted at the Veteran's April 1995 separation physical. 

Post-service, VA outpatient treatment records show that when first establishing care with VA in December 1999, the Veteran denied headaches at that time.  Decades later, he complained of headaches associated with the use of generic omeprazole, alleviated when he switched to brand name medication.  See VA Primary Care Annual Physical (April 15, 2021).

The December 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's tension headaches are not at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, including his in-service complaint of headache in September 1994 and his in-service radiation exposure.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had only a single isolated complaint of headaches in service and because the complaint was associated with other symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, reflux, and dizziness, the single report is not consistent with a persistent headache condition.  The examiner further explained that after review of medical records and thorough search of medical literature, it is evident that [toxic exposure risk activity] is not a known etiology of headaches.  The examiner's opinions are probative, because they are based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

The Board concludes that the weight of the evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran's current tension headaches began during service.  While the Board has considered the Veteran's August 2023 contention that his headaches began during service, his service treatment records do not show a chronic headache condition and instead show that on several occasions, the Veteran actually denied experiencing frequent or severe headaches.  The Veteran continued to deny headaches when establishing care at VA in 1999, several years after his separation from service.   The Board finds these contemporaneous medical records denying a chronic headache condition have greater probative value that statements made by the Veteran decades later in the context of seeking compensation.  See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59, 68 (1994) (contemporaneous evidence has greater probative value than history as reported by the veteran).  

The Board further concludes that the weight of the evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran's current condition is related to service, to include any in-service TERA, based on the negative nexus opinions of the December 2023 VA medical examiner.

The Veteran has not submitted any medical evidence contradicting the conclusions of the December 2023 VA examiner or otherwise supporting a relationship between the Veteran's current disability and service.  For all the above reasons, entitlement to service connection for headaches must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
