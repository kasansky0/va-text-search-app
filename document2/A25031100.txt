DOCKET NO. 240729-458807
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his OSA is proximately due and/or aggravated by service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder with obesity as an intermediate step.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for OSA are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2006 to March 2010.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection also may be established on a secondary basis for disability that is proximately due to, or the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  Establishing secondary service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability (for which secondary service connection is sought); (2) an already service-connected disability; and (3) indication the current disability was either (a) caused or (b) is being aggravated by the service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) and (b); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Board notes that obesity is not considered a disease or disability for VA purposes and is not subject to service connection. See Marcelino v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 155, 156 (2018). However, obesity may be an intermediate step between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service-connected on a secondary basis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; see also Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020). But see Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (invalidating 3.310(b) for the use of the phrase "proximately due to" in the context of aggravation). 

The concept of obesity as an "intermediate step" in the service connection context was recently addressed by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in Garner v. Tran, 33?Vet. App.?241 (2021). 

In Garner, the Court observed that in January 2017, VA's Office of General Counsel (OGC) issued a precedential opinion, finding that although obesity cannot be service connected on a direct basis, obesity may serve as an intermediate step between a service-connected disability and a condition claimed on a secondary basis.  VAOPGCPREC 1-2017.  To decide such claims, OGC stated the analysis involves addressing the following questions: (1) whether the service-connected disability caused the Veteran to become obese (or, aggravated the veteran's obesity); (2) if so, whether obesity/aggravation of obesity as a result of the service-connected disability, was a substantial factor in causing the claimed secondary disability; and (3) whether the claimed secondary disability would not have occurred but for obesity caused/obesity aggravated by the service connected disability.  Id.  The Court acknowledged that the soundness of OGC's guidance was endorsed in its decision in Walsh v. Wilkie, 32?Vet. App.?300, 305-07 (2020).  However, the Court noted that neither OGC's opinion nor Walsh provided guidance regarding what factual circumstances would give rise to claims for secondary service connection with this theory of entitlement. Therefore, if all of Walsh factors are answered in the affirmative, then the current disability may be service connected on a secondary basis, based on obesity.  

The Court provided the following non-exhaustive list of considerations that could give rise to a reasonably raised theory of secondary service connection with obesity as an intermediate step: (1) mobility limitations or reduced physical activity as a result of a service connected physical disability (in particular, orthopedic conditions or chronically painful conditions); (2) reduced physical activity or inability to follow a course of exercise or diet as a result of service-connected mental disability; (3) side effects of medication (e.g., weight gain), where the medication is prescribed for a service connected disability; (4) treatise evidence suggesting a connection between all or some combination of obesity, service connected disability, and the claimed condition; (5) lay statements by a Veteran attributing weight gain or obesity to the service connected disability; and (6) statements by treating physicians or medical examiners attributing weight gain or obesity to the service-connected disability.  Id. at 248.

1. Entitlement to service connection for OSA is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for sleep apnea.  

The October 2023 rating decision made a favorable finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with OSA.  Additionally, an August 2023 Polysomnography Report noted a diagnosis of OSA.  The Veteran has service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder, effective February 12, 2020.  See October 2023 Rating Decision - Codesheet. As such, the only remaining issue with whether a nexus can be established.  The Board notes the record contains both positive and negative opinions.

The July 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's OSA was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of service-connected anxiety disorder.  The rationale was that the conditions are not medically related; a thorough review of medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship; pharyngeal narrowing and closure during sleep is a complex phenomenon and likely multiple factors play a role in the pathogenesis; sleep-related reduced ventilatory drive and neuromuscular combined with anatomic risk factors are likely to play a significant role in upper airway obstruction during sleep; the anatomic factors that promote pharyngeal narrowing include large neck circumference, soft tissue, bone, or vessels, many of which structures can lead to increased surrounding pressure of the upper airway resulting in pharyngeal collapsibility and/or insufficient space to accommodate the airflow in a portion of the upper airway during sleep; the upper airway muscle tone plays a role because when it decreases, a repetitive total or partial airway collapse results; the most common cause of OSA in adults is    obesity, male sex, and advancing age.

The November 2022 private examiner opined that the Veteran's OSA was at least as likely as not due and/or aggravated by service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder with obesity as an intermediate step.  The rationale was that the examiner reviewed all available pertinent medical records; the Veteran's service-connected disability caused pain, painful motion, sleep disturbances (related to pain and forced sleep positions related to disabilities), diminished motivation, and/or "comfort" overeating, which could lead to diminished activity with less caloric expenditure, which then leads to and/or promotes weight gain and obesity; obesity predisposes patients to and directly causes OSA; the condition exacerbates hyperglycemia and other neuroendocrine chemicals and processes and promotes further weight gain due to an induced metabolic syndrome that progresses weight gain and worsens OSA in a cyclical fashion. The Veteran had a noted BMI of 33 and a neck circumference greater than 16 inches. The Veteran's treatment records also revealed a history of obesity.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's OSA is secondary to his service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder.  Accordingly, after resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for OSA is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
