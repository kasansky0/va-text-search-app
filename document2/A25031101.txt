DOCKET NO. 220907-275285
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The claim of entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On July 22, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant, or his authorized representative, are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1997 to June 2004.

This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2022 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which granted service connection for PTSD with a 30 percent rating, effective March 22, 2022. 

In the September 2022 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran selected the Hearing Review Docket, appealing the above-referenced issue to the Board. A Board hearing has not yet been held.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.55(b)(1).

In the present case, the appellant has withdrawn this appeal in writing with the Veteran's name, applicable file number, and a statement requesting withdrawal of his PTSD claim. Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
