ORDER

From April 14, 2023 to September 18, 2023, entitlement to an initial compensable rating for a chest muscle strain is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 14, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a chest muscle strain is denied.

From May 3, 2023 to May 22, 2024, entitlement to a compensable rating for a chest muscle strain is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a right arm disability is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. From April 14, 2023 to September 18, 2023, the Veteran's chest muscle strain was not manifested by loss of power, weakness, lower threshold of fatigue, fatigue-pain, impairment of coordination, or uncertainty of movement.

2. The Veteran's current effective date of April 14, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a chest muscle strain, is the day after separation from service, the earliest available.

3. From May 3, 2023 to May 22, 2024, the Veteran's chest muscle strain was not manifested by loss of power, weakness, lower threshold of fatigue, fatigue-pain, impairment of coordination, or uncertainty of movement.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a right arm disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

5. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had ED at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

6. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's right shoulder disability began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 2021 to April 2023.

For the claims of entitlement to an initial compensable rating for a chest muscle strain; entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 14, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a chest muscle strain; and entitlement to service connection for a right arm disability, the rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

For the claim of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED), the rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

For the claims of entitlement to a compensable rating for a chest muscle strain and entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability, the rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023, April 2024, and May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. From April 14, 2023 to September 18, 2023, entitlement to an initial compensable rating for a chest muscle strain

The Veteran contends he is entitled to a higher initial rating as his chest muscle strain caused him constant pain daily.  See June 2024 Notice of Disagreement. 

Under Diagnostic Code 5321, which applies to the thoracic muscle Group XXI, a 10 percent rating is assigned for moderate disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.73, Diagnostic Code 5321.  For VA rating purposes, the cardinal signs and symptoms of a muscle disability are loss of power, weakness, lower threshold of fatigue, fatigue-pain, impairment of coordination, and uncertainty of movement.  38 C.F.R. § 4.56 (c).

The factors for determining whether muscle disability is slight, moderate, or severe are particular to the evaluation of healed wounds, such as those from gunshots or other missiles.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.55, 4.56.  Although the Veteran does not have residuals of gunshot wounds or retained metal fragments, the analogous code describes a moderate muscle injury as follows:

A moderate disability of muscles is defined as a through and through or deep penetrating wound of short track from a single bullet, small shell, or shrapnel fragment, without explosive effect of high velocity missile, residuals of debridement, or prolonged infection.  Service department record or other evidence of in-service treatment for wound.  Record of consistent complaint of one or more of the cardinal signs and symptoms of muscle disability, particularly lowered threshold of fatigue after average use, affecting the particular functions controlled by the injury muscles.  Objective findings will include entrance and (if present) exit scars, some loss of deep fascia or muscle substance or impairment of muscle tone and loss of power or lowered threshold of fatigue when compared to the sound side.  38 C.F.R. § 4.56 (d)(2).

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in August 2023.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran had a non-penetrating muscle injury.  The Veteran reported chest muscular pain.  No other signs or symptoms were present.

The Board has reviewed the evidence of record and finds that from April 14, 2023 to September 18, 2023, an initial compensable rating for a muscle strain is not warranted.

A higher rating is not warranted as, even considering the Veteran's reports of pain, the evidence does not show a moderate disability.  The Veteran's muscle strain is a non-penetrating muscle injury that does not result in loss of power, weakness, lower threshold of fatigue, fatigue-pain, impairment of coordination, and uncertainty of movement.

Therefore, from April 14, 2023 to September 18, 2023, entitlement to an initial compensable rating for a muscle strain is denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 14, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a chest muscle strain

The Veteran generally contends he is entitled to an effective date earlier than April 14, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a chest muscle strain.  See June 2024 Notice of Disagreement.

Under governing law, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection, shall be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2). 

The Veteran's current effective date for the grant of service connection for his chest muscle strain is April 14, 2023.

The Veteran filed his intent to file a claim seeking service connection on May 16, 2023 and filed his fully developed claim on July 10, 2023.  

The Veteran's date of separation from service is April 13, 2023.

As the Veteran filed his claim seeking service connection for a chest muscle strain within one year of separation from service, the proper effective date is the day following separation from service.  That effective date is April 14, 2023, the Veteran's current effective date.

This is the earliest effective date possible.

Therefore, entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 14, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a chest muscle strain is denied.

3. From May 3, 2023 to May 22, 2024, entitlement to a compensable rating for a chest muscle strain

The Veteran contends he is entitled to a higher rating as his chest muscle strain continues to cause him pain and he did not receive a VA examination.  See June 2024 Notice of Disagreement.

The Veteran filed a new increased rating claim on a VA 21-526EZ Form on May 3, 2024 seeking an increased rating for his chest muscle strain.  This is considered an initial claim, thus starting a new rating period, that begins during the one-year look back period prior to the claim on May 3, 2023 and ends the date of the rating decision on appeal, May 22, 2024.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in May 2024.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran had a non-penetrating muscle injury and that the disability had remained the same with no changes or worsening.  No other signs or symptoms were present.

The Board has reviewed the evidence of record and finds that from May 3, 2023 to May 22, 2024, a compensable rating for a muscle strain is not warranted.

A higher rating is not warranted as the evidence does not show that the Veteran's disability had worsened or that it was a moderate disability.  The Veteran's muscle strain is a non-penetrating muscle injury that does not result in loss of power, weakness, lower threshold of fatigue, fatigue-pain, impairment of coordination, and uncertainty of movement.

Therefore, from May 3, 2023 to May 22, 2024, entitlement to a compensable rating for a muscle strain is denied.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a right arm disability

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for his right arm as it hurts him daily.  See June 2024 Notice of Disagreement.  

In order to establish entitlement to service connection, there must generally be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) causal connection between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a right arm disability.

The Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence shows no current right arm disability, either by diagnosis or by functional impairment, including based on lay evidence reports.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018).  The competent evidence of record does not demonstrate a current right arm disability in any of the medical treatment records and the Veteran is not competent to render his own diagnosis.  See generally King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that it was not erroneous for the Board to find that a lay veteran claiming service connection for a back disorder and his wife lacked the "requisite medical training, expertise, or credentials needed to render a diagnosis" and that their testimony "could not establish medical causation nor was it a competent opinion as to medical causation").

While the Board is cognizant of the ruling in Saunders, which held that pain alone may constitute a disability, in this case the evidence has not demonstrated, and the Veteran has not even alleged, that his right arm disability has resulted in an impairment of earning capacity.  As such, in this case, neither the lay nor the medical evidence shows a functionally impairing right arm disability.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in August 2023.  The VA examiner indicated the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of a right arm disability.

The Board has also considered the lay statement by the Veteran's girlfriend that he has difficulty carrying things as a result of his right arm disability.  See March 2024 Buddy/ Lay Statement.

While the Veteran and his girlfriend believe there is a current diagnosis of a right arm disability, the Veteran and his girlfriend are not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

As the first element of service connection has not been met, a current diagnosis, entitlement to service connection for a right arm disability is denied.

In reaching the above conclusions the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the claim that doctrine is not applicable in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

5. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED)

The Veteran contends his ED is secondary to medication taken to treat his service-connected PTSD.  See June 2024 Notice of Disagreement.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of ED.

The Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence shows no current ED disability, either by diagnosis or by functional impairment, including based on lay evidence reports.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018).  The competent evidence of record does not demonstrate a current ED disability in any of the medical treatment records and the Veteran is not competent to render his own diagnosis.  See generally King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that it was not erroneous for the Board to find that a lay veteran claiming service connection for a back disorder and his wife lacked the "requisite medical training, expertise, or credentials needed to render a diagnosis" and that their testimony "could not establish medical causation nor was it a competent opinion as to medical causation").

While the Board is cognizant of the ruling in Saunders, which held that pain alone may constitute a disability, in this case the evidence has not demonstrated, and the Veteran has not even alleged, that his ED disability has resulted in an impairment of earning capacity.  As such, in this case, neither the lay nor the medical evidence shows a functionally impairing ED disability.

The Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination in April 2024.  However, the Veteran was a "no show" and did not attend or submit good cause as to why he was unable to attend.

The Board has also considered the lay statement by the Veteran's girlfriend that he has difficulty obtaining and maintaining an erection.  See March 2024 Buddy/ Lay Statement.

While the Veteran and his girlfriend believe there is a current diagnosis of ED, the Veteran and his girlfriend are not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

As the first element of service connection has not been met, a current diagnosis, entitlement to service connection for ED is denied.

In reaching the above conclusions the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the claim that doctrine is not applicable in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

6. Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for his right shoulder as it causes him pain daily and he was not given a VA examination.  See June 2024 Notice of Disagreement.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in August 2023.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran had a diagnosis of a right shoulder strain.  Therefore, the first element of service connection has been met.

The question for the Board is whether an in-service injury, event, or disease occurred.

The Veteran's service treatment records, including his January 2023 separation examination, are silent for complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of a right shoulder disability. 

As the second element of service connection has not been met, the claim must be denied.  Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability is denied.

In reaching the above conclusions the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the claim that doctrine is not applicable in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
