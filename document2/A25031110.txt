ORDER

Entitlement to a 10 percent initial disability rating, but no higher, for hypertension is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has a history of hypertension with diastolic pressure above 100 and systolic pressure at 160. which requires continuous medication to control.  However, his hypertension is not manifested by diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial disability rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Army from August 1983 to November 1993.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) decision on their claim to seek review.? The AMA applies to all?initial?decisions issued after February 19, 2019.?? 

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2024 rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).? The Veteran timely appealed this rating decision to the Board in a July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  The Veteran requested the direct review docket, which limits the Board's review to evidence of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal.

The Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of the Veteran's right to change Board dockets under Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §§?4.1, 4.2, 4.10. 

In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the whole recorded history to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition.  The Board has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?589 (1991).  The medical, as well as industrial history is to be considered, and a full description of the effects of the disability upon ordinary activity is also required.  38?C.F.R. §§?4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38?C.F.R. §?4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38?C.F.R. §?4.3.  Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged" ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505. 

Pyramiding, which is the evaluation of the same disability or the same manifestation of a disability under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when evaluating a Veteran's service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a Veteran prevailing in either event, or the evidence is persuasively against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied. 38?U.S.C. §?5107 (b); 38?C.F.R. §?3.102. 

1. Entitlement to a compensable rating for hypertension

In May 2024, the AOJ granted service connection for the Veteran's hypertension and awarded a noncompensable rating effective October 24, 2022.  Accordingly, the appeal period begins on December 24, 2018.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

Under Diagnostic Code 7101, hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension) is assigned a 10 percent rating for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or as a minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.  A 40 percent disability rating is warranted for diastolic pressure is predominantly 120 or more. A 60 percent disability rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more.

Here, treating records demonstrate that the Veteran has required continuous medication to control his blood pressure throughout the entire appeal period.  Treating records also reveal that the Veteran presented in numerous visits with a diastolic pressure of 100 and a systolic pressure as high as 178, despite taking medication.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that a 10 percent disability rating, but no higher, is warranted.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board notes that the Veteran requires continuous medication to control his hypertension and keep his systolic pressure below 160 and diastolic pressure below 100, and it is not always effective.  However, there is no evidence that the Veteran's systolic pressure is predominantly at 200 or more or that his diastolic pressure is predominantly 110 or greater at any time during the entire appeal period.  Accordingly, the Board finds that a 10 percent disability rating, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's hypertension beginning on October 24, 2022.
