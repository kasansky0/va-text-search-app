ORDER

Entitlement to an initial 10 percent rating, but no higher, for tension headaches is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence supports finding that the Veteran's tension headaches had characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over several months, but no worse.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial 10 percent rating, but no higher, for tension headaches have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1996 to October 2000 and from October 2000 to December 2003.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in July 2023. The Veteran selected the Direct Review docket without a Board hearing under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) by submitting a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)). Accordingly, the Board's current review is limited to the evidence at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction's (AOJ's) July 2023 rating decision. The Board cannot consider any evidence submitted by the Veteran after the rating decision on appeal.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for tension headaches

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which assigns ratings based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life, including employment, by comparing his symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Rating Schedule. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

In the case of an initial rating, the entire evidentiary record from the time of a veteran's claim for service connection to the present is of importance in determining the proper evaluation of disability, and staged ratings are to be considered in order to reflect the changing level of severity of a disability during this period. Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119 (1999). However, where entitlement to compensation has already been established and increase in disability rating is at issue, present level of disability is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?55, 58 (1994). 

Additionally, the Board must consider whether the disability has undergone varying and distinct levels of severity while the claim has been pending and provide staged ratings during those periods.?Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505, 509-10 (2007).?In the case of a staged rating, the effective date of an increase will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable from all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or if there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, with the appellant prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence persuasively weighs against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

When a question arises as to which of two ratings apply under a particular diagnostic code, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating.?38?C.F.R. §§?4.7, 4.21.?After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.?38?C.F.R. §?4.3.

In adjudicating these claims, the Board must assess the competence and credibility of the claimant.  Washington v. Nicholson, 19?Vet. App.?362 (2005).  Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology and "may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection."  Layno?v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 469 (1994);?see also?Falzone?v. Brown,?8?Vet. App.?398, 405 (1995) (lay person competent to testify to pain and visible flatness of his feet).? 

The July 2023 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for tension headaches with a noncompensable initial rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100. The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to a higher initial rating.

Under Diagnostic Code 8100, a noncompensable rating is assigned for headaches with less frequent attacks than those described in the criteria for a compensable rating. A 10 percent rating is assigned for headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging at least once in two months over the last several months. A 30 percent rating is assigned for characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months. A 50 percent rating is assigned for headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

Terms such as "prostrating" are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. It should also be noted that use of such terminology by VA examiners or other physicians, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue. All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

According to MERRIAM-WEBSTER, "prostration" is defined as "complete physical or mental exhaustion" or "the condition of powerlessness." https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prostration (last accessed March 24, 2025).

While not binding on the Board, the VA Adjudication Manual provides helpful definitions and guidance for rating disabilities under Diagnostic Code 8100. The Manual defines "prostrating" as "causing extreme exhaustion, powerlessness, debilitation or incapacitation with substantial inability to engage in normal activities." M21-1, V.iii.12.A.3.b. "Completely prostrating" means "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness with essentially total inability to engage in ordinary activities." The Manual further indicates that a veteran's own testimony regarding symptoms and limitations when having those symptoms can establish prostration as long as the testimony is credible and symptoms are otherwise competently attributed to headaches through medical evidence. M21-1, V.iii.12.A.3.d. Additionally, the Manual states that "severe economic inadaptability" denotes a degree of substantial work impairment. M21-1, V.iii.12.A.3.e. Finally, the VA Adjudication Manual defines "less frequent" prostrating attacks as being, on average, more than two months apart over the last several months, and "very frequent" attacks as being, on average, less than one month apart over the last several months. M21-1, V.iii.12.A.3.f.

In a statement received in February 2023, the Veteran indicated that he had headaches one to two times per week, when his depressive disorder symptoms were more severe. The Veteran stated that he had tingling, vertigo, dizziness, and lightheadedness during his headaches. Additionally, he stated that at least once every couple of months he had headaches that "knock [him] out of commission," rendering him totally incapacitated and unable to do any normal activities for two hours.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in June 2023. He reported taking acetaminophen for headaches. The examiner noted symptoms of constant head pain in the left eye forehead area, and nausea occurring for about one to two days. However, the examiner stated that the Veteran did not experience characteristic prostrating attacks of headache pain. The examiner noted that the Veteran was presently employed and that he lost between zero and one week of work time due to headaches in the preceding 12 months.

After considering the relevant evidence, the Board finds that an initial 10 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's headache disability. In this regard, the evidence demonstrates that he had characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the preceding several months, but not more frequently. Although the June 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran did not have prostrating attacks, the Veteran has provided competent and credible lay evidence establishing the presence of prostrating attacks. He stated in February 2023 that he experienced headaches that rendered him totally incapacitated at least once every couple of months. He further stated that these headaches rendered him unable to do any normal activities for two hours and were accompanied by tingling, lightheadedness, and dizziness. The Board finds that this lay evidence supports a finding of characteristic prostrating attacks occurring about once every two months. The Veteran stated that he would have this type and severity of headache at least once every couple of months. The Board finds that this statement indicates that his headaches occurred on an average of at least one in two months over the preceding several. Therefore, the criteria for an initial 10 percent rating for headaches have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100. 

However, the Board finds that the evidence does not support an initial rating higher than 10 percent. The Veteran's February 2023 statement that he had prostrating attacks at least once every couple of months does not support a finding that such attacks occurred once a month or more frequently, and a 30 percent initial rating is therefore not warranted. See id. Additionally, the evidence does not indicate that the Veteran had very frequent attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. The Veteran's description of the frequency of attacks does not meet the definition of "very frequent" provided in the VA Adjudication Manual. See M21-1, V.iii.12.A.3.f. Further, the evidence does not show severe economic inadaptability, as the evidence shows that the Veteran was employed and missed less than one week of work due to his headaches. Therefore, the evidence does not support an initial rating higher than 10 percent for the Veteran's headache disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

In partially denying the claim, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence persuasively weighs against the denied portion of the claim, that doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; see Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
