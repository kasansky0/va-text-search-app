ORDER

Service connection for migraine including migraine variants is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's migraines, to include migraine variants, are directly related to active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for migraines including migraine variants are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army from September 1982 to July 1986 and from June 1989 to July 2005.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Generally, service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from an injury or disease caused or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). A grant for service connection for a disability requires: (1) a present disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship ("nexus") between the present disability and the in-service event, injury, or disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including the evidence pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for chronic headaches.

The Veteran seeks service connection for headaches. He contends that his headaches are secondary to his tinnitus. See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (April 2023). The Veteran reported that while on active duty, he was performing maintenance on a command track when a co-worker unlatched the driver's hatch and let it fall while he was seated in the driver's seat. When the hatch closed, the top of his head was about a half inch above the area that would have been safe for closure of the hatch. The Veteran stated that he was nearly knocked unconscious, and the blow created quite a headache which did not go away for a couple of days. The Veteran reported the following symptoms, blurry vision, inability to concentrate, confusion, sensitivity to light and noises. He experiences migraine symptoms on average 1-2 times a week and have been doing so since the mid to late 1980s. See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (July 2024). 

The Veteran is diagnosed with acute migraines and an in-service event has been conceded. See Rating Decision - Narrative (September 2024). The Board is bound by these favorable findings. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran reported his symptoms began in the mid to late 1980s, while on active duty. He further reported that his headaches have continued and worsened since active service. See CAPRI (October 2023); see also VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (July 2024). Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). 

The Veteran's statements are consistent throughout the record. Specifically, the Veteran reported experiencing a tank hatch slamming on his head just before discharge in December 2004. See STR - Medical (September 2005). In addition, recent treatment records show the Veteran is currently being treated for persistent headaches with loss of focus. See CAPRI (October 2023). Thus, the Veteran's competent statements regarding the onset and continuous nature of his symptoms are credible and constitute probative evidence weighing in favor of the claim. 

On the other hand, the evidence includes several opinions which address toxic exposure risk activities, direct service connection, and secondary service connection. However, the Board finds these opinions inadequate. Specifically, the opinion addressing secondary service connection is incomplete as the opinion does not address whether the Veteran's headaches were aggravated by his other service-connected impairments. See C&P Exam (October 2023). The opinion regarding toxic exposure does not address the Veteran's contentions. See C&P Exam (March 2024). Finally, the opinion regarding direct service connection does not address the Veteran's competent, and well documented, statements that a hatch slammed into his head or the Veteran's credible lay statements regarding the onset and continuous nature of his symptoms. Consequently, these opinions are afforded minimal probative weight. 

On balance, the probative evidence weighs in favor of the claim and shows the Veteran incurred a chronic headache disorder in service with symptoms and treatments continuing since. Service connection, on a direct basis, for chronic headache is disorder is therefore warranted.
