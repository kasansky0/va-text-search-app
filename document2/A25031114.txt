FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025, prior to the promulgation of a Board decision, the Veteran withdrew the appeal for travel expenses incurred on July 16, 2024.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

(Continued on the next page)

?

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In March 2025, the Veteran's representative submitted a written statement to the Board requesting withdrawal of the September 2024 appeal of a VA decision that denied travel pay.  As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
