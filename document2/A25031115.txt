ORDER

Entitlement to an initial, compensable disability rating for service-connected scars, anterior trunk, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service-connected scars of the anterior trunk are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage and do not cover an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 centimeters cm.) or greater.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial, compensable disability rating for service-connected scars, anterior trunk, have not been met during the entire appellate period.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7, 4.31, 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7802.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1996 to July 2000.

By a December 2023 rating decision, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for scars, anterior trunk, and assigned the same an initial noncompensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7802.  The Veteran submitted a timely June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), electing Direct Review of her claim.  The Board may thus only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 rating decision, issued on December 26, 2023.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the December 2023 rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an initial, compensable disability rating for service-connected scars, anterior trunk.

Disability ratings are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  Where there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  38 C.F.R.       § 4.7.  In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent rating under the pertinent DC, a zero percent rating (noncompensable) shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Where the appeal concerns the initial rating assigned a service-connected disability, as is the case here, VA assesses the level of disability from the effective date of service connection, here, August 10, 2022.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125 (1999); 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Because the level of disability may have varied over the course of the claim, the rating may be "staged" higher or lower for segments of time during the period under review in accordance with such variations, to the extent the evidence shows distinct time periods where the service-connected disability has exhibited signs or symptoms that would warrant different ratings under the rating criteria.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.  A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance-which includes but is not limited to equipoise-the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt-rule does not apply.  Id. at 781-82.

In the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted service connection for anterior scars on the Veteran's trunk, related to her radical mastectomy secondary to breast cancer.  She was assigned two, separate ratings for these scars -  (1) a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7804 based upon five painful scars, and (2) a noncompensable disability rating under Diagnostic Code 7802 based upon the size of the area covered by the five scars.  It is the initial noncompensable rating assigned to the Veteran's scars under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7802 that she has appealed to the Board.  She did not appeal the 30 percent rating assigned for the scars under DC 7804.  Therefore, the Board will not address that issue.  

As noted, the Veteran's service-connected scars, anterior trunk, are rated under DC 7802, pertaining to burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for a scar or scars covering an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 square cm.) or greater.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802.

Note (1) to DC 7802 provides that the six zones of the body are defined as each extremity, anterior trunk, and posterior trunk.  The midaxillary line divides the anterior trunk from the posterior trunk.  Id.  Under Note (2), separate ratings may be assigned for each affected zone of the body under DC 7802 if there are multiple scars, or a single scar, affecting multiple zones of the body.  These separate ratings are to be combined.  Id.  Alternatively, if a higher rating would result from adding the areas affected from multiple zones of the body, a single rating may also be assigned under DC 7802.  Id.

DC 7801 pertains to burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R.     § 4.118, DC 7801.  DC 7805 pertains to "scars, other and other effects of scars evaluated under DCs 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804."  It provides that any disabling effect(s) of scars not considered in a rating under DCs 7800-04 are to be evaluated under an appropriate DC.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7805.

The Veteran's VA and private treatment records appear silent for complaint or treatment for her service-connected scars of the anterior trunk.  During her December 2023 VA scars Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), the Veteran presented with five scars on her anterior trunk related to her bilateral mastectomy.  The scars were located on the right breast inflammatory fold, right nipple, left breast inflammatory fold, left nipple, and right axilla.  None of the scars had underlying soft tissue damage.  The examiner described the five scars as measuring 11 cm. by 0.1 cm.; 4 cm. by 0.1 cm.; 11 cm. by 0.1 cm.; 4 cm. by 0.1 cm.; and 4.5 cm. by 0.1 cm.  The total area of the scars was 3.45 cm. squared.  The scars did not result in limitation of motion or function.  The Veteran had no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms.  There was no functional impact on the Veteran's ability to work. 

DC 7801 may not serve as a basis for an increased rating in the present appeal as the December 2023 VA examiner specifically found that the Veteran's service-connected scars of the anterior trunk are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, the manifestation contemplated by DC 7801.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7801.  

DC 7802 may also not serve as a basis for an increased rating in the present appeal.  The December 2023 VA examiner specifically measured the five scars on the Veteran's anterior trunk as encompassing a total area of 3.45 cm. squared, which is far less than the 929 cm. squared as is required for the assignment of a 10 percent rating under DC 7802.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802.

Further, DC 7805 may not serve as a basis for an increased rating as the December 2023 VA examiner specifically found no disabling effects related to the Veteran's service-connected scars of the anterior trunk.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7805.  The examiner stated that the scars did not result in limitation of motion or function, and that there was no functional impact on the Veteran's ability to work.  There is no lay evidence or medical evidence showing any disabling effects of the Veteran's scars, apart from the pain compensated by the 30 percent rating assigned under DC 7804.

In sum, based on the above, the criteria for an initial, compensable disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected scars, anterior trunk, under DC 7802 have not been met during the current appeal.  As the persuasive evidence is against the claim, the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal; therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied.  See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82; 38 U.S.C.   § 5107.
