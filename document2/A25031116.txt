ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The most probative evidence of record supports a finding that bilateral hearing loss began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Coast Guard from October 2003, until October 2007.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

The Veteran filed two separate VA Form 10182's, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), on which the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. The first was dated April 19, 2024, and the other dated May 29, 2024; however, since both cite the same decision on appeal and concern the same issue on appeal, the Board is treating the second as duplicative and an additional decision is not needed. The Board also notes that the decision on appeal is the June 21, 2023, rating decision, as this was specifically noted on the Veteran's filed VA Form 10182. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 21, 2023, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Initially, the Board notes that the AOJ's decision on appeal states that "bilateral hearing loss remains denied because the evidence submitted is not new and relevant." However, within the decision itself, the AOJ acknowledges that new and relevant evidence was received and then states, "the claim is now reconsidered." Based on the June 21, 2023, rating decision citing the new evidence of record as new and relevant, the Board is treating the rating decision as a denial on its merits, rather than a denial for a lack of new and relevant evidence.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service - the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In addition, service connection for certain chronic diseases, may be established on a presumptive basis by showing that the condition manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271-72 (2015).  Although the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumptive period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).

Additionally, for certain chronic diseases with potential onset during service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

The Veteran asserts that his bilateral hearing loss is related to his active-duty service.

First, the Board finds that there is a current disability.  See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). The June 21, 2023, rating decision issued by the AOJ provided a favorable finding that the June 1, 2023, VA medical examination shows a currently diagnosed bilateral hearing loss disability. The Board is bound by the favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Board therefore finds that the Veteran has met the first element of service connection, a current disability.

Second, the Board finds that there was an in-service event, injury or disease.  See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). The June 21, 2023, rating decision issued by the AOJ also provided a favorable finding that the Veteran's military occupational specialty as a machinery technician had a high probability of hazardous noise exposure. With this MOS, the AOJ presumed that the Veteran's in service exposure to hazardous noise meets the second element of service connection. Again, the Board is bound by the favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

Therefore, the element of service connection at issue is the third, in which the Board finds that the evidence of record supports a finding that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is related to active service.

The Veteran was afforded an initial VA examination in July 2021, in which the examiner found that the Veteran had normal hearing loss, and therefore no disability was diagnosed during this examination. However, this examiner found that any hearing loss suffered by the Veteran would be related to the Veteran's in-service hazardous noise exposure. The AOJ provided a favorable finding in September 2021, in which it found that the Veteran's claimed bilateral hearing loss disability is presumptively linked to the Veteran's military service.

The Veteran was also afforded a VA examination on June 1, 2023, in which the examiner did provide the Veteran with a bilateral hearing loss diagnosis, but ultimately concluded that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was less likely than not related to the Veteran's in-service noise exposure. The examiner's rationale was based on the Veteran having no reports or complaints of hearing loss in service, as well as having a normal separation hearing loss examination. Additionally, the rationale included a statement concurring with the 2006 IOM report regarding limited evidence to support delayed onset of hearing loss after service. The Board finds that this rationale to be inadequate as it is conclusory. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A] medical opinion...must supports its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions").  While the June 2023, VA examiner opined that the Veteran's hearing loss is less likely than not related to his active-duty service, the rationale is not supported by any rationale other than the 2006 IOM report, nor does the examiner provide any additional medical reference to support this opinion.

The Board acknowledges that in June 2019 the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) issued a decision in McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243 (2019).  In McCray, the Court discussed the above noted 2006 IOM report.  The Court noted that the IOM report concluded, in part, that "based on current knowledge of cochlear physiology there was no sufficient scientific basis for the existence of delayed-onset hearing loss."  However, the IOM report also indicated that "[t]here is not sufficient evidence from longitudinal studies in laboratory animals or humans to determine whether permanent noise-induced hearing loss can develop much later in one's lifetime, long after the cessation of that noise exposure" and that "definitive studies to address this issue have not been performed."  The Court then held that if the Board finds that a medical text that serves as the basis for a medical opinion contains apparent qualifiers or contradictions, or if the veteran raises the issue or it is reasonably raised from review of the evidence of record, the Board must address that issue and explain whether those aspects of the medical text diminish the probative value of the medical opinion evidence or render the opinion inadequate, and if not, why not. McCray, 31 Vet. App. at 257.

Upon review of the record, the June 2023, VA examiner relied solely on the 2006 IOM report as a basis for providing a negative opinion. However, as noted above the 2006 IOM report has qualifying or contradictory statements.  The Board finds that without additional evidence or medical rationale, this opinion provided is inadequate to deny the Veteran's claim of bilateral hearing loss.

In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed all evidence of record whether or not discussed in detail. See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal).

The probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion that the physician reaches.  Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993).  Whether a physician provides a basis for a medical opinion goes to the weight or credibility of the evidence in the adjudication of the merits.  See Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998).  Other factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims folder and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000); Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000).

Here, the July 2021, opinion was provided by a VA medical professional who possesses the necessary education, training, and expertise to provide the requested opinions.  Additionally, the opinion is also shown to have been based on a review of the Veteran's record and is accompanied by a sufficient explanation as to why the Veteran's hearing loss would be related to active-duty service.  The Board thus places more probative weight on the July 2021, medical opinion.

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.
