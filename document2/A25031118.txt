ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper extremities is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has not a had a diagnosis of bilateral upper extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy during the appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper extremities has not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from May 1983 to April 1988 and in the Army from June 1988 to September 1992.  This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 higher level review of a June 2023 rating decision from a Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, and requested the AMA direct docket review.  Under the rules of the AMA, the Board's review is limited to the evidence associated with the claims file as of the date of the June 2023 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

As a final matter, evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the claim, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral upper extremity neuropathy.

As a matter of procedural history, the Veteran filed a claim for entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II (DM) in May 2018.  The claim was denied in an August 2018 rating decision.  In April 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for entitlement to service connection for DM.  The claim was adjudicated by the RO in a June 2023 rating decision, and included denials for diabetes as well as multiple diabetic complications, to include diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities.  The Veteran sought higher level review of that decision, and the RO issued the October 2023 rating decision finding that a duty to assist error had occurred, such that additional development was required for the claims for diabetes and associated complications of bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy. However, no such error was found for the claims for bilateral upper extremity peripheral neuropathy. Rather, the higher level review continued the June 2023 denials.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Generally, service connection requires three elements: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Sheddon v. Principi, 381 F.3d. 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

A disability that is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury shall be service connected.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

In deciding the Veteran's claim, the VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event; or whether the persuasive evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.S. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.

As to the first element required for service connection, the Veteran must show a current disability.  In May 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA medical examination to determine whether he has a diabetic neuropathy disability.  The examiner opined that the Veteran does not have bilateral upper extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  

Upon review of the Veteran's medical treatment records, it is documented that he does experience the symptoms of pain, numbness, and tingling in his bilateral upper extremity.  Specifically, on December 13, 2017, an orthopedic surgery note documented the Veteran has had multiple year history of left shoulder pain and that over the last year, he also noted right shoulder pain; that the Veteran reported pain is worsening; that he was in physical therapy; that the pain started when he was on active duty; that he does remember a time when he was lifting something heavy and it fell while he was trying to catch it; denies any history of dislocation, and; he never sought treatment for it as his symptoms improved.  See VBMS, document labeled CAPRI, receipt date 2/2/2019, page 206 of 323.  There is another orthopedic surgery outpatient note on March 16, 2018, which documents the Veteran's cervical spine has decreased range of motion with reproduction of symptoms to the right, and that the Veteran notes numb tingly sensation radiates throughout the arm to his fingertips.  This was assessed as cervical radiculopathy of the right side.  See VBMS, document labeled CAPRI, receipt date 4/20/2022, page 790 of 984.  On April 19, 2018, another orthopedic surgery outpatient note documents the Veteran is experiencing pain in his right shoulder and arm are most likely due to cervical spine issues, and that he notes radiation of pain from the neck to his fingers along with numb, tingling sensation.  This was assessed as right shoulder impingement syndrome.  See VBMS, document labeled CAPRI, receipt date 4/20/2022, page 753 of 984.  A short stay unit (SSU) patient assessment on January 25, 2019 documents the Veteran experienced tingling in his left hand.  See VBMS, document labeled CAPRI, receipt date 2/2/2019, page 35 of 323.  A SSU notation on September 24, 2019 documents the Veteran experiences numbness and tingling in his hands and feet.  See VBMS, document labeled CAPRI, receipt date 4/20/2022, page 375 of 984.  A December 2, 2019 pharmacotherapy note documents the Veteran has pain daily in his shoulder and knee mostly, but also tingling in feet or pain back.  

On this evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremities. The evidence demonstrates that any currently diagnosed neurological disability of the upper extremities is linked to a non-service-connected cervical spine disability. The Board recognizes that the scope of a claim pursued by a claimant includes any diagnosis that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). However, in this case, the Veteran did not bring a claim for neurological symptoms in his upper extremities.  Rather, he brought a claim for diabetes, and the Regional Office properly sought to discover whether he had any associated complications of that disability when it was service-connected.  Therefore, Clemons is inapplicable to this case.  The Board finds the Diabetic Sensory Examination conducted in May 2023 specifically explored whether the Veteran had diabetic peripheral neuropathy and found that he did not.  The Board finds this examination highly probative, especially when viewed in conjunction with the treatment records that note neurological symptoms due to an orthopedic disability.  Therefore, the Board finds that in the absence of a diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the claim for service connection must be denied.

As the evidence is not in relative equipoise, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
