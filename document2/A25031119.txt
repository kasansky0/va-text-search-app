DOCKET NO. 240627-451073

ORDER

An effective date earlier than September 26, 2016 for the grant of service connection for the cause of death is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Appellant's initial Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) claim was received by VA on September 26, 2016.

2. Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death was granted pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), as the evidence shows the Veteran served in Thailand and that his coronary artery disease, a disease presumed to be related to herbicide exposure, likely contributed to his death.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 26, 2016 for the grant of service connection for the cause of death have not been met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 1305, 1310, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.33, 3.114, 3.152, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1966 to June 1969. He died in August 2016. The Appellant is his surviving spouse. 

In May 2023, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a March 2023 rating decision that granted service connection for cause of the Veteran's death, effective August 10, 2022. In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2023 decision. 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the direct review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for the cause of death

In the March 2023 decision that is subject to higher-level review, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for cause of death, effective August 10, 2022. The AOJ noted the Veteran served in Thailand and that his coronary artery disease likely contributed to his death and, thus, awarded service connection for cause of the Veteran's death pursuant to the PACT Act. 

In this context, the Board notes that, on August 10, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) which, as relevant to this case, expanded the presumption of exposure to herbicides to veterans who served in Thailand.

Generally, claims granted under the PACT Act will be effective no earlier than August 10, 2022, the date the PACT Act was enacted. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114, 3.400(p). As a result, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for cause of the Veteran's death, effective August 10, 2022. 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, the Appellant expressed disagreement with the effective date assigned and essentially argued that the effective date should be May 12, 2017, as she had continuously pursued the cause of death claim since that date. See August 2024 Representative statement. 

While this appeal was pending, VA conducted a special review of the Appellant's claim and awarded an earlier effective date of September 26, 2016 for the claim of service connection for cause of the Veteran's death, the date of the Appellant's previously denied claim. See January 2025 Notification letter. 

In this regard, the PACT Act directs VA to assign effective dates "as if the establishment or modification of the presumption of service connection had been in effect on the date of the submission of the original claim." 38 U.S.C. § 1305(a)(3). On January 23, 2024, VA amended its adjudication regulations concerning DIC awards to provide for the reevaluation of certain previously denied DIC claims in accordance with the provisions of the PACT Act. The amended regulation specifically provides that the effective date of any award for a re-evaluated DIC claim shall be determined as if the presumption of service connection had been in effect on the date the original claim was filed. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.33(d). 

In this case, review of the record shows that the Appellant filed her initial DIC claim, to include service connection for cause of the Veteran's death, on September 26, 2016 but re-submitted the claim on May 12, 2017. The claim of service connection for cause of the Veteran's death was denied in a July 2017 rating decision, which the Appellant appealed, and the claim was eventually granted in the March 2023 rating decision. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the earliest possible effective date for the grant of service connection for cause of the Veteran's death is the date of receipt of the Appellant's original claim, i.e., September 26, 2016, which is the date currently assigned. 

In the request for a higher level review, the appellant indicated that she was seeking an effective date of May 12, 2017. The currently assigned September 26, 2016 date precedes the requested date and the evidence does not suggest, and the appellant has not alleged, that an effective date prior to September 2016 is warranted. 

There is no basis in the law to award the benefit prior to the date of receipt of the Appellant's original claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.33(d), 3.400. As such, the appeal is denied.
