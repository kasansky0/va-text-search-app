DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for chronic sinusitis is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has qualifying service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations and is presumed to have been exposed to fine particulate matter during such service.

2. The Veteran has a current diagnosis of chronic sinusitis. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.320.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1998 to January 2011, including service in Kuwait and Iraq. See September 2023 Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected to appeal the issue listed above and requested a direct review of the evidence considered by the RO. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. § 20.303.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis

Generally, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Effective August 5, 2021, VA amended its regulations to establish a presumption of service connection for veterans who have a qualifying period of service and certain respiratory conditions, i.e., asthma, rhinitis and sinusitis, to include rhinosinusitis, that become manifest to any degree (including non-compensable) at any time following separation from military service. See 86 Fed. Reg. 42724 (August 5, 2021). A qualifying period of service exists if a veteran served on active duty in the Southwest Asia theater of operations (i.e., Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, and the airspace above these locations) during the Persian Gulf War or in Afghanistan, Syria, Djibouti or Uzbekistan on or after September 19, 2001 during the Persian Gulf War. Id. at 41,732-33 (codified at 38 C.F.R. § 3.320).

Under the provision, exposure to fine particulate matter is presumed unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to fine particulate matter during service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 (a). 

On August 10, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law, Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 or the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 (PACT Act), Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (Aug. 10, 2022) (codified at 38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120).

In relevant part, the PACT Act now provides that "covered veterans," including those who performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in while assigned to a duty station in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, or United Arab Emirates on or after August 2, 1990, are presumed to have been exposed to substances, chemicals, and airborne hazards, including burn pits or toxic substances (BPOTs), as part of their service unless there is affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 U.S.C. § 1119(c). Furthermore, the PACT Act states that Veterans who were exposed to BPOTs specifically during the Gulf War and post-9/11 eras are eligible for presumptive service connection if they have a current diagnosis of several enumerated disabilities, including chronic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pub. L. No. 117-168, Title IV, § 406(b), 136 Stat. 1759, 1784; 38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120.

As noted in the Introduction, the evidence shows the Veteran served in Kuwait from July to December 2007. Indeed, in the November 2023 decision, the AOJ noted that the Veteran's participation in toxic exposure related activity (TERA), including burn pit exposure, is presumed, given his service in Kuwait and Iraq. Therefore, the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to environmental hazards, to include BPOTs, and the presumptions of service connection due to exposure to fine particulate matter, BPOTs, and under the PACT Act are applicable in this case. 

The remaining question is if there is a competent diagnosis of chronic sinusitis of record. 

In support of his claim, the Veteran submitted private medical records which reflect that, between 2016 and 2021, he was treated for allergies and cold symptoms that were variously diagnosed as acute maxillary sinusitis and an upper respiratory infection. Notably, a January 2019 nasal endoscopy revealed findings consistent with and interpreted as chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and deviated septum. At that time, the examining clinician noted that the Veteran's chronic sinusitis was manifested by persistent nasal congestion.  

The Veteran was afforded two VA sinusitis examinations in conjunction with this claim, including in October and November 2023. The clinicians who performed the examinations did not render a current diagnosis of chronic sinusitis or any other sinus, nose, throat, larynx, or pharynx condition listed on the disability benefits questionnaire. In this regard, both examiners noted that sinus x-rays taken on the day of each examination were normal and did not reveal any significant abnormality, and it appears that the examiners based their conclusion that there was no current disability on this evidence. 

Notably, neither VA examiner addressed the private medical records or the previous diagnosis of chronic sinusitis of record. The Board also notes that the November 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's current symptoms included sinus pain and pressure, headaches, nasal congestion, and a runny nose and further noted that the Veteran's last sinus infection was two months before. However, the VA examiner but did not address if the Veteran's current symptoms were attributable to a diagnosis or indicate if the symptoms were manifestations of the previous diagnosis of chronic sinusitis. 

The Board finds that the foregoing deficiencies render the October and November 2023 VA examinations inadequate and, as a result, they are afforded minimal probative weight. Nevertheless, the Board finds that the diagnosis of chronic sinusitis reflected in the January 2019 private treatment record is a competent medical diagnosis sufficient to establish the presence of the currently claimed disability. 

The Board recognizes that the Court has held that the presence of a chronic disability at any time during or immediately preceding the claims process can justify a grant of service connection, even where the most recent diagnosis is negative. See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013) (holding the current disability requirement may be satisfied by evidence of the disability shortly before the claim is filed). 

In this case, the Board acknowledges that the diagnosis of chronic sinusitis was rendered approximately four years prior to the filing of this claim and was not confirmed by recent imaging. However, the Board finds probative that the Veteran was noted to have to the same primary symptom of chronic sinusitis, i.e., persistent nasal congestion, during the November 2023 VA examination and was also noted to have had a sinus infection no more than two months before the examination, which suggests recurrent and persistent symptoms of the claimed disability which, in turn, supports a finding of chronicity.   

Therefore, after resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds the Veteran has a current diagnosis of chronic sinusitis. 

Accordingly, because the Veteran has a documented diagnosis of chronic sinusitis and is presumed to have been exposed to fine particulate matter during his period of active service, the Veteran's sinusitis is presumed to be related to such exposure. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320. As such, service connection for sinusitis as presumptively related to in-service exposure to fine particulate matter is warranted.
