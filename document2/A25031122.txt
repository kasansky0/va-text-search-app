REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a skin condition, to include dermatofibroma is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the Navy from June 1971 to March 1972. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for a skin condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for a skin condition, to include dermatofibroma is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a skin condition, to include dermatofibroma is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the January 2024 rating decision on appeal. The Veteran claimed that his condition is due to in-service herbicide exposure due to his military occupational specialty (MOS) as an aircraft mechanic. See September 2022 Statement. The AOJ obtained a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum in April 2023, which concluded that the Veteran had no TERA in service. However, this memorandum is unsigned. See April 2023 TERA Memorandum (employee signature left blank). As such, it is invalid, and a new one must be obtained to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain the Veteran's ILER and a TERA Memorandum. Thereafter, readjudicate the claims for service connection for a skin condition, to include dermatofibroma.
