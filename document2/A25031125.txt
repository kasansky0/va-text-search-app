ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for heart conditions, to include congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD), is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

Erectile dysfunction was not shown in service or for many years thereafter, and there is no evidence that the Veteran's current erectile dysfunction is related to his service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for erectile dysfunction have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1969 to May 1971.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the October 30, 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran timely appealed the September 2023 rating decision and elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on December 12, 2024.  A transcript of the hearing is of record.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for heart conditions, to include congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy with AICD, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

In November 2024, the Board notified the Veteran that the appeal has been placed on the docket.  Thus, the appeal is properly before the Board, and this decision follows.

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is denied.

The Veteran contends that he has erectile dysfunction due to his military service.  In general, service connection may be granted for a disability or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  To prevail on a direct service connection claim, there must be competent evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection may also be established by credible lay evidence and medical evidence provided by the Veteran or otherwise.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection is also warranted for disability proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Such secondary service connection is warranted for any increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b).

Presumptive service connection can also be established based on herbicide agent exposure for certain diseases. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6).  If a veteran is presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents or the evidence with respect to exposure is at least in equipoise, the veteran is entitled to a presumption of service connection for disabilities listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e).  The presumptive exposure is only applicable to veterans who served in the Republic of Vietnam from January 1962 to May 1975, operated in or near the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) from April 1968 to August 1971, or were regularly operating, maintaining, or serving aboard C-123 aircraft known to have been used to spray an herbicide agent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(iii), (iv), and (v).  The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) recently expanded the presumption of in-service herbicide agent exposure to include service in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Guam, American Samoa, and Johnston Atoll.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1116(d).  Under the AMA, any favorable finding made by AOJ is binding on the Board unless it can be rebutted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

The AOJ found that a VA examination dated June 28, 2023 diagnosed the Veteran with erectile dysfunction with varicocele/hydrocele.  See September 2024 Rating Decision.  Additionally, the AOJ conceded that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity based on his deployment to Vietnam.  Id.; see also June 2023 Memorandum.  These findings are not rebutted.  Therefore, Board finds the Veteran has a diagnosed disability of erectile dysfunction and has presumptive exposure to herbicide agents.    

Although the Board finds the Veteran has presumptive exposure to herbicide agents during his military service, the Board finds that presumptive service connection for erectile dysfunction, based on herbicide agent exposure, is not warranted.  Erectile dysfunction is not a listed disability associated with exposure to herbicide agents.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).  Therefore, presumptive service connection based on herbicide agent exposure is not warranted for the Veteran's erectile dysfunction.

For conditions not presumptively service connected, a claimant is not precluded from establishing service connection with proof of direct causation.  Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (noting that presumptive service connection "does not foreclose proof of direct service connection"); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The first element has been satisfied as the AOJ found the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability of erectile dysfunction with varicocele/hydrocele.  See September 2024 Rating Decision.  This finding is not rebutted and binding on the Board.

As to the second element of service connection (an in-service injury, disease, or event), the only in-service injury, disease, or event that meets the second element of direct service connection is the Veteran's presumed exposure to herbicide agents.  Shedden, 381 F.3d 1163.  During the December 2024 Hearing, the Veteran asserted that his erectile dysfunction was due to his exposure to herbicide agents.  The Veteran's service treatment records are silent to complaints, diagnoses, or treatments for erectile dysfunction during his service.  The Veteran has not indicated that the condition had its onset during service or that he began experiencing symptoms related to the condition during service.  Therefore, the first two elements of service connection are satisfied.  Shedden, 381 F.3d 1163.

Accordingly, the key the key inquiry is whether there is a causal relationship between the Veteran's erectile dysfunction and the Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents.  The evidence of record does not support that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was related to his military service.  

To that end, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination on June 22, 2023 and filed June 28, 2023.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with erectile dysfunction and varicocele/hydrocele that began in 2003 after pulmonary embolus and antiphospholipid antibody.  See June 28, 2023 VA Examination.  The Veteran is not service connected for pulmonary embolus and antiphospholipid antibody; thus, secondary service connection for erectile dysfunction is not warranted.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was less likely than not caused by herbicide exposure, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.  Id.  As rationale, the examiner stated that erectile dysfunction has may causes including physical and psychological.  Id.  

The examiner listed risk factors that include old age, chronic pain, depression, hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, low testosterone levels, alcohol, tobacco, and lack of physical exercise.  Id.  The examiner noted that no medical or scientific evidence available provided any indication of a relationship between the condition at issue and the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activity.  Id.  As the June 28, 2023 VA medical opinion was based on the full consideration of all pertinent medical evidence of record and is supported by sufficient reasons for conclusions offered, the Board assigns it some probative weight.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran stated that he had a private urologist treating his condition.  The Board notes that treatments from the urologist was first raised in the record at the December 2024 Hearing and after the September 2023 decision on appeal.  As the existence of treatment records from the urologist was not reasonably raised by the record prior to the September 2023 rating decision, the Board does not have the authority to order additional development pertaining to the records from the urologist.  The Veteran did not submit additional evidence, to include urology medical records, within the 90-day evidence window following the December 12, 2024 Hearing, which would be March 12, 2025.  Thus, the Board will proceed to adjudicate this issue based on the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).  Upon review, there is no competent medical evidence that contradicts the June 28, 2023 VA examination.  As such, the Board assigns significant probative weight to the June 28, 2023 VA examination.  Accordingly, the Board finds the record of evidence does not support the claim for direct service connection for erectile dysfunction. 

The absence of any clinical evidence of the claimed disability for decades after service weighs the evidence against a finding that the Veteran's disability is causally connected to his military service, particularly as the Veteran had not alleged the onset of the disability during service.  Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2000); see also Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 239 (2012).  The evidence of record documents that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction began in 2003, more than three decades after his military service, and weighs against finding that the Veteran's condition is causally connected to his military service.

The Board recognizes the Veteran's contention that his condition is related to his service; however, the record does not support, nor does the Veteran suggest, that he has specialized education, training, or experience that would qualify him to provide an opinion as to the etiology of his erectile dysfunction.  While the Veteran is competent to report what he had experienced, he is not competent to ascertain the etiology of his condition as the causative factors for such are not readily subject to lay observation.  Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007).

In sum, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is related to his military service.  Therefore, entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is not warranted.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The appeal is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for heart conditions, congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he has heart conditions, to include congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy with AICD, due to his military service.  Service treatment records are silent to complaints, treatments, or diagnoses related to the Veteran's congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy with AICD, indicating the Veteran did not have the disability while on active duty.  The Veteran's medical treatment records document the Veteran's congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy with AICD.  See September 16, 2021 Medical Treatment Record.

On May 27, 203, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination filed on September 5, 2023.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had been diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 2021, bradycardia in 2021, AICD in 2022, valvular heart disease in 2022, cardiomyopathy in 2023, and pulmonary hypertension in 2023, bradycardia and valvular heart disease in 2021, and premature ventricular contractions in 2003.  See September 5, 2023 VA Examination.  In Section II - Medical History, the examiner noted under heart condition #2 "pulmonary hypertension-hypertension" and under additional heart conditions "PVCs-hypertension."  The Board is unable to determine whether the examiner formally diagnosed the Veteran with hypertension.  Additionally, the examiner did not provide a nexus opinion on the Veteran's diagnosed heart conditions.  As the AOJ did not obtain an addendum to correct these deficiencies at the time of the decision on appeal, such was a pre-decisional duty to assist error; a remand is necessary to correct it.

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate examiner.  A copy of this remand request should be provided.  If the examiner determines it is necessary, schedule the Veteran for an in-person examination for the Veteran's heart conditions.  The examiner must confirm diagnoses for any heart conditions, to include hypertension, and opine whether such diagnoses are due to the Veteran's military service.

The examiner is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions reached.  The examiner is reminded that the term "as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility," but rather that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher.  Note that the lack of documented treatment in service, or a long period after, while probative, cannot serve as the sole basis for a negative finding.  The Veteran's lay contentions must be considered and weighed in making the determination.

All pertinent evidence, including both lay and medical, should be considered.  If an opinion cannot be given without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why and state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

2. After ensuring full compliance with this remand, readjudicate the claim on appeal.
