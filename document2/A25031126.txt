ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected left knee degenerative arthritis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran failed to report for VA examinations scheduled in conjunction with his claims for an increased rating for bilateral knee disability and has not provided good cause for his failure to report.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1988 to February 1993, to include service to Southwest Asia.

In an August 2023 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for tinnitus and increased ratings for bilateral knee arthritis and allergic rhinitis. In September 2023, the Veteran filed for higher-level review. The August 2023 decision was confirmed in January 2024. In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected left knee degenerative arthritis.

See section 3 below.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected right knee degenerative arthritis.

See section 3 below.

3. Entitlement to a compensable rating for service-connected allergic rhinitis.

The Veteran filed for increased ratings for his bilateral knee arthritis and allergic rhinitis. See April 2023 Fully developed claim. He did not provide any reasoning as to why he felt his conditions had worsened with his claim.

In May 2023, the AOJ notified the Veteran they were working to schedule an examination for his claims. He was informed that failure to report for an examination without providing good cause will result in the claim being rated on the evidence of record or denial. That month, his examinations were cancelled. See May 2023 Exam Request. The exam request noted the cancellations were done at the Veteran's request. Id. In support of the cancellation request, it noted the Veteran was very upset at attempts to schedule appointments and he did not want to drive to Illinois even though the appointments were 14 miles apart. Id. The Veteran reportedly stated he was done with QTC and the VA as no one wanted to work with his schedule. Id.

The AOJ notified the Veteran in a May 2023 subsequent development letter they were informed of the canceled examinations. The AOJ informed the Veteran he was welcome to provide good cause or a time frame of availability to reschedule the examinations. Id. The AOJ requested the Veteran notify them if he does not intend to complete his examinations. Id. Finally, the AOJ informed the Veteran that if they did not hear from him, his clam would be decided on the evidence of record. Id. The Veteran's representative was provided a copy of the letter. Id. 

There are no complaints for knee or allergic rhinitis one year prior to or during the Veteran's appeal period in VA treatment records and the Veteran has not submitted private medical records.

When entitlement or continued entitlement to a benefit cannot be established or confirmed without a current VA examination or reexamination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination, or reexamination, action shall be taken in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section as appropriate. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant, death of an immediate family member, etc. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a).

When a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with an original compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. When the examination was scheduled in conjunction with any other original claim, a supplemental claim for a benefit which was previously disallowed, or a claim for increase, the claim shall be denied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

As the Veteran cancelled the examinations and did not try to reschedule them with the AOJ or its contractor, a good cause exemption is not found. Furthermore, the Board notes that the duty to assist is not a one-way street. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991).

Under these circumstances, the Board finds that because the Veteran cancelled his examinations and did not attempt to reschedule those examinations with the AOJ, action will be taken in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

Specifically, the claims for increased ratings for the bilateral knee arthritis and allergic rhinitis must be denied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b). 

4. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran contends he is experiencing ringing in his ears. See April 2023 fully developed claim.

The Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) was Combat Engineer. As such, the AOJ conceded noise exposure.

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that is related to service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). For VA purposes, tinnitus has been specifically found to be a disorder with symptoms that can be identified through lay observation alone. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).

Here, there is no VA examination as the Veteran cancelled his examination in May 2023. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's current tinnitus is related to service. 

Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for tinnitus is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
