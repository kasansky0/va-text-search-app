DOCKET NO. 240516-440442
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's PTSD is at least as likely as not related to his in-service stressor.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for PTSD are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 2011 to May 2012 and from May 2020 to June 2020, with additional service in the Army National Guard.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued on January 29, 2024, by a Department of Veterans (VA) Regional Office, herein referred to as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), under the modernized review system known as the Appeal Modernization Act (AMA).

In May 2024, the Veteran filed a timely Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) in which he elected the direct review docket. Consequently, the Board's review is limited to the evidence at the time of the issuance of the January 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that the Veteran included issues pertaining to right shoulder arthritis adjudicated in a March 2022 rating decision, and issues pertaining to left ankle arthritis, left hand arthritis, and left knee arthritis, left shoulder arthritis, a low back condition, right ankle arthritis, arthritis of the right hand, and right knee arthritis adjudicated in a December 2021 rating decision. However, the May 2024 VA Form 10182 is untimely as to such decisions. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.302 (a). Where a VA Form 10182 is not timely filed, the Board may grant an extension of time and accept the VA Form 10182 as timely where good cause is shown. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203 (c). In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran requested an extension to such issues, stating that he did not see the letter as his previous roommate/ex-wife opened the letter. Additionally, he also submitted mobilization orders with orders to active duty beginning on January 25, 2024. While he did not indicate that such was in support of his request for an extension, the Board infers it to be so. However, the Board finds that good cause has not been shown in this case. Specifically, there is no evidence that the rating decisions were marked as undeliverable, and they were sent to the Veteran's representative. Additionally, the mobilization orders were dated more than one year following the issuance of the rating decisions. Consequently, good cause has not been shown and the Veteran's request for an extension as to such issues must be denied.  

Entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d). Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. Id.; see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) [(table)].

For PTSD, service connection requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a), a link, established by medical evidence between current symptoms and an in-service stressor, and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f). 

If a veteran has received a diagnosis of PTSD from a competent medical professional, VA will assume that the diagnosis was made in accordance with the appropriate psychiatric criteria in regard to the adequacy of the symptomatology and the sufficiency of the stressor. Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 153 (1997). Nevertheless, VA may reject the claim on a finding that the evidence is persuasively against (1) the PTSD diagnosis, (2) the occurrence of the in-service stressor, or (3) the connection of the current condition to the in-service stressor. The adequacy of a stressor, sufficiency of symptomatology, and diagnosis are all medical determinations. See Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 143-44.

Of particular note here, if a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f)(1).

For these purposes, "fear of hostile military or terrorist activity" means that a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, such as from incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; a grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or an attack upon friendly military aircraft; and the veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f)(3).

The Veteran contends that he currently has PTSD as a result of his service in Southwest Asia. In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran served in Kuwait and Iraq during his period of deployment from July 2011 to May 2012. Specifically, in an August 2023 Statement in Support of Claim for PTSD (VA Form 21-0781a), he indicated that he experiences episodes of temper, panic attacks, and anxiety without an identifiable cause, obsessive behaviors, hypervigilance, increased isolation, temper, and difficulties with relationships. 

In the January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD finding that the record did not reflect a current diagnosis and that the Veteran failed to appear for a scheduled VA examination. In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination in September 2023, which he failed to appear for. However, he subsequently requested to reschedule the examination, stating that he did not receive notice of his September 2023 VA examination. 

Accordingly, the Veteran was rescheduled for a VA examination in January 2024, prior to the issuance of the rating decision on appeal, and the examination was conducted via video telehealth. The Board notes that the AOJ failed to address the examination in the January 2024 rating decision when adjudicating the Veteran's claim. 

At the January 2024 VA examination, the examiner determined that the Veteran meets the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under DSM-5 and noted a diagnosis of a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Veteran reported that during his deployment, he witnessed a 5-year-old child get run over, he regularly experienced mortar attacks, he was under the threat of IED attacks, and he was on convoy missions on a daily basis. In the opinion, the examiner indicated that the Veteran experienced multiple traumatic events in Kuwait and Iraq which meet the requirements for Criteria A for PTSD. Additionally, he meets the full DSM-V diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Therefore, it is at least as likely as not that his PTSD was caused by in-service events. 

The Board recognizes that the Veteran's reported stressors have not yet been officially verified by VA; however, it finds significant the fact that the VA examiner who personally interviewed the Veteran found his reports credible and rendered a positive nexus opinion. This opinion has great probative value. Accordingly, while the stressors in question here are based on the Veteran's lay testimony alone, they are consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service, and they are not contradicted by other evidence of record. They are therefore credible, and the Board finds that the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors has been reasonably established. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f)(1).

Therefore, as the January 2024 VA examiner, a psychologist, considered all relevant acts and offered a rationale for the opinion provided, the Board resolves all doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds that his PTSD is related to his military service.  Notably, there is no opinion to the contrary. 

Thus, service connection for PTSD is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
