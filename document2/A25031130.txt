ORDER

The appeal as to the issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided on March 19, 2021, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

A VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) was received from a revenue cycle management company that did not furnish the underlying non-VA medical services in question.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

A complete NOD requesting review by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) of the issue of entitlement to payment or reimbursement of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on March 19, 2021, has not been received; the appeal is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army from December 1971 to November 1988.  He died on September [REDACTED] 2022.  The appellant in this case is a revenue cycle management company attempting to obtain payment for non-VA medical services provided to the Veteran by Baptist Memorial Hospital-Union County on March 19, 2021.

This appeal before the Board arose from an April 2021 determination that payment or reimbursement of medical expenses incurred on March 19, 2021, at Baptist Memorial Hospital-Union County could not be made because no authorization number was submitted on the claim, which is a billing requirement for pre-approved care.  

On November 20, 2021, the Board received a VA Form 10182 (NOD) from "Benefit Recovery" in which the Direct Review docket was elected.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

In the instant case, the Board finds "Benefit Recovery" is not a proper claimant that may file an NOD in response to the denial of the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.204 (an NOD may be filed by a claimant or by his or her representative if a proper Power of Attorney is on record or accompanies such NOD).

Notably, "claimant" is generally defined under VA regulations as a person who filed a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 20.3(f), (g).  Under Part 17 of the regulations, claimants for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical services for unauthorized emergency treatment may include the veteran who received the services; the hospital, clinic, or community resource which provided the services; or a person other than the veteran who paid for the services.  38 C.F.R. § 17.123.  When viewed in the context of authorized non-VA medical services, health care providers include entities authorized to furnish medical services to covered veterans that enter into bid contracts to establish networks of health care providers.  See generally 38 U.S.C. § 1703(c), (h); 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4005, 17.4030.  There is no indication under the applicable law and regulations that a non-veteran entity that did not furnish the underlying medical services may be considered a claimant.

The record does not reflect that "Benefit Recovery" is a health care provider as described in the regulations or that "Benefit Recovery" provided the underlying treatment on March 19, 2021, associated with a claim for payment for the non-VA medical services.  Moreover, "Benefit Recovery" is not a representative of the Veteran or Baptist Memorial Hospital-Union County.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.627, 14.629.

Therefore, the November 2021 VA Form 10182 filed by "Benefit Recovery" did not initiate appellate review.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(a), (b)(2)(A) (an NOD shall be in writing, shall identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees, and may be filed by the claimant, the claimant's legal guardian, or such accredited representative, attorney, or authorized agent as may be selected by the claimant or legal guardian.); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202(a), 20.204.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
