DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 14, 2021 for a 100 percent disability rating for coronary artery disease is granted.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus type II is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his coronary artery disease manifested as a workload of 3.0 METs or less and resulted in heart failure symptoms throughout the appeal period.

2. The probative evidence is against finding that the Veteran's diabetes manifests as requiring one or more daily injections of insulin, and regulation of activities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 14, 2021 for a 100 percent disability rating for coronary artery disease have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.400, 4.3, 4.7, 4.14, 4.21, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7005.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus type II have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from January 1969 to December 1971. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of the October 2022 and March 2023 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the July 5, 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on November 21, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 and March 2023 RO decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the RO issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As a preliminary matter the Board acknowledges that on September 1, 2022, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement for earlier effective dates and increased disability ratings appealing the August 16, 2022 and August 20, 2022 rating decisions. This decision will only focus on claims that were specifically appealed from the October 2022 and March 2023 rating decisions, in the July 5, 2023 Notice of Disagreement, any ancillary disability such as earlier effective dates for service connection or complications of diabetes will not be discussed in this decision, as these claims will be addressed in a separate Board decision.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with regard to the duty to notify or duty to assist as they pertain to the issues considered in this decision. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361  (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

The analysis in this decision focuses on the most relevant evidence and on what the evidence shows or does not show with respect to the issues denied in this decision. The Veteran should not assume that evidence that is not explicitly discussed in this decision has been overlooked. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (noting that the law requires only that reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant be addressed).

INCREASED RATINGS

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Schedule, but that findings sufficient to identify the disease and the resulting disability and, above all, coordination of the rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21; see also Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).

When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings," in all claims for increased ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999).

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 14, 2021 for a 100 percent disability rating for coronary artery disease 

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date prior to September 15, 2022 for a 100 percent disability rating for his coronary artery disease. The applicable rating period is from January 14, 2021, the effective date of service connection for that disability, through the present. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Veteran's service-connected coronary artery disease is currently rated at 30 percent under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7005, which pertains to arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease).

Prior to November 14, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7005, for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) a 10 percent rating is warranted where a workload of greater than 7.0 metabolic equivalents (METs) but not greater than 10.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; continuous medication is required. A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of greater than 5.0 METs but not greater than 7.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray. A 60 percent rating is warranted where there is more than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in the past year, or; a workload of greater than 3.0 METs but not greater than 5.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent. A 100 percent rating is warranted where there is chronic congestive heart failure, or; a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent.

From November 14, 2021, revised criteria, DC 7005 provides that: A 30 percent rating contemplates a workload of 5.1 to 7.0 METs resulting in heart failure symptoms; or there is evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilation confirmed by an echocardiogram or the equivalent (e.g., multi-gated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging). A 60 percent rating contemplates where a workload of 3.1 to 5.0 METs result in heart failure symptoms. A 100 percent rating contemplates where a workload of 3.0 METs or less result in heart failure symptoms.

One MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. When the level of METs at which breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, a medical examiner may estimate the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in those symptoms. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2). Heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope. Id. at Note (3).

In the August 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection for coronary artery disease (claimed as heart condition to include atrial fibrillation) associated with herbicide exposure), at a 30 percent disability rating, effective January 14, 2021. The RO acknowledged that VA Healthcare records noted overlapping comorbidities, and an examination would be required to determine the current severity of the Veteran's coronary artery disease.

In September 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for heart conditions. The examiner indicated that the Veteran had diagnoses of coronary heart disease, AFib, and mitral valve insufficiency. The examiner noted that the Veteran was not a great historian, and was not able to contribute much concerning his diagnosis. The examiner indicated that the Veteran interviewed-based METs test revealed that the Veteran's met level was 1-3 METs, which is consistent with activities such as eating, dressing, taking a shower, slow walking (2 mph) for 1-2 blocks. The Veteran's symptoms during activity include breathlessness, fatigue, and angina.

In November 2024, the Veteran testified at a Board hearing. He testified that he would have to sit down halfway through a visit to the hardware store, and has had that level of fatigue since 2000. When he was trucking, he would at times need to pull over and lay down for 15-20 minutes. The Veteran testified that his current problem of getting "a terrible vibration." Feels like chairs are vibrating. The Veteran's spouse testified that they think it is related to back problem. The Veteran would get dizzy and fall off trailer if he tried to tarp a truck load himself, so started paying someone to do it for him. The Veteran's representative noted that there is "quite a bit of a history of that kind of dizziness" shown in the medical treatment records.

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that a 100 percent disability rating is warranted throughout the appeal period, and the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date of January 14, 2021, for a 100 percent disability rating (which is the date the Veteran became service connected) for coronary heart disease. The Board notes that the first factually ascertainable evidence of the severity of the Veteran's condition is the September 2022 VA examination. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's statements that he has had fatigue for decades, but the medical evidence within the record does not demonstrate the Veteran's level of impairment until the September 2022 VA examination, and the examiner noted that the Veteran was not a good historian. The Board also notes that this grant is for the appeal period before the Board, at this time of this decision, based on when the Veteran became service connected for coronary artery disease, and is thus a full grant of benefits.

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus type II 

The Veteran seeks a disability in excess of 20 percent for diabetes. The applicable rating period is from January 31, 2014, the effective date of service connection for that disability, through the present. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II, is currently rated at 20 from January 31, 2014 under 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913.

Diagnostic code 7913 provides a structured scheme of specific, successive, cumulative criteria. 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913. Each higher rating includes the same criteria as the lower rating plus distinct new criteria. Middleton v. Shinseki, 727 F.3d 1172, 1178 (Fed. Cir. 2013). A 10 percent rating is warranted when diabetes is manageable by restricted diet only. 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913. A 20 percent rating is warranted when diabetes requires one or more daily injection of insulin and restricted diet, or an oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet. Id. 

A 40 percent rating is warranted when it requires one or more daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities. Id. Regulation of activities is defined as avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities. Id. A 60 percent rating is warranted when diabetes requires one or more daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring one or two hospitalizations per year or twice a month visits to a diabetic care provider, plus complications that would not be compensable if separately evaluated. Id. A 100 percent rating is warranted when diabetes requires more than one daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities, with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring at least three hospitalizations per year or weekly visits to a diabetic care provider, plus either progressive loss of weight and strength or complications that would be compensable if separately evaluated. Id.

Compensable complications of diabetes are evaluated separately unless they are part of the criteria used to support a 100-percent evaluation. Noncompensable complications of diabetes are considered part of the diabetic process. 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913 (Note 1).

Because Diagnostic Code 7913 contains successive criteria, the criteria for the lower rating must be met before a higher disability rating may be awarded. A higher rating cannot be granted based on a finding that the Veteran's disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating. However, reasonable doubt regarding the presence of a criterion may be resolved in the Veteran's favor. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018).

Summary of Relevant Evidence

The Veteran's treatment records reflect that the Veteran has a diagnosis of diabetes, which is treated with Metformin. The Veteran's treatment records reflect that the Veteran is encouraged to exercise.

In September 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for diabetes.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran has a diagnosis of diabetes and was prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents as treatment. The examiner indicated that the Veteran was not required to regulate his activities as part of medical management of diabetes mellitus.  The Veteran receives care for his diabetes less than 2 times a month, and less than two times per month for hypoglycemia. The Veteran has not been hospitalized, and there is no unintentional weight loss.

In November 2024, the Veteran testified at a Board hearing. When asked if he was restricted from activities, the Veteran stated, "with my diabetes they had."  He then stated he has a new primary care doctor. He testified about the medications he was taking. The Veteran testified that "We're doing experimental cutbacks yet.  I'm down to about 11 pills, maybe ten.  And then it's my diabetes pill.  Yeah, I wasn't --I don't do needles, I don't do shots, none of that.  And he --they put me on pills."

The Board finds that a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's diabetes is not warranted. Specifically, the Board finds that the probative evidence is against finding that the Veteran has been restricted from activities as part of the medical management of the Veteran's diabetes, and the Veteran does not require one or more daily injections of insulin. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran noted that he was restricted, but the Veteran's treatment records reflect that the Veteran has been encouraged to exercise to build up strength, and to prevent falls. However, even if the Veteran was advised to regulate his activities, the Veteran does not require one or more daily injections of insulin. The Board acknowledges that the November 2024 VA examiner did not address the Veteran's neuropathy within the examination report, however the Veteran's own statements indicating that he does not take any shots [injections], demonstrates that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for a 40 percent disability rating. Thus, the Board finds that a disability rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's diabetes disability.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal in the veteran's favor, the claim must be denied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

In this case, the Board does not find that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, as the probative evidence is against finding that the Veteran's diabetes manifests as requiring one or more daily injections of insulin, and regulation of activities.

The Board also acknowledges that the Veteran testified in the November 2024 Board hearing that he has a new primary care doctor.  The Veteran is encouraged to file a supplemental claim if his diabetes becomes more severe, and requires one or more daily injections of insulin, and regulation of activities.
