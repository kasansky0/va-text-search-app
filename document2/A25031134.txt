ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for sarcoidosis is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for bradycardia is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's OSA is not etiologically related to service.

The Veteran's sarcoidosis is not etiologically related to service.

The Veteran's bradycardia is not etiologically related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for OSA have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for sarcoidosis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bradycardia have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1978 to July 1981 in addition to time in the Reserves.  He appeals a February 2024 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for OSA and an April 2024 rating decision denying service connection for sarcoidosis and bradycardia.  He opted for direct review of the evidence by this Board. 

Service Connection

Under the relevant laws and regulations, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a), 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310.  Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 505 (1995).

1. Entitlement to service connection for OSA.

The Veteran contends that his OSA is related to active service.  After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted.

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) does not show diagnosis, treatment, or complaints for any sleep conditions.  Indeed, the Veteran reported being "in good health", "currently taking no meds" at his 4-year Reserve examination in November 1982, over a year after separation from active service.  He was diagnosed with mild OSA in October 2023.

After service, the evidentiary record is silent regarding apnea symptoms prior to August 2023.  Furthermore, the evidence tends to show the onset and development of the Veteran's OSA began more than 30 years removed from active service.  In August 2023, the Veteran sought treatment for sleep disorder secondary to pain.  He was referred to the sleep clinic due to snoring and was diagnosed with sleep disordered breathing.  A sleep study was performed, and the Veteran was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea two months later.  As the record does not contain medical or lay evidence of sleep apnea symptoms during or until over 30 years removed from service, the Board finds that a continuity of symptoms has not been established based on the clinical evidence.

Moreover, to the extent that the Veteran has stated that he has experienced sleep apnea since service, the Board finds that service connection cannot be granted based solely on the Veteran's statements.  Specifically, the Board observes that the Veteran has filed claims prior to the one on appeal, which did not mention sleep apnea.  The fact that he was aware of the VA benefits system, sought out a claim for compensation related to other disorders, but made no reference to his sleep apnea weighs against his credibility. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 438 (2011).  Moreover, the Board cannot ignore that 36 years passed between the time he left active duty and the time he filed his claim.  Therefore, continuous symptoms is also not established based on his statements.  

As to nexus, the Board observes that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination specifically to his OSA claim.  However, given the lack of any in-service incident, illness, or injury to which the disability may be linked combined with the absence of evidence of symptoms for many years after separation from active service, the duty to assist does not require such development.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  Here, the evidence does not show the onset of the Veteran's OSA until many years after separation from active service.  As such, based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that a nexus has not been established for OSA.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the statements made by the Veteran regarding a relation between his OSA and active service.  However, in this case the Veteran is not competent to testify regarding the etiology of his OSA.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The diagnosis and evaluation of such a disorder requires the expertise of a qualified medical professional.  Therefore, the unsubstantiated statements made by the Veteran are found to lack competency.  As a result, service connection for OSA is not warranted. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for sarcoidosis.

3. Entitlement to service connection for bradycardia.

The Veteran contends that his sarcoidosis and bradycardia are related to service.  After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted.

As an initial matter, a review of the Veteran's STRs shows a heart condition was noted upon entrance to service.  However, there are no other indications of heart problems during the remainder of his three years of service such that the Board may conclude that a heart disorder either arose or was worsened by service.  It is true that the evidence does show evidence of chondritis on two occasions in December 1979, and May 1980.  However, the chondritis here was related to inflammation of the cartilage in the chest wall, and not a heart disorder per se.  Therefore, there is no indication that the Veteran had a heart disorder that began or was otherwise worsened in service. 

Similarly, the STRs also show an episode of pharyngitis in June 1980, following a cough that lasted for two days.  However, the Board is able to observe that the issue claimed on appeal, sarcoidosis, is a very separate and distinct disorder, even if both disorders are generally in the same area of the Body.  Therefore, there is also no indication that sarcoidosis was present in service.  

The first indication bradycardia since service was not until the Veteran was diagnosed in 1991, which also resulted in a pacemaker installation in 1999.  He not diagnosed with sarcoidosis until he underwent a lymph node biopsy in 1999.  Thus the earliest of either of these disorders was not present until approximately 10 years after he left service.  Indeed, the Veteran has not asserted that his sarcoidosis was present since service.  Therefore, a continuity of symptoms has not been shown

Next, service connection may also be established if the medical evidence of record indicates a relationship between the Veteran's disorders and his active duty service.  Specifically, he was afforded VA examinations in March 2024.  After a full examination of the Veteran and review of the medical records, the examiner opined that the Veteran's sarcoidosis and bradycardia were less likely than not related to service.  In providing this opinion, the examiner reasoned that the Veteran was treated for acute conditions in service without evidence of continuous symptoms during or for many years after separation from service.  Thus, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's sarcoidosis and bradycardia were more likely than not related to a post-service event as opposed to active duty.  

The Board affords significant probative weight to the opinion rendered by the March 2024 VA examiner.  The opinion was provided by a qualified medical professional after review of the claims file and application of the facts to current medical knowledge.  Accordingly, a nexus has not been established for either condition.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the statements made by the Veteran regarding a relation between his sarcoidosis, bradycardia, and active service.  However, in this case the Veteran is not competent to testify regarding the etiology of his sarcoidosis and bradycardia.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The diagnosis and evaluation of such disorders requires the expertise of a qualified medical professional.  Therefore, the unsubstantiated statements made by the Veteran are found to lack competency.

In conclusion, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for OSA, sarcoidosis and bradycardia is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
