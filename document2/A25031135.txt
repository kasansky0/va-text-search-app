ORDER

Service connection for asthma is denied.

Service connection for sinusitis is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for acne vulgaris is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The persuasive competent evidence fails to show the Veteran is diagnosed with asthma.

2. The persuasive competent evidence fails to show the Veteran is diagnosed with sinusitis.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for asthma have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for sinusitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2007 to May 2014, and from January 2015 to May 2015.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a July 2023 decision.  In December 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2023 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 decision.

In the March 21, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of acne vulgaris, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service. 38 C.F.R. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Every veteran is presumed to be in sound condition upon entry except as to any injury or disease noted at the time of enlistment.  38 U.S.C. § 1111; Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  In determining whether a specific condition is "noted" on entry, the Board's analysis is limited to whether the condition was recorded in the enlistment examination report.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).  The burden then falls on the Government to rebut the presumption of soundness by clear and unmistakable evidence that the disability was both preexisting and not aggravated by service.  Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096; Bagby, 1 Vet. App. at 227.

1. Service connection for asthma.

2. Service connection for sinusitis.

The Veteran contends that he has asthma and sinusitis due to service, including exposure to burn pits.  See February 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.

The Board finds that service connection for asthma and sinusitis is not warranted.  There is no indication of asthma or sinusitis close in proximity to, or during, the pendency of the claim.  See McClain, 21 Vet. App. at 321; Romanowsky, 26 Vet. App. at 289.  While the Veteran believes he suffers from asthma and sinusitis, there is no objective clinical evidence of record confirming asthma or sinusitis diagnoses during the review period.  In so finding, the Board acknowledges that the current disability requirement may be satisfied by showing that the Veteran has symptoms causing functional impairment. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

In June 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his claimed asthma.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's claim for asthma; however, the examiner affirmatively endorsed that the Veteran has not been diagnosed with asthma.  Furthermore, the examiner noted that pulmonary function testing had been performed and that there was "no objective medical record evidence regarding a diagnosis of a respiratory condition."

Additionally, in June 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his claimed sinusitis.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's claim for sinusitis; however, the examiner affirmatively endorsed that the Veteran has not been diagnosed with asthma.  Furthermore, the examiner noted that the Veteran's was diagnosed with allergic rhinitis and stated that "there is no documentary, historical, or clinical evidence of a primary chronic sinusitis condition for this veteran."

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328 (1997).  In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim.  While the Board recognizes the Veteran's general contentions that he has asthma and sinusitis, the record does not show, nor does the Veteran contend, that he has specialized education, training, or experience that would qualify him to diagnose such disabilities.  

The Board has considered Saunders, in which the Federal Circuit held that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a function impairment of earning capacity." Id. at 1367-69.  In this case, the Veteran has not described functional impairment of earning capacity associated with this claimed disability and the competent evidence, to include the June 2023 examination reports, fails to show such impairment.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claims.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for asthma and sinusitis is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for acne vulgaris.

The Veteran contends that he has acne vulgaris due to service.  See February 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that "[he] suffer[s] with constant outbreaks on [his] face due to shaving and exposure to dust and debris. [He] feel[s] extremely self-conscious when [he] [has] an episode."  See id.

The Veteran has a current disability of acne.  See June 2023 VA examination report.  Accordingly, the key inquiry is whether the current condition is related to the Veteran's service.

The Board finds remand is required to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the July 2023 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  The AOJ obtained the June 2023 medical opinion prior to the July 2023 rating decision on appeal; however, the opinion is not adequate for the reasons noted below.

In June 2023, VA obtained a medical opinion for the Veteran's claimed acne vulgaris.  The examiner provided a negative nexus opinion, and as rationale stated the Veteran's acne vulgaris "clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service, was not aggravated beyond its natural progression by an in-service event, injury or illness."  The examiner noted the Veteran's enlistment examination of past acne with use of Minocin, use of Cleocin and Adapalene gel during service, along with the Veteran's May 2014 separation examination noting no skin lesions.  The Board notes the Veteran has two active-duty periods: first (January 2007 to May 2014), second (January 2015 to May 2015).  However, the opinion is inadequate because the examiner's opinion does not account for the Veteran's second active-duty period.

Thus, given that the June 2003 nexus opinion failed to provide adequate rationale, the Board finds remand is necessary to address these deficiencies.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (indicating that if VA provides an examination, that examination must be adequate).  The AOJ's reliance on this opinion constitutes a duty to assist error that must be remedied on remand.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum medical opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of his claimed acne vulgaris.  The clinician must address the following questions:

(a) Did the acne vulgaris clearly and unmistakably (undebatable) preexist the Veteran's second active-duty period (January 3, 2015 - May 21, 2015)?

(b) If the clinician finds the Veteran's acne vulgaris did clearly and unmistakably preexist service, was it clearly and unmistakably not aggravated by the Veteran's second active-duty period (January 3, 2015 - May 21, 2015)?

(c) If the clinician finds that the Veteran's acne vulgaris either did not clearly and unmistakably preexist service or was not clearly and unmistakably not aggravated by service, the examiner must opine whether it is at least as likely as not directly related to service.

The examiner is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions reached. In providing the requested opinions, consider the Veteran's description of his in-service symptoms as well as his post-service symptoms. If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that the Veteran's reported symptoms in service and thereafter represented the onset of his current disability, this should be noted. Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about his symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?

The examiner is reminded that the term "as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility," but rather that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher. Note that the lack of documented treatment in service, or a long period after, while probative, cannot serve as the sole basis for a negative finding. The Veteran's lay contentions must be considered and weighed in making the determination.
