ORDER

Entitlement to reimbursement for supplies under Chapter 31 for vocational rehabilitation that are listed in the October 24, 2019, reimbursement request, that have not previously been reimbursed, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. While participating in rehabilitation services, the Veteran purchased $2,286.97 of supplies related to the pursuit of his Master of Public Administration program during the 2020 academic year and listed in an October 24, 2019, reimbursement request with receipts; pre-authorization from VA was not procured for these supply expenses prior to purchase.

2. The Veteran was not provided clear and consistent guidance by his VA case managers regarding VA procedures with regard to the approval and procurement of supplies during the time period in which the expenses included on the October 24, 2019, reimbursement request were incurred.

3. The evidence supporting and against a finding that the supply costs contained in the October 24, 2019, reimbursement request were necessary to complete the Veteran's rehabilitation services is at least equal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to reimbursement for supply expenses under Chapter 31 for vocational rehabilitation that are listed in the October 24, 2019, request for reimbursement, less any expenses that have already been reimbursed, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3104 5.107; 38 C.F.R. § 21.212.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The administrative decision on appeal was issued in December 2019 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the April 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. On January 4, 2024, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2019 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran, or representative, within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

Entitlement to reimbursement for supplies under Chapter 31 for vocational rehabilitation 

The Veteran requests reimbursement for supplies under Chapter 31 for vocational rehabilitation; the reimbursement request on appeal was submitted on December October 24, 2019, for expenses incurred in the 2020 academic year.

The Veteran contends that his previous laptop used while receiving Chapter 31 educational assistance was not repairable and a new laptop, with specific software capabilities, had to be purchased. In his October 24, 2019, Request for and Receipt of Supplies (VA Form 28-1905m), the Veteran listed an Apple Macbook Pro, valued at $2,099.00, an Apple compatible laptop mouse, valued at $79.99, and an Apple compatible portable hard drive, valued at $106.99. The Veteran provided receipts for these items, and additionally provided the receipt for his computer repair, valued at $30, along with a recommendation from First Resource Computer that recommended the purchase of an Apple MacBook Pro for the Veteran's coursework. The Veteran also provided a receipt for Applecare+ for the Macbook Pro purchase, valued at $303.20. The total amount of reimbursement requested was $2,620.17.

Although the Veteran did not obtain pre-approval for the purchases, in the December 2019 decision on appeal, the Veteran Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) found that the Veteran's request for supplies, equipment, and/or incidental goods and services was approved. However, the VRC only approved a reimbursement of $1,500. Therefore, the Veteran is seeking the remaining requested reimbursement, in the amount of $1,120.17.

The purpose of VA vocational rehabilitation services is to enable veterans with compensable service-connected disabilities to achieve independence in daily living and, to the maximum extent feasible, become employable and obtain and maintain suitable employment. 38 U.S.C. § 3100; 38 C.F.R. § 21.70. The estimate of program costs for rehabilitation services during a calendar year or lesser period shall be based upon services necessary to carry out the Veteran's rehabilitation plan during that period and shall be developed by the VBA case manager. § 21.430(b). If additional approval is required, the VBA case manager shall secure such additional approval prior to authorization of services. Id. 

Supplies are furnished to a veteran to enable him or her to pursue rehabilitation and achieve the goals of his or her vocational rehabilitation program. 38 U.S.C. § 3104 (a); 38 C.F.R. 21.210. Such supplies may include books, tools, and other supplies and equipment which VA determines are necessary for the veteran's rehabilitation program. 38 C.F.R. § 21.210(b). Supplies needed for special projects and theses may not exceed the amount generally needed by similarly circumstanced nonveterans in meeting course or thesis requirements. § 20.210(e).

A veteran will be furnished supplies that are necessary for a program of rehabilitation services. § 21.212. For example, a veteran training in a school will be furnished the supplies needed to pursue the school course. Id. Subject to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.210 through 21.222, VA will authorize only those supplies that are required: (1) to be used by similarly circumstanced non-disabled persons in the same training or employment situation; (2) to mitigate or compensate for the effects of the veteran's disability while he or she is being evaluated, trained or assisted in gaining employment; or (3) to allow the veteran to function more independently and thereby lessen his or her dependence on others for assistance. Id. Supplies should generally be authorized after the date of enrollment in training or beginning date of other rehabilitation services unless there are compelling reasons to authorize them earlier. Id. 

The case manager is responsible for the authorization of supplies, subject to requirements for prior approval contained in § 21.258 of the regulations and other instructions governing payment of program charges. § 21.212(f). To the extent practicable, VA will make arrangements for the school or other facility furnishing training, rehabilitation assistance, or employment under Chapter 31 to provide supplies; when supplies are not furnished directly by the facility VA will issue authorized supplies directly to the Veteran. § 21.218. Supplies are to be furnished under the most careful of checks by the case manager as to what is needed by the Veteran to pursue his or her program; determination of the supplies needed to enable the Veteran to successfully pursue his or her rehabilitation program are made under the provisions of §§ 2.210 through 21.222. § 21.224. Additionally, § 21.220(b), which pertains to the replacement of supplies indicates that VA will not generally reimburse a Veteran who personally buys supplies.

A Veteran requesting or being provided services under Chapter 31 must, among other things, seek assistance of VA staff as necessary to resolve problems which affect attainment of the goals of the rehabilitation plan and conform to the procedures established by VA governing pursuit of a rehabilitation plan to include securing supplies. § 21.362(c). Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E) case management staff are responsible for monitoring the Veteran's conduct and cooperation and providing assistance that may be authorized under Chapter 31. § 21.362(d). When the case manager determines that the veteran's conduct or cooperation are not in conformity with the provisions of § 21.362(c), the case manager will discuss the situation with the Veteran and arrange for services, particularly counseling services which may assist in resolving the problems which led to the veteran's unsatisfactory conduct or cooperation.

As stated above, the Veteran submitted a reimbursement request for a total of $2,620.17 on October 24, 2019, for supply requests stemming from a new laptop purchase necessary for his course curriculum. The Veteran submitted receipts for the claimed expenses. In response, the VRC granted the Veteran's reimbursement request, but limited the amount to $1,500. In the December 2019 decision on appeal, the VRC stated that the Veteran "could be reimbursed up to $1500 for a laptop purchase." However, although the VRC cites 38 C.F.R. § 21.256, 21.210, and 21.212, these regulations do not impose a monetary limit on the amount of reimbursement available for laptops under Chapter 31. Furthermore, 38 C.F.R. § 21.210 states that the term 'supplies' includes supplies and equipment which VA determines are necessary for the Veteran's program. Therefore, the Board has the authority to determine what supplies are necessary for the Veteran's rehabilitation program. Furthermore, 38 C.F.R. § 21.212(d) authorizes VA to find that a supply is necessary for a Veteran to successfully pursue his or her program.

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that due to: (1) the lack of clear written communication between the Veteran and his case manager regarding the parameters of supply reimbursement requests to include any justification for monetary limitations; and, (2) appropriate supporting justification for these incurred supply expenses being provided by the Veteran, the evidence in support of and against a finding that these expenses are necessary to complete the Veteran's rehabilitation services is at least equal.
