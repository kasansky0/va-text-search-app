ORDER

The appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (previously diagnosed as other specified trauma and stressor related disorder, and adjustment like disorder) is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder, acquired, and adjustment like disorder, with a notice dated April 29. 2021.

2. On May 13, 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), seeking Board review of the April 2021 rating decision denying service connection.

3. While the appeal arising from the May 2021 NOD was pending before the Board, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, on October 25, 2022.

4. The AOJ issued a rating decision, with notice issuing November 29, 2022, denying entitlement to service connection for PTSD, based on the October 2022 supplemental claim.

5. On December 13, 2022, the Veteran filed a NOD, from which the instant appeal arises, challenging the November 2022 rating decision.

6. The instant appeal arose from the October 2022 supplemental claim challenging the April 2021 rating decision and is thus a duplicate of the separate May 2021 appeal of that decision.

7. In April 2025, the Board issued a decision in the May 2021 appeal of the April 2021 rating decision and remanded the matter for further development.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of this redundant appeal of entitlement to service connection for PTSD are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7104(a), 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.202. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1969 to May 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2022 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

Appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for PTSD

For the reasons set forth below, the instant appeal, arising from the Veteran's December 2022 NOD challenging a November 2022 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for PTSD, is a redundant appeal subject to dismissal. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7104(a), 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.202.

A rating decision is subject to one review on appeal by the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a). As a general matter, for that one review on appeal, a claimant may elect one of three review options within one year of the date the AOJ issues a decision, as follows: (i) Higher-Level Review by the AOJ; (ii) Supplemental Claim; or (iii) appeal to the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1). If a request for review under one of these three lanes is pending final adjudication, the claimant may not file a request for review under a different lane without first withdrawing the pending review request. 38 U.S.C. § 5104(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.205.

Prior to the November 2022 rating decision, the AOJ previously denied, with a notice dated April 29. 2021, an October 2020 supplemental claim seeking entitlement to service connection for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder, acquired, and adjustment like disorder. The Veteran filed a NOD to appeal that rating decision on May 13, 2021. While that appeal of the April 2021 rating decision remained pending before the Board, the Veteran filed another supplemental claim application on October 25, 2022. On November 29, 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision denying the October 2022 supplemental claim seeking entitlement to service connection for PTSD. The Veteran then filed the NOD underlying the instant appeal on December 13, 2022, seeking to challenge the November 2022 rating decision of the AOJ on the PTSD claim. December 2022 NOD.

The Veteran did not withdraw the Board appeal in Docket Number 210513-158954 as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD and the appeal remained pending when the Veteran filed his October 2022 supplemental claim. Therefore, the October 2022 supplemental claim was a prohibited concurrent election for the Veteran's appeal of the April 2021 rating decision. 38 U.S.C. § 5104(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). As a result of the prohibited concurrent election, this appeal is redundant to the appeal in Docket Number 210513-158954 and must be dismissed as violating the "one review on appeal" statutory principle. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a). 

This dismissal is not prejudicial to the Veteran because the Board addressed the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD in an April 2025 decision in the Veteran's one appeal of right under § 7104 and remanded the matter for further development.
