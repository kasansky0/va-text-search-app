ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a migraine headache disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

When all doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor, the migraine headache disability is due to the Veteran's service-connected unspecified depressive disorder. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

When all doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for a migraine headache disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1984 to March 1988.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 supplemental claim rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denying entitlement to service connection for a migraine headache disability. See Rating Decision - Narrative, dated September 11, 2023. Therefore, the AMA applies. See Pub. L. No. 115-55, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). On August 26, 2023, the Veteran timely filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), and selected the Direct Review Docket.

Under the AMA, the evidentiary record the Board may consider depends on the evidence considered by AOJ in the decision on appeal and the Veteran's docket selection on the NOD. The present appeal stems from disagreement with the September 11, 2023, rating decision which considered the evidence of record at the time. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 3.2601. As indicated above, the Veteran selected the Direct Review Docket when submitting the NOD. The Board may therefore only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 11, 2023, rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a). If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the September 11, 2023, rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider in association with the claim, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision, including the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to Service Connection for a Migraine Headache Disability

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for a migraine headache disability that he contends is caused by his active-duty service or his service-connected unspecified depressive disorder. See NOD, received August 26, 2023

Generally, establishing service connection requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

VA treats migraine headaches as a "chronic disease" for purposes of 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); accordingly, the presumptive service connection provisions under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) for service connection based on "chronic" symptoms in service and "continuous" symptoms since service are applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 1101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may also be granted for a disability that is the result of a service-connected disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). When service connection is thus established for a secondary condition, the secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Harder v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 183, 187 (1993). The controlling regulation has been interpreted to permit a grant of service connection not only for disability caused by a service-connected disability, but for the degree of disability resulting from aggravation of a non-service-connected disability by a service-connected disability. See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

In deciding an appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material favorable to the claimant. Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990). If the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, the Veteran prevails; but, if the weight of the evidence is against a claim, the Veteran must fail, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Here, the AOJ made the following favorable determinations as part of the September 2023 rating decision: (1) the Veteran has a diagnosis of a migraine headache disability, (2) the Veteran is service connected for unspecified depressive disorder. See Rating Decision - Narrative, dated September 11, 2023. The Board is bound by these findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). In that same decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's migraine headache disability because "[t]he VA medical opinion found no link between [the] diagnosed medical condition and the service-connected unspecified depressive disorder." See Rating Decision - Narrative, dated September 11, 2023. The Board notes that two examinations are listed under the 'Evidence' heading in the September 2023 rating decision-the first, a VA medical examination conducted April 4, 2023, and the second, from private provider D.L., MPH, MS, APRN, CPH, OHC, conducted July 20, 2023. Id.

During the VA examination, the examiner opined that the Veteran's diagnosed migraine headache disability was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected unspecified depressive disorder. See C&P Exam, received April 11, 2023. The examiner indicated that the migraine headache disability and the unspecified depressive disorder were "not medically related" and instead are "separate entit[ies] entirely." Id. The examiner found no medical literature to support the Veteran's claim and therefore determined that no nexus was established. Id. 

Conversely, the medical opinion submitted from private provider D.L., determined that the Veteran's migraine headache disability was at least as likely as not related to or aggravated by his service-connected unspecified depressive disorder. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility, received July 27, 2023. D.L. pointed to articles in medical journals revealing increased cortisol concentrations in patients with chronic migraines. Id. at 3. They explained that because cortisol is released from the hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal system in response to stress, these increased concentrations could suggest that when a person with psychiatric symptomology, like the Veteran, experiences stressors, the body may release cortisol (and adrenaline) that will manifest into migraine headaches. Id. at 6. 

After carefully reviewing the evidence, the Board finds each examiner is a medically trained professional who is both competent and credible to provide the requested opinions. See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Although neither of the opinions was perfectly rationalized, each maintains a degree of probative value. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). The Board is therefore left with one decision opposed to a nexus for the Veteran's migraine headache disability, and one otherwise in favor. The Board will therefore resolve reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and find that the evidence is in approximate balance. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Based on the foregoing, the Board determines that entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's migraine headache disability is warranted secondary to a service-connected disability. To that extent, the appeal is granted.
