REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable rating for left knee laceration is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1000 to September 2003.

On appeal is a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that granted service connection for a left knee laceration and assigned a non-compensable (0%) disability rating effective September 25, 2023.

In April 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to a compensable rating for left knee laceration, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The matter is now before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) for further adjudication.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for left knee laceration is remanded.

The Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error was made in that the Veteran should have been afforded an adequate VA examination. 

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for his newly service-connected left knee laceration.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2024. However, the Board finds this examination was not adequate for VA rating purposes. The examiner noted in the medical history section of her written report that the Veteran sustained a laceration to his medial left lower leg during PT on 4/22/2000; that sutures were required; that he now has 1 scar; and, that the scar is painful at rest, as well as with contact with clothing or if hit on a surface or object. However, in another section of the same written report, the examiner indicated the Veteran did not have a "painful" scar. The Board finds that whether or not the Veteran has a "painful" scar is particularly relevant under the rating criteria governing scars. Under Diagnostic Code 7804, a painful scar warrants at least a 10 percent rating. 

As such, because the February 2024 VA examination is internally inconsistent about whether the Veteran has a painful left knee laceration/scar, it is inadequate for VA rating purposes. When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's claim file contains a January 2025 VA examination, but this examination report could not be considered. As noted in the introduction above, any evidence submitted after the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

On remand, a new VA examination must be obtained.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the current severity of his service-connected left knee laceration. 

The entire claims file, including this remand, must be made available to the examiner.
