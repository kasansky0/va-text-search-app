REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from December 2003 to February 2005 and from March 2006 to September 2014. He is barred from receiving disability benefits resulting from his service on and after March 16, 2009. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on an appeal of a rating decision issued in July 2022 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. In the July 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome.

2. Entitlement to service connection for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome.

The Veteran contends entitlement to service connection for left and right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome. 

As favorably found by the AOJ, the Veteran has a current bilateral knee patellofemoral pain syndrome as diagnosed by a September 2015 VA examiner. 

As an initial matter, the Board is cognizant that the AOJ previously considered the Veteran to have a left knee disability that pre-existed service during a prior adjudication of the claim. The Board disagrees. Every Veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service. 38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b). 

Therefore, where there is evidence showing that a disorder manifested or was incurred in service, and this disorder is not noted on the Veteran's entrance examination report, this presumption of soundness operates to shield the Veteran from any finding that the unnoted disease or injury preexisted service. Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48 (2012); Bagby v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 225, 227 (1991); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b). Such presumption is only rebutted where the evidence clearly and unmistakably shows that the Veteran's disability (1) existed before acceptance and enrollment into service and (2) was not aggravated by service. Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Bagby, 1 Vet. App. at 227; VAOPGCPREC 3-2003 (July 16, 2003). 

Here, the Veteran reported a history of a left femur fracture when he was 13 at entrance. However, the entrance examination notes his lower extremities were normal and no defects or diagnoses were noted. Therefore, the Board finds the presumption of soundness applies, and there is no evidence of record showing a left knee disability clearly and unmistakably existed before acceptance and enrollment into service to rebut this presumption. Consequently, the Board finds the July 2016 VA medical opinion regarding aggravation of a preexisting left knee disability to be inadequate. The opinion is not relevant, but it also relies on an inaccurate factual premise and fails to address 2005 service treatment records further discussed below. 

The Veteran submitted a medical opinion from a non-VA physician dated March 2022. The physician opined the Veteran's bilateral knee pain and patellofemoral syndrome is caused by or a result of high milage running, citing to a May 2013 service treatment record noting a history of knee pain with insidious onset over three years duration as a result of high mileage running. Service treatment records from December 2009 do show a complaint of knee pain since early December 2009 while running that did not start in or was aggravated by OIF/OEF (Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom). 

The Veteran's service treatment records show medical treatment for bilateral knee problems during the period of service from which the Veteran's is barred from receiving disability benefits. A February 2009 service treatment record is silent for any knee problems. In March 2007 the Veteran denied experiencing a decline in the way he walked, balanced, or moved or decreased strength, range of motion, or endurance that limited daily activities in his knees and denied experiencing any pain generally. In January 2005 the Veteran reported that he experienced knee pain that he did not seek medical care for during active duty but also denied any having swollen, stiff, or painful joints. 

The Board finds the March 2022 non-VA physician's medical opinion to be inadequate as to whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's service before March 16, 2009, and the Veteran's left or right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome. The rationale provided by the physician focuses solely on evidence after March 16, 2009, a period of service for which disability benefits are not available. 

The record reflects the AOJ attempted to obtain VA medical opinions regarding direct service connection for the Veteran's bilateral knee disabilities, but ultimately it did not obtain them. Failure to do so under the circumstances, regardless of whether the Veteran did or did not attend an April 2022 VA examination for such disabilities, is a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand is warranted to correct it. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

Further, the Veteran submitted additional lay statements regarding the onset of his knee pain during his service before March 16, 2009, at an informal conference in June 2022. Despite receipt of this favorable evidence at the informal conference, the record reflects the AOJ did not find a duty to assist error in its May 2022 adjudication which would have allowed for consideration of this new, favorable evidence, and for the AOJ to obtain a medical opinion considering it. The Board finds the AOJ's July 2022 decision finding there was no duty to assist error in its May 2022 adjudication of the claims fails to satisfy regulatory and statutory duties regarding higher-level reviews under these circumstances. Remand is warranted to correct this failure to satisfy a regulatory and statutory duty. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

3. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran contends entitlement to service connection for tinnitus. 

As favorably found by the AOJ the Veteran has a current tinnitus disability as confirmed by a December 2021 VA examiner. The VA examiner noted an onset date of 2013 with circumstances that the tinnitus onset during the Veteran's combat deployment in Afghanistan, which was after March 16, 2009. The VA examiner provided a positive nexus opinion relying on the onset of the Veteran's tinnitus being in 2013. Consequently, the December 2021 VA medical opinion is not relevant and inadequate as to whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and his service before March 16, 2009, for which benefits are available. 

At the June 2022 informal conference, the Veteran stated that he was unsure how the December 2021 VA examiner determined that tinnitus onset in 2013, because he contends it onset before March 16, 2009. Despite receipt of this favorable evidence at the informal conference, the record reflects the AOJ did not find a duty to assist error in its May 2022 adjudication which would have allowed for consideration of this new, favorable evidence, and for the AOJ to obtain a medical opinion considering it. The Board finds the AOJ's July 2022 decision finding there was no duty to assist error in its May 2022 adjudication of the claim fails to satisfy regulatory and statutory duties regarding higher-level reviews under these circumstances. Remand is warranted to correct this failure to satisfy a regulatory and statutory duty. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

4. Entitlement to service connection for anemia.

The Veteran contends entitlement to service connection for anemia as diagnosed during service based on laboratory records. 

The record reflects the Veteran has a current anemia disability, as confirmed by VA medical records showing a diagnosis of and treatment for anemia approximate to the date of the claim. Service treatment records are silent for any diagnosis for or medical treatment of anemia or any laboratory findings prior to March 16, 2009, to show the Veteran experienced anemia during the eligible period of service. In November 2010 the Veteran denied having a chronic health problem like anemia or other blood disorder. The record reflects VA has not obtained an examination or a medical opinion in relation to this claim. 

The record reflects the Veteran served in Kuwait from March 2004 to January 2005 and toxic exposure and participation in toxic exposure risk activity is presumed from this deployment during a period of eligible service. On August 10, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act). 38 U.S.C. § 1168 requires a medical nexus opinion and examination be obtained when there is evidence of a current disability and participation in a toxic exposure risk activity, but insufficient evidence to establish service connection. 

Here, there is evidence of a current disability and participation in a toxic exposure risk activity, but insufficient evidence to establish service connection. The exceptions to this statutory and regulatory requirement to provide the Veteran an examination and obtain a medical opinion do not apply in this case. Consequently, remand is warranted to satisfy this regulatory and statutory duty. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Forward the record, to include a copy of this Remand, to an appropriate medical professional for an opinion as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's left and right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome and tinnitus. Following a review of the relevant record, the medical professional is asked to address the following:

(a.) Is it as approximately likely as not that the Veteran's left or right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome onset during or is otherwise related to his service before March 16, 2009? 

(b.) Is it as approximately likely as not that the Veteran's tinnitus onset during or is otherwise related to his service before March 16, 2009?

The medical professional should address the Veteran's lay statements made at the June 2022 informal conference and the January 2005 service treatment records further discussed above. 

2. Afford the Veteran an appropriate examination to determine the nature and etiology of his anemia. The record, to include a copy of this Remand, must be made available to the medical professional and all indicated tests and studies should be accomplished. Following a review of the relevant record, and even if an examination is not accomplished, the medical professional is asked to address the following:

Is it as approximately likely as not that the Veteran's anemia is related to his in-service toxic exposure before March 16, 2009? 

		A rationale for any opinion offered should be provided.
