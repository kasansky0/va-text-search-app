3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for urinary frequency and urgency with leaking secondary to colorectal cancer have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps on active duty from October 1965 to August 1966.

The issues come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the June 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be warranted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show: (1) that a current disability exists; and (2) that the current disability was either caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

1. Entitlement to service connection for colorectal cancer

The Veteran contends his diagnosis of colorectal cancer is related to his active-duty service.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that his current disability is related to exposure to contaminated water during his period of service at Camp Lejeune.

The December 2023 rating decision includes the favorable finding that the Veteran was diagnosed with rectal cancer in the Veteran's February 2023 VA examination.

The Veteran's military personnel records establish the Veteran served at Camp Lejeune from December 1965 to April 1966.  The Veteran has well over 30 days (cumulative and consecutive) of service at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  Accordingly, the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(7).

Notably, the Veteran's current colorectal cancer is not a disease associated with exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309.  Accordingly, although the Veteran's period of service indicates exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, the Veteran's colorectal cancer may not be presumed to be service-connected.  Thus, service connection on a presumptive basis is therefore not warranted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Presumptions notwithstanding, the Veteran is not precluded from establishing service connection for his colorectal cancer with proof of direct causation.  See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1041-42 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

The Veteran's service treatment records are absent of any treatment, complaints, or symptoms associated with the Veteran's colorectal condition.  Additionally, the Veteran's July 1966 separation physical examination provided no abnormal findings regarding the Veteran's anus and rectum.

In February 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination addressing the Veteran's claimed condition.  The VA examiner provided a diagnosis of rectal cancer and chemotherapy induced neuropathy.  The examiner reported the Veteran's condition as active after completing chemotherapy and radiation treatment in 2019.

In April 2023, the RO provided the Veteran a VA rectal conditions examination.  The VA examiner provided the diagnosis of diarrhea or constipation without warning.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's history of colorectal cancer and treatment involving radiation and chemotherapy.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran also had lower extremity neuropathy and pain in his legs.

The record contains the private medical opinion completed in November 2024.  Following a review of the Veteran's medical history and medical literature, the private examiner provided the medical opinion that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's colorectal cancer is due to his exposure to contaminated water during his active-duty service at Camp Lejeune.  The private examiner identified the harmful chemicals found in Camp Lejeune's water supply, and cited medical and scientific literature that found these chemicals to be carcinogenic in humans by all routes of exposure.  The private examiner noted established medical studies that showed Camp Lejeune contaminated drinking water caused elevated risks for cancers, including cancers of the rectum.  Further, the private examiner considered the Veteran's other risk factors and concluded that the Veteran's colorectal cancer was at least as likely as not caused by exposure to contaminated water during his service at Camp Lejeune.

Following a review of the record, the Board finds the evidence of record shows direct causation between the Veteran's colorectal cancer and residual conditions and his active service and in-service exposure to chemicals in the water supply of Camp Lejeune.  The Board finds the November 2024 private examination and medical opinion to be of significant probative value in determining that the Veteran's colorectal cancer was at least as likely as not caused by exposure to contaminated water during his service at Camp Lejeune.  The Board notes that the probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient's medical history, their knowledge, and skill in analyzing the data, and their medical conclusion.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444 (2000).  Whether a medical professional provides a basis for his or her medical opinion goes to the weight or credibility of the evidence in the adjudication of the merits.  See Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998).

Here, the reviewing physician's opinion was based on review of the Veteran's lay contentions, his reported medical history, medical literature, and review of the medical evidence of record.  Further, complete, and thorough rationales were given for the opinion provided and they are consistent with the medical evidence of record.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295, 299-304 (2008); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) (noting in weighing credibility, VA may consider inconsistent statements and consistency with other evidence of record).

Additionally, while the Board notes the July 2023 addendum VA medical opinion provided negative evidence regarding the causal relationship between the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, the Board finds, given the Veteran's credible lay statements and the November 2024 private medical opinion, the evidence of record is at least in approximate balance on this matter.  The Board must consider all the evidence of record and make appropriate competence, credibility, and weight determinations.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 367-68 (2005).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, by law, the Board must resolve all reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1154(a); 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

Thus, in the present case, the benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, and entitlement to service connection for colorectal cancer is granted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303, see Lynch, supra.

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy secondary to colorectal cancer

3. Entitlement to service connection for urinary frequency and urgency with leaking secondary to colorectal cancer

The Veteran contends that he suffers from peripheral neuropathy and urinary frequency and urgency with leaking secondary to colorectal cancer.

The December 2023 rating decision includes the favorable findings that the Veteran was diagnosed with rectal cancer and urinary frequency and urgency with leaking during the Veteran's February 2023 VA examination.  Further, the AOJ made the favorable finding that "the February 202[3] VA examiner" linked the Veteran's neuropathy of the lower extremities and urinary frequency and urgency with leaking to the Veteran's treatment of the rectal cancer.

Additionally, the November 2024 private medical opinion determined that the Veteran's colorectal cancer and chemoradiation treatment have caused numerous residuals, to include urinary incontinence and bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy since November 2022.

The Board is bound by the December 2023 favorable findings made by VA, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Here, the Board finds the evidence of record shows the Veteran's urinary incontinence and bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy are secondary to the Veteran's colorectal cancer and chemoradiation treatment.

Thus, the evidence of record demonstrates the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy and urinary incontinence, frequency and urgency were caused or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected rectal cancer.  See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (establishing "but-for" causation standard broader than proximate cause which is not limited to a single cause and effect, but rather contemplates multi-causal links including medication and treatment).  Therefore, following the Board's grant of service connection for the Veteran's colorectal cancer, the criteria for service connection for bilateral peripheral neuropathy and urinary frequency and urgency with leakage secondary to the Veteran's cancer and treatment, have been met.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.
