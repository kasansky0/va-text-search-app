ORDER

The January 18, 2024, Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) remand of the issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (IU) prior to December 10, 2013, is vacated.

The issue of entitlement to an initial rating of 30 percent, but not higher, for ischemic heart disease (IHD) prior to December 10, 2013, is dismissed.

The issue of entitlement to IU prior to December 10, 2013, is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On January 18, 2024, the Board issued an AMA decision granting an initial rating of 30 percent, but not higher, for IHD prior to December 10, 2013; granting a 100 percent rating for IHD from December 10, 2013, to January 6, 2015; granting a 100 percent rating for IHD from May 1, 2015, to September 16, 2019; and remanding the issue of entitlement to IU prior to December 10, 2013. Following an appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) appealing the grant of 30 percent for IHD prior to December 10, 2013, the parties entered into a joint motion for partial remand (JMPR) agreeing that the 30 percent grant for IHD prior to December 10, 2013, should be vacated, and CAVC issued an order granting the JMPR.

2. The Veteran's December 2019 appeal was docketed on the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system when there was already an active docket under the Legacy system regarding the issues on appeal, and the Board sent the Veteran apparently conflicting letters regarding the system under which the appeal was docketed.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for vacatur of the January 18, 2024, Board Remand have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.904.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to an initial rating of 30 percent, but not higher, for IHD prior to December 10, 2013, have been met, so that this issue may be addressed under the Legacy system. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2(c), 20.202.

3. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to IU prior to December 10, 2013, have been met, so that this issue may be addressed under the Legacy system. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2(c), 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1966 to November 1968.

The case is before the Board on a JMPR from CAVC.

In response to an April 2028 Board remand, a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) was issued by the Regional Office (RO) in October 2019. In December 2019, the Board received a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) from the Veteran, requesting Board review of the October 2019 SSOC. The NOD selected the hearing docket, but did not check the box indicating that the Veteran wished to opt in to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) any issues currently under the Legacy system. 

Letters were sent from the Board to the Veteran, some of which indicated that his NOD was docketed in the Legacy system, while others indicated that it was docketed under the AMA system. 

On January 18, 2024, the Board issued an AMA decision granting an initial rating of 30 percent, but not higher, for IHD prior to December 10, 2013; granting a 100 percent rating for IHD from December 10, 2013, to January 6, 2015; granting a 100 percent rating for IHD from May 1, 2015, to September 16, 2019; and remanding the issue of entitlement to IU prior to December 10, 2013. 

Following an appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) appealing the grant of 30 percent for IHD prior to December 10, 2013, the parties entered into a joint motion for partial remand (JMPR) agreeing that the 30 percent grant for IHD prior to December 10, 2013, should be vacated, and that the Board should review whether the appeal should have been decided under the Legacy or AMA system. CAVC issued an order granting the JMPR, and the case was returned to the Board. 

1. The January 8, 2024 Board remand of the issue of entitlement to IU prior to December 10, 2013, is vacated.

The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may vacate an appellate decision at any time upon request of the appellant or his or her representative, or on the Board's own motion, when an appellant has been denied due process of law or when benefits were allowed based on false or fraudulent evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.904.

The Veteran argues that his appeal should have remained in the Legacy system because he did not check the "opt-in" box on his December 2019 VA Form 10182. The AMA came into effect on February 19, 2019. Where a VA Form 10182 is submitted to the Board within 60 days following an SSOC issued on or after February 19, 2019, it constitutes a valid AMA opt-in provided that it indicates the issue(s) and rating decision(s) that the appellant seeks to appeal, and which AMA review lane is requested-there is no requirement that the appellant check the "opt-in" box in order for the 10182 to constitute a valid AMA opt-in. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). The Veteran's December 2019 10182 therefore was legally sufficient to constitute an AMA opt-in of the issues appealed.

However, by mistakenly docketing the appeal under the AMA system in addition to the Legacy docket that was already currently active for the same issues, and sending conflicting information to the Veteran regarding whether his appeal was docketed under the Legacy or AMA system, the Board needlessly caused or increased confusion regarding which system the appeal would be decided under. 

Because of VA's role in causing confusion regarding the docketing of the appeal, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the appealed issues should have remained in the Legacy system, and the Veteran's request to have the remaining issues on appeal decided under the Legacy system is granted.

Because the Veteran's request to have the appealed issues addressed under the Legacy system is being granted, the Board vacates the January 18, 2024, Board remand of the issue of entitlement to IU prior to December 10, 2013. The orders awarding a 100 percent rating for IHD from December 10, 2013, to January 6, 2015, and a 100 percent rating for IHD from May 1, 2015, to September 16, 2019, are grants that will not be disturbed, and will remain in effect.

2. The issue of entitlement to an initial rating of 30 percent, but not higher, for IHD prior to December 10, 2013, is dismissed

The issue of entitlement to an increased initial rating for IHD prior to December 10, 2013, having been remanded for reconsideration by the Board, is dismissed so that it may be addressed under the separate appeal already docketed under the Legacy system.

3. The issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability prior to December 10, 2013, is dismissed

Having vacated the January 2024 remand of the issue of entitlement to IU prior to December 10, 2013, the Board also dismisses this issue so that it may be addressed under the separate appeal already docketed under the Legacy system.
