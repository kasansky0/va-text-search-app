REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1973 to November 1975. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on March 15, 2024.  

The Veteran elected the direct review docket.  Because the Veteran elected the direct review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801

Entitlement to individual unemployability is remanded.

For the period on appeal, service connection had been established for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rated 50 percent disabling and non-erosive gastritis rated 10 percent disabling with a total disability rating of 60 percent. 

The Veteran contends that TDIU is warranted due to PTSD symptoms. 

At a January 2023 VA examination, the Veteran was found to have occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care, and conversation. 

In October 2022, the Veteran underwent a vocational assessment by a certified rehabilitation counselor.  That assessment indicated that the Veteran is unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment due to his PTSD. 

On a June 2022, VA Form 21-8940: Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, the Veteran reported being unable to secure or follow any substantially gainful employment due to service-connected disabilities. 

For consideration for TDIU pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a), the Veteran must meet a minimum percentage combined service-connected rating.  If the Veteran has one service-connected disability, it must be rated 60 percent or more.  If the Veteran has two or more service-connected disabilities, at least one disability must be rated 40 percent or more and the combined rating of all the service-connected disabilities must be 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

The Veteran does not meet the percentage criteria for consideration of the assignment of TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).  However, if there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a veteran is unemployable because of service-connected disabilities, the case should be referred to the Director of the compensation service for extraschedular consideration.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (b); Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019).  The standard for referral is lower than the standard for granting or denying TDIU.  Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1 (2021).  Here, the Veteran reports being unable to work due to a service-connected disability, had not worked for several years prior to the period in question, and significant impairment was found on examination.  The Board finds that remand is necessary for referral to the Director of the compensation service for consideration of extraschedular TDIU.

Moreover, there is perhaps some overlap between this claim and his currently pending appeal for entitlement to an increased rating of his service-connected PTSD, as that decision may impact this instant appeal and whether the schedular rating for TDIU is met. As such, this matter is at least in part inextricably intertwined with the pending appeal and this matter should be stayed pending such adjudication by the Board.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

(Continued on the next page)

?

1.) Stay the referral to the Director of Compensation and resulting readjudication pending resolution of the Veteran's current appeal before the Board regarding an increased rating of his PTSD.

2.) Thereafter, if and only if deemed necessary, refer the issue of entitlement to TDIU pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (b), to the Director of the Compensation Service for consideration.  Send the Director the entire claims file.  If the Director finds that the Veteran is not entitled to TDIU pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (b), the Director should issue a memorandum explaining the reasons for that decision and a summary of the evidence considered.
