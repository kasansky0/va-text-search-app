ORDER

Entitlement to educational assistance benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Chapter 33 or Post-9/11 GI Bill) education benefits, not to exceed the number of months of unused entitlement under Chapter 30, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's period of service from April 2016 to April 2022 was used to establish eligibility for educational assistance benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 30, known as the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB or Chapter 30) program.

2. The Veteran properly executed an irrevocable election to receive Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance benefits in lieu of receiving such benefits under Chapter 30.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to educational assistance benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Chapter 33 or Post-9/11 GI Bill) education benefits, not to exceed the number of months of unused entitlement under Chapter 30, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3301, 3311, 3322, 3327; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.9505, 21.9520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from April 2016 until his honorable discharge in April 2022.  See April 2022 DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty).

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  See April 2023 Education Decision Letter.

In the May 2023 VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  See May 2023 VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)), Part II.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Education

The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides for VA educational assistance for members of the Armed Forces based on active-duty service after September 10, 2001.

The law provides that individuals entitled to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33 who are also eligible for educational assistance under Chapter 30, among other programs, "may not receive assistance under two or more such programs concurrently but shall elect (in such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe) under which chapter or provisions to receive educational assistance."  38 U.S.C. § 3322(a).  The law also prohibits duplication of eligibility based on a single event or period of service.  38 U.S.C. § 3322(h)(1).  Specifically, the law states that "[a]n individual with qualifying service in the Armed Forces that establishes eligibility on the part of such individual for educational assistance under [chapter 33], chapter 30, or Chapter 32 of this title, and chapter 1606 or 1607 of title 10, shall elect (in such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe) under which authority such service is to be credited."  Id.  This law was due to amendments enacted by Congress, which were made effective August 1, 2011.  See Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-377, § 111, 124 Stat. 4106, 4120-21 (Jan. 4, 2011).

However, the Board notes that there are also provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 3327 that provide that an individual who meets the minimum service requirements for basic eligibility for Chapter 33 educational assistance, and who is eligible for educational assistance under Chapter 30, may receive Chapter 33 educational assistance if he/she makes an irrevocable election to receive benefits under Chapter 33 in lieu of receiving such benefits under Chapter 30.  These provisions further provide that an individual who elects Chapter 33 benefits in lieu of Chapter 30 benefits shall be limited to the number of months of unused entitlement under Chapter 30 as of the date of the election.  38 U.S.C. § 3327(d)(2).

The implementing regulation for 38 U.S.C. § 3327 provides that an individual may make an irrevocable election to receive benefits under Chapter 33 by properly completing a VA Form 22-1990, submitting a transfer-of-entitlement designation under this chapter to the Department of Defense, or submitting a written statement that includes the following: (i) identification information (including name, social security number, and address); (ii) if applicable, an election to receive benefits under Chapter 33 in lieu of benefits under, e.g., the MGIB; (iii) the date the individual wants the election to be effective; and (iv) an acknowledgement that the election is irrevocable (e.g., "I understand that my election is irrevocable and may not be changed.").  38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(c)(2).

1. Entitlement to educational assistance benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Chapter 33 or Post-9/11 GI Bill) education benefits is denied.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to education benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Chapter 33 or Post-9/11 GI Bill).

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that the issue of service after September 10, 2001, is not in dispute.  As noted above, the Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from April 2016 until his honorable discharge in April 2022.  The Board finds that the Veteran meets the basic eligibility requirements for receipt of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits, as set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 3311 and 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(b).

The Board notes that in July 2019, the Veteran established eligibility for education benefits under Chapter 30, while he was still on active duty.  See July 2019 VA Form 22-1990 (Application for VA Education Benefits).

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted an application for education benefits under Chapter 33 in lieu of Chapter 30 benefits, effective April 25, 2023, the date of his application.  See April 2023 VA Form 22-1990 (Application for VA Education Benefits).

The AOJ denied the Veteran's application for Chapter 33 benefits in April 2023 pursuant to the provisions outlined above under 38 U.S.C. § 21.9520.  That is, because the Veteran's only period of service from April 2016 to April 2022 was used to establish eligibility for receipt of Chapter 30 educational assistance benefits, that same period cannot be used to establish separate entitlement to Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 21.9520; see also 38 U.S.C. § 3322(h)(1).

However, there are also provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 3327 that provide that an individual who meets the minimum service requirements for basic eligibility for Chapter 33 educational assistance, and who is eligible for educational assistance under Chapter 30, may receive Chapter 33 educational assistance if he/she makes an irrevocable election to receive benefits under Chapter 33 in lieu of receiving such benefits under Chapter 30.  These provisions further provide that an individual who elects Chapter 33 benefits in lieu of Chapter 30 benefits shall be limited to the number of months of unused entitlement under Chapter 30 as of the date of the election.  38 U.S.C. § 3327(d)(2).

The implementing regulation for 38 U.S.C. § 3327 provides that an individual may make an irrevocable election to receive benefits under Chapter 33 by properly completing a VA Form 22-1990, submitting a transfer-of-entitlement designation under this chapter to the Department of Defense, or submitting a written statement that includes the following: (i) identification information (including name, social security number, and address); (ii) if applicable, an election to receive benefits under Chapter 33 in lieu of benefits under, e.g., the MGIB; (iii) the date the individual wants the election to be effective; and (iv) an acknowledgement that the election is irrevocable (e.g., "I understand that my election is irrevocable and may not be changed.").  38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(c)(2).

In this case, the Board finds that the Veteran's April 25, 2023 VA Form 22-1990 (Application for VA Education Benefits) includes his identifying information and shows that he applied for Chapter 33 benefits in lieu of Chapter 30 benefits.  The form also shows April 25, 2023, as the date the Veteran wanted the election to be effective and it includes his acknowledgement that his election is irrevocable and may not be changed.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran has properly executed an irrevocable election of Chapter 33 or Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits in this case in lieu of Chapter 30 benefits, and he meets the criteria to make the election.  38 U.S.C. § 3327; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(c)(2).

The Board further finds that the provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 3322(h)(1) pertaining to a bar to duplication of eligibility based on a single event or period of service does not prevent the Veteran from electing Chapter 33 benefits in lieu of Chapter 30 benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 3327.  This is so when considering that the intent of 38 U.S.C. § 3322(h)(1) is to prevent an individual from receiving more than 36 months of benefits under different educational programs based on a single period of service.  That is, it is to prevent an individual from receiving 36 months of benefits under Chapter 30 and, after exhausting those benefits, establishing eligibility under Chapter 33, and receiving another 12 months of benefits pursuant to the 48-month-rule for the same period of service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3695(a); Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-377, § 111, 124 Stat. 4106, 4120-21 (Jan. 4, 2011); Rudisill v. McDonough, 2020-1637 (December 15, 2022).  Here, the fact that the Veteran is electing Chapter 33 benefits in lieu of Chapter 30 benefits not in addition to Chapter 30 benefits limits him to the number of months of unused entitlement under Chapter 30, up to 36 months, making the bar to duplication of eligibility for a single period of service under 38 U.S.C. § 3322(h) inapplicable.

In the present case, as of September 5, 2023, the Veteran had 24 months and 3 days of benefits remaining.  See September 2023 Chapter 30 Education Award Report.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable regulations, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran is eligible to receive educational assistance benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and his claim is granted, with the limitation not to exceed the number of months of unused entitlement under Chapter 30.
