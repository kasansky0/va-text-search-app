DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

A 20 percent rating for left ankle sprain with osteochondritis vesicans, calcaneal spur, and post-traumatic arthritis (left ankle arthritis) is granted.

A separate 20 percent rating for left ankle instability is granted.

A 20 percent rating for right achilles tendonitis with degenerative and post-traumatic arthritis (right ankle arthritis), is granted.

A separate 20 percent rating for right ankle instability is granted.

REMANDED

A rating higher than 20 percent for right shoulder tendonitis is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, her left and right ankle arthritis had dorsiflexion limited to 5 degrees or plantar flexion limited to 10 degrees.

2. The Veteran's has left and right ankle instability which equates to ankle sprain or ligament repair and a medical provider prescribed a brace for ambulation.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a 20 percent rating for left ankle arthritis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5271.

2. The criteria for a separate 20 percent rating for left ankle instability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5257.

3. The criteria for a 20 percent rating for right ankle arthritis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5271.

4. The criteria for a separate 20 percent rating for left ankle instability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5257.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1982 to October 1992. Her service decorations include the Air Force Commendation Medal.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for a higher rating for a right shoulder disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Bilateral Ankles

In this matter, the Veteran's bilateral ankles have been assigned a 10 percent rating pursuant to DC 5271 since her 1992 grant of service connection. In July 2023, the Veteran sought higher ratings for her ankle disabilities. She concurrently submitted a lay statement which reported that her ankles severely limited her performance of daily activities, including driving, grocery shopping, and performance of household tasks. Bilateral ankle pain and swelling was reported. 

DC 5271 addresses limitation of motion of the ankle and mandates that a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle (less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion). A 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion).

In December 2023, a VA examination was conducted regarding the Veteran's left and right ankle limitations. Her initial range of motion was documented to be left ankle dorsiflexion to 8 degrees and plantar flexion to 15 degrees. Her right ankle dorsiflexion was to 10 degrees and plantar flexion to 20 degrees. There were no other range of motion estimates provided. The Veteran was reported to have denied flare-ups. She was noted to have stated that she had bilateral ankle pain including when walking and weight bearing. 

Based on the December 2023 VA examination, the Board finds that a 20 percent rating under DC 5271 is appropriate for each ankle. Resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor and in acknowledgment that the VA examination failed to provide any additional estimates of loss of motion, the Board finds that is reasonable to assume the Veteran's left and right dorsiflexion or plantar flexion would have shown limitations such that the 20 percent rating is warranted. This is the maximum rating allowed under DC 5271.

Furthermore, the Board recognizes that the Veteran's December 2023 VA examination reported severe bilateral ankle instability. The examiner noted the Veteran's ankles rolled often. 

DC 5271 does not contemplate ankle instability. Accordingly, the Board finds that a rating by analogy under DC 5257 (instability of the knee) is most appropriate to rate the Veteran's disability picture. DC 5257 provides a 10 percent rating for a sprain incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear with persistent instability without a prescription of an assistive device. A 20 percent rating is assigned with a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability and prescription of an assistive device. A 30 percent rating required an unrepaired or failed ligament tear with persistent instability and a prescribed assistive device. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257.

Based on the findings of the Veteran's December 2023 VA examination, the Board finds that a 20 percent rating for each ankle pursuant to DC 5257 is warranted. The Veteran has a documented left ankle sprain and a right ankle ligament tear. She had documented left and right ankle instability which requires constant use of a brace, which her VA records confirm was prescribed to her. See September 2023 VA medical record. Thus, the Veteran's left and right ankle instability warrants a 20 percent rating under the criteria of DC 5257. 

The Board notes that the amputation rule provides that the combined rating for any disabilities of an extremity shall not exceed the rating for the amputation at that elective level, were amputation to be performed. Because the service-connected ankle disabilities involve the leg below the knee, the combined rating may not exceed 40 percent. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.68, 4.71a, DC 5165. Thus, pursuant to the amputation rule, the combined rating for the ankle disabilities - below the Veteran's knee - may not exceed 40 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.68, 4.71a, DC 5165.

Pursuant to the increased ratings granted in this Decision, the Veteran's combined rating for her left and right ankles is now at 40 percent. Thus, no higher ratings or additional ratings for her left or right ankle are permissible by law as any such rating would violate the amputation rule under 38 C.F.R. § 4.68.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Right Shoulder

As with the examinations of her ankles, the Veteran underwent a VA examination regarding the severity of her right shoulder disability in December 2023. This examination failed to provide any additional range of motion estimates. However, the Board is unable to resolve any doubt in the Veteran's favor which would result in a higher rating, or the maximum rating allowed by law. The Board finds, then, that the December 2023 VA examination is inadequate and represents a pre-decisional duty to assist error which must be corrected on remand. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the current severity of her right shoulder disability. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.

All indicated testing should be accomplished and all symptomatology associated with the disability, to include range of motion test results for both active and passive motion, and in weight bearing and non-weight-bearing, and, recording the range of motion in the opposite, undamaged joint.

In so doing, the examiner must attempt to elicit information regarding the severity, frequency, and duration of any flare-ups, and the degree of functional loss during flare-ups. If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement based on direct observation, the examiner should provide an estimate, if possible, of the additional impairment due to flare-ups based on the other evidence of record and the Veteran's statements. If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

The examiner is asked to consider the July 2023 lay statement regarding the severity of her shoulder disability.
