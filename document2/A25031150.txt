DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

An effective date of March 24, 2019, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for an other specified anxiety disorder with anxious distress (an acquired psychiatric disorder) is granted, pursuant to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On March 24, 2019, VA received an intent to file a claim followed by a claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. The claim was denied in a July 29, 2019 rating decision. 

2. On August 4, 2020, VA received the Veteran's Supplemental Claim requesting that his March 24, 2019 claim be reopened. Therein, due to COVID-19, he requested an extension on the one-year requirement to file his challenge to the AOJ's July 29, 2019 adverse decision. Along with his request, the Veteran attached an April 2020 VA press release regarding claims extensions during the COVID-19 national emergency.  

3. The appellant's one year to appeal the July 2019 decision fell within the COVID-19 national emergency declaration.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of March 24, 2019 for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2013 to January 2017. 

In the August 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

An effective date of March 24, 2019, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is granted.

The Veteran is service connected for an acquired psychiatric disorder, effective August 4, 2020. He contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date. The Board agrees. 

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on a claim for compensation is to be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but not earlier than the date the claim was received. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a). Where a claimant continuously pursues a claim, entitlement may be considered from the date of receipt of the initial claim; however, in order to use supplemental claims to continuously pursue review of an issue and thereby protect the earliest possible effective date in the event of an award of benefits, the supplemental claims must be filed within one year of notification of the last AOJ or Board decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h).

The Board notes the following, relevant procedural history. 

On March 24, 2019, VA received an intent to file a claim followed by a claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. The claim was denied in a July 29, 2019 rating decision. 

On August 4, 2020, VA received the Veteran's Supplemental Claim requesting that his March 24, 2019 claim be reopened. Therein, due to COVID-19, he requested an extension on the one-year requirement to file his challenge to the AOJ's July 2019 adverse decision. Along with his request, the Veteran cited and attached an April 3, 2020 VA press release regarding claim extensions during the COVID-19 national emergency. Therein, VA noticed that veterans were permitted to submit their paperwork late for the following actions: (1) perfecting claims; (2) challenging adverse decisions; (3) submitting Notices of Disagreement; (4) submitting Substantive Appeals; and (5) responding to Supplemental Statements of the Case. The press release also noted that veterans requesting claim extensions could simply submit them with any late-filed paperwork; veterans did not have to proactively request an extension in advance. 

Ultimately, the AOJ granted the Veteran's claim for service-connection, effective August 4, 2020. However, the AOJ never acknowledged the Veteran's initial extension request. 

(Continued on next page) 

While the Veteran's August 2020 Supplemental Claim was filed more than one year after the July 2019 rating decision, he properly requested an extension of time due to the COVID-19 national emergency. Therefore, the Board finds that the initial date of claim should be preserved as the effective date for the grant of service connection. Accordingly, the claim is granted.
