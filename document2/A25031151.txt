FINDING OF FACT

In April 2023, the Veteran failed without good cause to report for scheduled VA examinations in conjunction with his claims for increased disability ratings for service-connected lumbar spine, right ankle, left ankle, right knee, and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for arthritis of the lumbar spine have not been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

2. The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right ankle strain have not been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

3. The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left ankle strain have not been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

4. The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee strain have not been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655. 

5. The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy have not been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1977 to September 1997.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

Legal Criteria - Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10. 

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991). 

If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. 

When a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with a claim for increase, the claim will be denied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).  A claimant has some responsibility to cooperate in the development of all facts pertinent to his claim and that the duty to assist is not a one-way street. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 191 (1991). 

Procedural History

In a May 2014 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for lumbar spine, left ankle sprain, and right ankle sprain disabilities, each rated 10 percent disabling, effective August 6, 2012.   

The Veteran did not initiate an appeal of the May 2014 rating decision, nor was relevant evidence received within the requisite period.  Therefore, the May 2014 rating decision became final. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d).  

In an August 2019 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), the Veteran requested increased ratings for service-connected lumbar spine and bilateral ankle disabilities, and service connection for right knee.  In an October 2019 rating decision, the RO increased the assigned disability rating for lumbar spine from 10 percent to 40 percent, effective August 23, 2019; continued assigned 10 percent ratings for right and left ankle disabilities; and granted service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, rated 10 percent, effective August 23, 2019.  In a February 2020 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for right knee strain, rated 10 percent, effective August 23, 2019.

The Veteran did not initiate appeals of either October 2019 or February 2020 rating decisions within one year, nor was relevant evidence received within the requisite period.  Therefore, October 2019 and February 2020 rating decisions became final.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d).  

In a March 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), the Veteran requested increased ratings for service-connected lumbar spine, right ankle, left ankle, right knee, and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities.  In a July 2023 rating decision, the RO denied increased ratings for these disabilities. The Veteran submitted a July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement with the denial giving rise to the present appeal before the Board.

Analysis - Lumbar Spine, Bilateral Ankle, Right Knee, Right Lower Extremity Radiculopathy

The Veteran requests increased ratings for his service-connected lumbar spine, right ankle, left ankle, right knee, and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities.  See March 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). In support of the appeal, he submitted private disability benefit questionnaires, but did not undergo physical examination.  See March 2023 Correspondence.

To assist in determining the current severity of service-connected lumbar spine, right ankle, left ankle, right knee, and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities, in April 2023 the RO requested contemporaneous VA examinations. The Veteran was scheduled for these examinations; however, in April 2023 he cancelled the scheduled examinations.  No explanation was provided for the cancellation.  The July 2023 rating decision on appeal noted the Veteran's failure to report to scheduled VA examinations.  

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.655, when entitlement or continued entitlement to a benefit cannot be established or confirmed without a current VA examination or reexamination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination scheduled in conjunction with an original compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. When the examination was scheduled in conjunction with any other original claim, a reopened claim for a benefit which was previously disallowed, or a claim for increase, the claim shall be denied absent a showing of good cause. Here, the matter before the Board are claims for increase.

The record does not reflect that the Veteran attempted to reschedule the VA examinations, and neither the Veteran nor counsel has provided any good cause for his failure to report to the examinations. "The duty to assist is not always a one-way street," and claimants are expected to comply with reasonable requests. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. at 191.

As the Veteran failed to report for VA lumbar spine, right ankle, left ankle, right knee, and right lower extremity radiculopathy examinations scheduled in conjunction with his claims for increased ratings without good cause, the claims must be denied as a matter of law. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655; Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
