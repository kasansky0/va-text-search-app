ORDER

Entitlement to an evaluation of 30 percent, prior to August 25, 2016, is granted.

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for headaches, residual of closed head injury, from August 25, 2016, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During the period of prior to August 25, 2016, the Veteran experienced headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average once a month over this timeframe; very frequent prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability is not shown.

2. For the period from August 25, 2016, the headaches did not manifest in characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an evaluation of 30 percent, but not higher, for headaches, residual of closed head injury, prior to August 25, 2016, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.10, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for headaches, residual of closed head injury, from August 25, 2016, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.10, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army from September 1982 to September 1992. 

In March 2019, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) continued its 10 percent evaluation for headaches, residual of closed head injury.

In May 2019, the Veteran submitted a request for higher-level review.

In June 2019, the AOJ in its rating decision continued its evaluation of 10 percent for headaches, residual of closed head injury.

In the August 16, 2019, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A May 2024 notification advised the Veteran that a hearing was scheduled for August 14, 2024. The Veteran did not appear for the scheduled Board hearing.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2019 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] within 90 days following the date of the scheduled hearing. 38?C.F.R. §?20.302(c). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date of the scheduled Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the date of the scheduled hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(c), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to an evaluation of 30 percent, but not higher, for headaches, residual of closed head injury, prior to August 25, 2016, is granted.

2. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for headaches, residual of closed head injury, from August 25, 2016, is denied.

The Veteran's headaches, residual of closed head injury, is currently assigned a 10 percent evaluation pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100. Headaches are rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100, for migraine. Under DC 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks. A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months. A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months. A 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. A 50 percent rating is the highest schedular rating under DC 8100.

The rating criteria of DC 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30?Vet. App.?245, 252 (2018). This renders 38?C.F.R. §§?4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable. Id.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under DC 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation. Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The rating criteria for a 50 percent rating contain several undefined phrases. The descriptive phrase "very frequent" connotes a frequency at least greater than once a month, as is required by the rating criteria corresponding to a lesser 30 percent rating. Johnson v. Wilkie, supra at 253. The phrase "completely prostrating" generally means that the migraines attack must render the veteran entirely powerless. Id. The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract."  Id. (internal citation omitted). Lastly, the 50 percent rating criteria requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability." Productive can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in DC 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating. Pierce v. Principi, 18?Vet. App.?440, 445-46 (2004).

In Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 67 (2020), the CAVC held that DC 8100 contemplates all migraine symptoms.  Therefore, to evaluate migraines under DC 8100, VA must consider all symptoms experienced due to migraine attacks and then rate the symptoms based on the frequency, duration, and economic impact of those attacks.

As a procedural starting point for this claim, on August 12, 2009, the Veteran submitted an informal claim for increased rating for headaches, which was service connected in March 2009. The current appeal period begins on August 12, 2009, the day the Veteran submitted his claim for an increased rating and includes the one-year "look back" period. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

As part of this one-year "look back" period, in August 2008, the Veteran underwent a neurological disorders VA examination. The Veteran reported having headaches about two to three times a week. The VA examiner noted that the severity of the headaches is about a 7 or 8 out of 10 with a duration of one hour. Also, the VA examiner remarked that the Veteran lies down and tries to sleep the headaches off. Moreover, during the examination, the Veteran commented that he missed up to 20 hours of work due to his headaches.

In October 2009, the Veteran underwent a neurological disorders VA examination. During the examination, the Veteran reported that his headaches reached a frequency of four to five times per week. The Veteran stated that medications made the headaches worse and that sleeping alleviated his symptoms. The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's headache severity is less than half of the attacks are prostrating.

In October 2009, the Veteran submitted a headache diary. The Veteran registered headache episodes from June 2, 2009, to October 4, 2009. Out of the sixteen listed episodes, seven of them were severe and five were moderate. Specifically, in the episodes of June 2, 2009; June 5, 2009; June 6, 2009; June 7, 2009; June 10, 2009; June 12, 2009; and June 14, 2009, the Veteran stated that he had to stop working or take the day off because of his headache episodes.

In December 2009, the AOJ in its rating decision increased its evaluation of headaches, residual of closed head injury to 10 percent effective August 13, 2009.

In September 2010, the Veteran underwent a medical examination. The examiner noted that when a headache occurs, the Veteran cannot stand right and tolerate noise. Moreover, the examiner commented that when the headaches occur, the Veteran is able to work but requires medication. Equally, the examiner acknowledged that the Veteran cannot work at times due to pain. The examiner remarked that the Veteran described his headache pain as 10 on a scale of 1-10. In addition, the examiner mentioned that the Veteran experiences headaches on average, once a day and can last for 15 minutes.

In October 2012, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement for his increased rating claim of headaches.

In January 2015, the AOJ issued its statement of the case (SOC) in which it continued its 10 percent evaluation for headaches due to closed head injury.

In February 2015, the Veteran submitted a Form 9 to appeal the issue of an increased rating for headaches.

In August 2016, the Veteran underwent a headaches VA examination. The VA examiner noted a diagnosis for traumatic headaches. During the examination, the Veteran reported frontal headache with throbbing pain and that he is taking medication for the condition. The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran does not have characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine or non-migraine headache pain. Also, the VA examiner remarked that the Veteran's headache condition does not impact his ability to work.

In March 2018, the Veteran opted to have his pending Legacy appeal reviewed under the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP). The Veteran selected the higher level review of the prior denial. In electing participation under RAMP, the Veteran withdrew the prior Legacy appeal.

In August 2018, the AOJ in its rating decision continued its 10 percent evaluation for headaches, residual of closed head injury.

In February 2019, the Veteran underwent a headaches VA examination. The VA examiner noted a diagnosis for headaches, status post of a closed head injury. The Veteran stated that his condition has gotten worse over time but has not had to miss work or be admitted to the hospital for this condition. Also, the Veteran reported that he takes medication for his headaches. In terms of symptoms, the VA examiner highlighted that the Veteran experiences sharp pain on both sides of the head. Also, the VA examiner indicated that the duration of typical head pain is less than one day. Moreover, the VA examiner determined that the Veteran does not have characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain. Furthermore, the VA examiner remarked that the Veteran does not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability. Lastly, the VA examiner commented that the Veteran's headaches does not impact his ability to work.

In March 2019, the AOJ in its rating decision continued its 10 percent evaluation for headaches, residual of closed head injury.

In May 2019, the Veteran submitted a request for higher-level review.

In June 2019, the AOJ in its rating decision continued its evaluation of 10 percent for headaches, residual of closed head injury. The AOJ indicated that the preponderance of the evidence shows non-prostrating attacks of migraine or non-migraine pain.

In August 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

On August 14, 2024, the Board had scheduled a Board hearing that the Veteran did not show up. 

In August 2024, the Veteran's representative submitted an appellate brief. The representative stated that the Veteran is entitled to a 50 percent rating for headaches. The representative highlighted various instances in the record which illustrate the severity of the Veteran's headaches across the appeal period. Also, the representative mentioned that that the Veteran's difficulties with employment due to his headaches are well documented. Consequently, the representative cited a May 2010 statement in support of claim in which the Veteran indicated that due to his military related injury he is not able to work. Thus, the representative argued that entitlement to a total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) was raised as early as 2010.

Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran has had headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average of at least once a month during the period encompassing prior to August 25, 2016, therefore corresponding to the criteria for a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 8100. As mentioned before, the August 2008 VA examination shows that the Veteran had two or three headaches a week that caused him to lie down impacted his ability to show up to work. Also, the October 2009 VA examination illustrates that the Veteran had headaches four to five times per week and that sleeping alleviated his symptoms. Moreover, the Veteran's October 2009 headache diary listed at least eleven episodes between June 2009 to October 2009 in which his symptoms were either moderate or severe. Furthermore, the Veteran indicated that in various episodes in June 2009 he had to take the day off from work because of his headache episodes. In addition, in the headaches diary, the Veteran indicates that on multiple occasions he simply had to lay down or try to sleep to alleviate his symptoms. Lastly, the September 2010 examination cites that the Veteran had daily headaches in which he cannot stand right or tolerate noise. 

The Board finds that the Veteran is competent to report his headaches with a frequency of four to five headaches episodes a week. Moreover, the evidence of record persuades the Board to conclude that the headaches episodes during this period produced extreme exhaustion or powerlessness. Thus, the Board determines that the Veteran's description of prostrating headaches that occurred at least once a month is sufficient to satisfy the criteria for a 30 percent disability rating. Lastly, in this regard, the Board wants to reiterate that the Veteran is competent to report readily observable symptoms. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

For this period, a 50 percent evaluation is not warranted because the evidence of record does not demonstrate that the Veteran's headaches result in very frequently completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. As mentioned before, even though there were instances that the Veteran's headaches prevented him from going to work, the overall picture during this period does not render for a conclusion that he was consistently unable to produce or being able to produce in a work or employment setting.

In regard to the period from August 25, 2016, the Board finds that an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for headaches is not warranted. The Board wants to highlight that on August 25, 2016, the medical evidence first makes the clear distinction that the Veteran has not had characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine or non-migraine headache pain. Moreover, the lay statements from the Veteran do not show that during this period he suffered from headache episodes that produced extreme exhaustion or powerless. Equally, a February 2019 VA examination reiterates that the Veteran did not have miss work because of his headaches and that he did not suffer from characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine or non-migraine headache pain. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran consistently has had symptoms in relation to his headaches. However, for the period starting on August 25, 2016, the medical and lay evidence has not demonstrated that characteristic prostrating attacks averaging in 2 months over the last several months. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the Veteran's headaches result in very frequently completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability, which would entail an evaluation of 50 percent.

On a separate note, the Veteran's representative argued that TDIU must be inferred since 2010 from the record pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). First, it is important to mention that in or around 2010 the evidence does not show that the Veteran was completely unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service connected headaches, residual of closed head injury. The September 2010 examination indicates that even though the Veteran could not work at times due to his headaches, he was able to work by taking the appropriate medications. Thus, a claim for TDIU cannot be reasonably inferred from the September 2010 VA examination. Moreover, it is crucial to highlight that in January 2015, while the appeal for an increased rating for his headaches was still pending, the Veteran made an express claim for TDIU and listed his headaches condition as a disability that prevented him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation. Later in July 2015, the AOJ in its rating decision denied entitlement to individual unemployability. If the Veteran would like to reopen the claim of a TDIU, he has the option to file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) to submit new and relevant evidence and have the AOJ consider any evidence not previously considered. Specific instructions are included in this decision. 

Given the foregoing, a 30 percent evaluation, but not higher, for the period of August 13, 2009, to August 25, 2016, for headaches, residual of closed head injury 

?

is granted. On the other hand, an evaluation in excess of 10 percent from August 25, 2016, for headaches, residual of closed head injury, is denied.
