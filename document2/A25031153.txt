ORDER

The reduction of the 100 percent rating for prostate cancer was proper; the appeal is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for prostate cancer residuals is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's treatment for prostate cancer ended in July 2021. 

2. The Veteran's prostate cancer residuals did not require the use of an appliance, the wearing of absorbent materials that must be changed more than 4 times per day, or renal dysfunction.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The reduction of a 100 percent rating for prostate cancer was proper. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7528.

2. The criteria for a rating in excess of 40 percent for prostate cancer residuals have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Air Force from March 1966 to December 1969.

The matters on appeal arise before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2024 rating decision.

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Propriety of the reduction from 100 percent to 40 percent effective September 1, 2024.

The Veteran was originally awarded a 100 percent rating for prostate cancer under Diagnostic Code 7528, which provides a 100 percent rating for malignant neoplasms of the genitourinary system. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b.  The 100 percent was reduced to 40% effective September 1, 2024.

Diagnostic Code 7528 provides that a rating of 100 percent shall continue beyond the cessation of any surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy, or other therapeutic procedure with a mandatory VA examination at the expiration of six months. If there is no local recurrence or metastasis, the condition is to be rated on such residuals as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant.

Initially, the Board notes that the claim at issue is not a formal reduction under the substantive provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.343 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 because the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528 contain a temporal element for continuance of a 100 percent rating. Therefore, the AOJ's action was not a "rating reduction" as that term in commonly understood. See Rossiello v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 430, 433 (1992). In this case, the Board must only determine if the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) were met and if the reduction was by operation of law under Diagnostic Code 7528.

In Foster v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 338, 345 (2021), the Court determined that the plain language of Diagnostic Code 7528 imposed four requirements for discontinuing a 100 percent disability rating for prostate cancer: (1) a claimant's treatment has stopped, (2) VA has provided a mandatory 6-month examination, (3) VA has provided § 3.105(e) notice, and (4) if a claimant has no recurrence or metastasis of his prostate cancer, VA rates residuals as voiding or renal dysfunction.

In this regard, VA regulations provide that, where the reduction in evaluation of a service-connected disability is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made, rating action will be taken. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). The reduction will be made effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the payee expires. Id. The Veteran will be notified of the proposed reduction, as well as the fact that he may request a predetermination hearing and that he has 60 days to present evidence showing why the reduction should not be implemented. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), 3.105(i).

In the instant case, the Board finds that the AOJ complied with 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). Specifically, the Veteran was informed of the proposed action in the April 2023 rating decision. A May 2023 Correspondence shows the Veteran requested an informal hearing due to the proposal to reduce the Veteran's benefits.  The Veteran subsequently stated that he no longer wanted a hearing.  See June 2024 Report of General Information.  

Thereafter, the reduction was effectuated in the June 2024 rating decision, which reduced the rating assigned for the Veteran's prostate cancer from 100 percent to 40 percent effective September 1, 2024. Thus, the Board finds that the notice requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) have been met.

Additionally, the Veteran was provided a mandatory review VA examination in March 2023, at which time it was noted that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2019, he had transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in 2002 and 2014, had completed radiation therapy in July 2019, had completed androgen deprivation therapy (hormone therapy) in July 2021, and his cancer prostate had been in remission since such treatments. However, the examiner reported that, since such treatments, the Veteran had residual conditions or complications due to his prostate cancer or treatment, to include voiding dysfunction. Based on such examination, the Veteran was assigned a 40 percent rating for his prostate cancer residuals.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's rating for his service-connected prostate cancer was properly reduced. The Veteran's prostate cancer treatment had ceased more than six months prior to the effective date of the reduction (September 1, 2024), and his cancer was in remission for the duration of the period on appeal. Additionally, the April 2023 proposal satisfied notice requirements, and the decrease took effect more than eight months following the notice. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).  As noted, the typical regulations governing rating reductions do not apply to a decrease of a 100 percent rating under DC 7528. See Foster, 34 Vet. App. at 345-46. Accordingly, the appeal is denied.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for prostate cancer residuals is denied.

The Veteran is current in receipt of a 40 percent rating for prostate cancer residuals effective September 1, 2024.

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found-a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509 (2007). Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart, 21 Vet. App at 509-10.

Initially, the Board notes the Veteran does not contend, nor does the medical evidence show, that his prostate cancer has reoccurred or metastasized. The Veteran's Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) remained <0.1. See March 2023 and October 2023 VA examination reports.  Additionally, VA examination reports from March 2023 and October 2023 show the Veteran's prostate cancer was in remission. As such, a 100 percent disability rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 7528, and it is appropriate to rate the Veteran's residuals as either voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction.

The Board notes certain regulations pertaining to the evaluation of genitourinary system disabilities were amended during the pendency of the appeal on November 14, 2021. However, according to the medical evidence of record, the Veteran's prostate cancer residuals have not been manifested by renal dysfunction during the appeal period and, therefore, the regulations affected by the amendment are not applicable to the current case. Therefore, his prostate cancer residuals are to be rated as voiding dysfunction, which is based on urine leakage, urinary frequency, or obstructed voiding. The Board also notes that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction, another prostate cancer residual, is separately evaluated and not currently on appeal.

Continual urine leakage requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed less than 2 times per day warrants a 20 percent rating. A 40 percent rating is warranted for the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed 2 to 4 times per day, and a 60 percent rating is warranted if the use of an appliance is required or if the absorbent materials need to be changed more than 4 times per day. Urinary frequency resulting in a daytime voiding interval between 1 and 2 hours or awakening to void 3 to 4 times per night warrants a 20 percent rating. A 40 percent rating is warranted for a daytime voiding interval of less than 1 hour or awakening to void 5 or more times per night. Obstructed voiding with urinary retention requiring intermittent or continuous catheterization warrants a 30 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528.

Relevant Evidence

In the March 2023 VA examination report, the examiner noted voiding dysfunction that caused increased urinary frequency with a daytime voiding interval between 1 and 2 hours, and nighttime awakening to void 3 to 4 times.  The voiding dysfunction also caused signs or symptoms of obstructed voiding, including hesitancy, slow stream, weak stream, decreased force of stream.  The examiner confirmed that the Veteran's primary prostate cancer was in remission.  He had completed treatment, with the TURP surgery in 2002 and September 2014, radiation therapy completed in July 2019, and androgen deprivation therapy (hormonal therapy) completed in July 2021.  A February 14, 2019, biopsy showed adenocarcinoma present in 9 of 12 biopsied sites with a PSA level of 28.5 on 1/25/2019.  PSA level was <0.1 on 1/25/2023.  The functional impact of the condition was urinary symptoms that always required proximity to a restroom. The examiner also noted no use of an appliance.

In the October 2023 VA examination report, the examiner noted voiding dysfunction due to prostate cancer treatment that caused urine leakage that required absorbent material which must be changed 2 to 4 times per day.  The voiding dysfunction also caused increased urinary frequency with daytime voiding interval less than 1 hour, and nighttime awakening to void 3 to 4 times.  The voiding dysfunction caused signs or symptoms to include hesitancy, slow stream, weak stream, decreased force of stream.  The examiner noted retracted penis deformity and abnormal, enlarged on DRE prostate.  His primary prostate cancer was in remission.  He completed treatment for prostate cancer, with TURP surgery in 2002 and 2014, radiation therapy completed in July 2019, and androgen deprivation therapy completed in July 2021.  He had no other residuals or complications apart from his service-connected erectile dysfunction.  A January 2023 test showed a PSA of <0.1.  The functional impact was that he lost 0-1-week work time lost in the last 12 months due to urinary dysfunction that limited his productivity due to the need for frequent bathroom privileges. The examiner also noted no use of an appliance.   

VA treatment records show the Veteran's prostate cancer is stable and in remission.  See, e.g., February 2023 VA treatment record.

Legal Analysis and Conclusion

Based on consideration of all evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms most nearly approximate the Veteran's current 40 percent rating effective September 1, 2024. This evaluation is based upon urine leakage requiring the wearing of absorbent material which must be changed 2 to 4 times per day. Such criterion was shown both on examination and by the Veteran's lay description of his condition. A higher rating is not warranted unless the Veteran requires the use of an appliance or his absorbent material must be changed more than 4 times per day, neither of which is indicated by the record.

The Board notes that the other two subcategories of voiding dysfunction voiding frequency and obstructed voiding do not provide for ratings in excess of 40 percent. Also, as noted above, the Veteran's condition does not result in renal dysfunction, so a higher rating pursuant to those criteria is not warranted. Additionally, he is already service connected for erectile dysfunction. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. In sum, a rating in excess of 40 percent effective September 1, 2024, for prostate cancer in remission with residuals of urinary incontinence is not warranted.
