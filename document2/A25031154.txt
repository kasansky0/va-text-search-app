DOCKET NO. 241028-485989
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hypertension is proximately due to his service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder with generalized anxiety.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hypertension as secondary to post-traumatic stress disorder with generalized anxiety are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from June 1965 to December 1968.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sincerely thanks the Veteran for his honorable service to our country.

This case comes before the Board on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

This matter has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.8009(c).

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Here the Board notes that the Veteran has validly waived his right to select a different Board review option.  See October 2024 VA Form 10182

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran specifically contends that his hypertension is caused by his service connected post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with generalized anxiety.  See February 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  The evidence must show that a current disability exists and that the current disability was either caused by or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Pursuant to the AMA, the Board is bound by previous findings of fact that are favorable to the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801.  Here, the AOJ has found and conceded both that the Veteran is currently diagnosed with hypertension and that the Veteran is currently service connected for the underlying disability of PTSD with generalized anxiety.  See July 2024 Rating Decision.

Therefore, the only question before the Board is whether the Veteran's hypertension was caused or aggravated by his PTSD with generalize anxiety.

The Veteran has received two VA examinations for hypertension, in April 2024 and in June 2024.

The April 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's hypertension is at least as likely as not due to his anxiety disability, explaining "rationale is that studies show that increased stress and anxiety are known to increase the risk of developing hypertension."  See April 2024 VA Examination.

The June 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's hypertension is less likely than not due to his service connected mental health condition, explaining that "while having anxiety can increase hypertension, the Veteran more likely than not would have developed hypertension without anxiety with70-79% of men having developed hypertension by age 55."  See June 2024 VA Examination.  The examiner went on to list, at length, various risk factors for hypertension.  Id. 

The June 2024 examiner appears to have rendered a negative opinion based on the fact that they were unable to say with certainty that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD with generalized anxiety is the sole or primary cause of his hypertension.  However, this is not the correct legal standard.  The Board highlights that the Federal Circuit has held that there is a difference between the "as likely as not" adjudication standard and a determination that something is medically or scientifically certain.  See Hodges v. Sec'y of Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 9 F. 3d 958, 965 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Newman, J. dissenting); Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 388 n.1 (2016).  

To summarize, both VA examiners concluded that the Veteran's service connected mental health condition is at least a contributing factor to his hypertension.

Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board therefore finds that the evidence both for and against his claim is at least approximately balanced; therefore, the claim for entitlement to service connection for hypertension as secondary to post-traumatic stress disorder with generalized anxiety is hereby GRANTED.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).
