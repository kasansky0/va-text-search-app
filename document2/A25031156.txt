DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a respiratory/pulmonary disability claimed as lung condition and asthma (other than bronchitis or service-connected allergic rhinitis) is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for chronic bronchitis due to herbicide exposure is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The record as of now does not show that the Veteran has a diagnosis of a respiratory/pulmonary disability (other than bronchitis or service-connected allergic rhinitis).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a respiratory/pulmonary disability (other than bronchitis or service-connected allergic rhinitis) are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army from March 1969 to March 1971.

The matters on appeal arise before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2024 rating decision.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the chronic bronchitis claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the chronic bronchitis claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a link between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 293 (2013).

Service connection may also be granted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d). Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a respiratory/pulmonary disability claimed as lung condition and asthma (other than bronchitis or service-connected allergic rhinitis) is denied.

For this claim, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2023. No current diagnosis for a respiratory/pulmonary disability claimed as lung condition and asthma (other than bronchitis or service-connected allergic rhinitis) was noted. Moreover, a September 2003 VA treatment record confirms no COPD or asthma diagnosis or any lung problem.  On this basis, the Board finds the evidence does not reflect a current diagnosis of a respiratory/pulmonary disability claimed as lung condition and asthma (other than bronchitis or service-connected allergic rhinitis) for which service connection may be granted.

As there is no evidence of a respiratory/pulmonary disability claimed as lung condition and asthma (other than bronchitis or service-connected allergic rhinitis) or any indicated relevant symptom that would cause functional impairment of earning capacity the appeal must be denied. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for chronic bronchitis due to herbicide exposure is remanded.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board must remand to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors, such as providing an inadequate VA examination or opinion. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (c)(1)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). A Telephone VA Disability Benefits Questionnaire and an etiology opinion were obtained in December 2023. 

However, the Board finds that the December 2023 VA examiner's negative etiology opinion is inadequate to decide the claim. The December 2023 VA examiner stated that the "Veteran is conceded as having had exposure to recent agents during deployment, however, this does not represent an established primary etiology of the condition.  The condition is more likely secondary to the chronic cigarette smoking."  See December 2023 VA medical opinion.   

The standard of review is not whether the herbicide agent is a primary etiology of the condition; the standard of review is whether the weight of the medical evidence both for and against a conclusion is so evenly divided that it is as medically sound to find in favor of the conclusion as it is to find against the conclusion. The opinion does not comport with the proper standard and, therefore, remanded is warranted to secure an additional adequate medical opinion.  

Therefore, the claim must be remanded for a new opinion. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a new etiology opinion from a new examiner to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's chronic bronchitis. The claims file must be made available to the examiner for review of the case. All examination findings, along with the complete rationale for all opinions expressed, should be set forth in the examination report. 

After reviewing the claims folder, the examiner is specifically instructed to provide the following information:

 Is it "at least as likely as not" that the Veteran's chronic bronchitis BEGAN IN or is related to his time in the service, including his conceded herbicide exposure, yes, or no?

Any opinion expressed must "contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two." See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).

If the requested opinion cannot be rendered without resorting to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is caused by a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge, i.e., no one could respond given medical science and the known facts, or by a deficiency in the record or the examiner, i.e., additional facts are required, or the examiner does not have the needed knowledge or training. Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 389 (2010) (The Agency of Original Jurisdiction should ensure that any additional evidentiary development suggested by the examiner be undertaken so that a definite opinion can be obtained.)
