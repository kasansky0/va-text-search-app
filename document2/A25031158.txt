REMAND

The issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2013 to April 2015, from February 2019 to January 2020, from July 2020 to March 2021, and from December 2021 to March 2022.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2023 decision.  In October 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2023 decision.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the June 2023 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

The Veteran generally asserts he has sleep apnea due to his service and has reported that his girlfriend tells him it sounds like he "stops breathing" while he is sleeping. See September 2022 VA Form 526EZ. 

Remand of this claim is necessary to fulfill a statutory duty that has a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

Specifically, section 303 of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT?Act) provides that if a covered veteran submits a claim for service connection with evidence of disability and evidence of participation in a toxic exposure risk activity, then VA shall obtain a medical opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that there is a nexus between the disability and the toxic exposure risk activity.?38?U.S.C. §?1168. 

Here, the Veteran is a "covered veteran" as that term is defined in 38 U.S.C. § 1119. See September 2022 VA Form 526EZ; January 2023 and December 2022 VA Memorandum. Although he does not have a confirmed diagnosis of sleep apnea, specifically, he has described sleep disturbances which can reasonably be interpreted as evidence of a disability, however diagnosed. As the exception described in 38 U.S.C. § 1168(b) does not apply to sleep apnea in this instance, an examination that meets the 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a) requirements is needed on remand. See VBA Letter 20-24-06, Updated Guidance on Processing Claims Involving Public Law 117-168, Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022, or the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, 89 Fed. Reg. 51224 (June 17, 2024) (detailing the four situations in which VA currently finds no indication of an association between the claimed disability and a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA)).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his sleep disturbances, claimed as sleep apnea.  After reviewing the claims file, performing a physical examination of the Veteran, and conducting any indicated tests, the examiner is asked to address the following:

(Continued on the next page)

?

Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's sleep apnea and/or any symptoms of sleep disturbance that cause functional impairment of earning capacity were incurred in or caused by an in-service injury, event, or illness, to include in-service TERA?  Please explain why or why not, specifically considering and discussing the Veteran's total potential toxic exposure throughout his military service and the synergistic, combined effect of all of the Veteran's TERAs.  

Please include a complete rationale for the opinion provided.  If you cannot provide the requested opinion without resorting to speculation, please expressly indicate this and state why it is so.
