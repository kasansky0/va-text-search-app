REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disorder is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from June 1983 to June 1986.

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim for service connection for a right knee disorder most recently addressed in a November 2016 rating decision.  In March 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim herein, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disorder is remanded.

In October 2014, the Veteran was last afforded a VA examination to evaluate the etiology of his right knee disorder.  The examiner diagnosed right knee arthritis and rendered a negative nexus opinion.  The examiner explained that the Veteran's in-service 1984 right knee injury had resolved and there were no interval assessment or problems until many years later.  

The Board notes, however, that subsequent to the October 2014 VA examination and prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran submitted a lay statement and private treatment records reflecting his reports that he has had right knee symptoms since active duty.  See November 2023 Statement in Support of Claim and November 2010, August 2018, and August 2021 Private Treatment records.  As the March 2014 VA examiner did not have the opportunity to review the Veteran's statement and private treatment records, the Board finds the October 2014 VA medical opinion to be incomplete and insufficient for adjudication purposes.  As this constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, remand is warranted for a new VA medical opinion consistent with the directives herein.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a VA medical opinions from appropriate examiner to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right knee disorder.  The claims folder (including a copy of this remand) must be provided to and reviewed by the examiner.

The examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's right knee disorder is related to his military service, to specifically include his 1984 right knee injury.  

In rendering the above opinion, the examiner must consider and discuss the Veteran's reports of having right knee pain since service.  See November 2023 Statement in Support of Claim and November 2010, August 2018, and August 2021 Private Treatment records.

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms/history and that such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion.  If the Veteran's reports are discounted, the examiner should provide a reason for doing so.

A rationale for all requested opinions shall be provided. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resorting to mere speculation, he or she shall provide a complete explanation stating why this is so.  In so doing, the examiner shall explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information or that he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that particular question.
