ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating higher than 20 percent for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for left ankle scars is denied.

Entitlement to a disability rating higher than 10 percent for residuals of left ankle fracture status post surgical repair is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy is manifest by symptoms comparable to no more than moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve. 

2. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's left ankle scars covered an area of less than 144 square inches (929 sq. cm), were not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, and did not result in functional impairments or other disabling effects uncontemplated by other ratings. 

3. The Veteran's left ankle condition did not manifest with marked limited motion of the ankle; rather, the Veteran's left ankle dorsiflexion was measured at 5 degrees or more and plantar flexion was measured at 10 degrees or more. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating higher than 20 percent for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

2. The criteria for a compensable rating for left ankle scars have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

3. The criteria for a rating higher than 10 percent for residuals of left ankle fracture status post surgical repair have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2008 to August 2020. 

The modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies to this matter. 

In the July 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran listed four issues for appeal: (1) denial of a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy from a July 2023 rating decision; (2) denial of a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy from a December 2022 rating decision; (3) denial of a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for residuals of left ankle fracture status post-surgical repair from a December 2022 rating decision; and (4) denial of a compensable disability rating for scars (based on size) related to the Veteran's left ankle fracture from a December 2022 rating decision. 

Following the December 2022 rating decision, in March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), requesting review of certain issues decided in that decision, including, in relevant part, consideration of the Veteran's disability rating for her left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy.  In July 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision. The Veteran's appeal of both rating decisions is procedurally proper. See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). However, because the issue, evidentiary record, and period on appeal are identical as between the appeals of both rating decisions, as to the issue of entitlement to a higher disability rating for her left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy, the Board will construe the Veteran's July 2023 VA Form 10182 as an appeal of the December 2022 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. The HLR decision in July 2023 could only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 decision, which is why the evidentiary record is the same.

Thus, there are three issues on appeal from the December 2022 AOJ rating decision: (1) entitlement to a disability rating higher than 20 percent for left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy; (2) entitlement to a disability rating higher than 10 percent for residuals of a left ankle fracture status post-surgery; and (3) entitlement to a compensable disability rating for left ankle scars. 

In the July 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board observes that the Veteran has continued to pursue higher ratings for her left ankle and left lower extremity radiculopathy (sciatic nerve) conditions while this appeal was pending at the Board. Therefore, there are additional VA examinations and statements submitted by the Veteran to VA after the close of the evidentiary window in this appeal. Such evidence was not considered by the Board, as it is outside both the applicable evidentiary window based on the Veteran's choice of the Direct Review docket and the relevant period on appeal. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The claims before the Board are non-initial claims for increased ratings. The period on review currently before the Board under the AMA is limited to the period considered by the AOJ (i.e., ends at the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal). The review period and the evidentiary windows are distinct concepts in AMA that are not interchangeable (the review period is the time which VA is assigning a rating for the issue on appeal; the evidentiary window is the time which evidence may be submitted and considered for the issue on appeal). Here, the applicable rating period for entitlement to higher ratings for residuals of a left ankle fracture and associated scars is from August 28, 2022, the date the Veteran applied for a higher rating for the service-connected conditions on appeal, through December 21, 2022, the date of the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Likewise, the applicable rating period for entitlement to a higher rating for left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy is from August 3, 2022, the date the Veteran applied for a higher rating for the service-connected condition on appeal, through December 21, 2022, the date of the rating decision on appeal. See id. The Board will generally review evidence from that period and during the one year "look back period" preceding the submission of the claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

1. Entitlement to a disability rating higher than 20 percent for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (sciatic nerve)

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for her left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy. See July 2023 VA Form 10182. As grounds for this increase, the Veteran asserts that the higher-level reviewer indicated that she should receive an evaluation of at least 40 percent. See id. 

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.  Neuritis and neuralgia of that group are evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 8620 and 8720 using the same criteria.  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling.  Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a.  

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

Neither the Rating Schedule nor the regulations provide definitions for descriptive words such as "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe." Spellers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 211, 219 (2018) ("DC 8520 does not define 'mild,' 'moderate,' 'moderately severe,' or 'severe,' or generally associate those terms with specific symptoms"). Although the Board has at times attempted to define these terms using dictionary definitions, those definitions are problematic because they "do little to explain the Board's understanding of these terms and do not 'disclos[e] that benchmark it employed to reach [its] conclusion.'" Casey v. McDonough, No. 21- 7569, slip op. at 3 (Vet. App. Jan. 24, 2023) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.) (quoting Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 255 (2018) (discussing the Board's attempt to define the terms slight, mild, moderate, and severe in DC 8515). See also Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain). With regard to DC 8520, although 38 C.F.R. § 4.120, 4.123, and 4.124 are "helpful in framing the analysis, [they] are not alone sufficient to explain the Board's decision absent an articulated connection to specific evidence." LeMon v. McDonough, No. 21-3949, 2022 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1998, *7 (Dec. 16, 2022) (mem dec) (Toth, J.). As explained in LeMon, these regulations leave gaps in defining the relevant terms that are filled by VA's Adjudication Manual, M21-1: 

The Board "is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases," Overton, 30 Vet. App. at 264. Clearly relevant to this case are M21-1 provisions regarding evaluations of paralysis of the sciatic nerve. The M21-1 describes mild incomplete paralysis as a disability "limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a smaller area." Part V, sbpt. iii, ch. 12, sec. A.2.c. And moderate incomplete paralysis, per the M21-1, should be "reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment," where the sensory involvement covers "a larger area in the nerve distribution." Id. M21-1 examples of a moderate disability include "motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate." Id. And the M21-1 provides that a moderately severe evaluation (that is, a 40% rating) is available when there is "[m]otor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a higher level of limitation or disability." Id. Atrophy may, but need not, be present for a moderately severe rating.

As concluded by the Court in LeMon, given the relevance of these provisions to rating disabilities of the peripheral nerves, "the Board's failure to mention the M21- 1's relevant guidance in this area constitutes clear error." LeMon, at *7-*8. See also Bethea, 2 Vet. App. at 254. The Board will therefore mention, and apply, these definitions in the instant case. 

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type pictured for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves." The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017). 

The Veteran attended a VA examination in August 2022 in which a Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) was completed for Back/Thoracolumbar Spine Conditions. See August 2022 VA Examination. This DBQ considered some elements of peripheral neuropathy, specifically, radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve; however, the Veteran declined to attend a VA examination to specifically address her radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve. See id. See also December 2022 Exam Request. Additionally, the Veteran did not complain of, or receive treatment for, radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve via medical providers with VA during the period on appeal. See, generally, VA Treatment Records. Therefore, the record contains little evidence regarding the severity of her left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy. 

Regarding impairment of motor functions, the Veteran's motor functions of the left lower extremity were all normal. See August 2022 VA Examination.  

Regarding muscle atrophy, there was none. See id. 

Regarding loss of reflexes, the August 2022 VA examination revealed normal reflexes. See id. 

Regarding sensory disturbance, sensation testing for light touch revealed absent sensation of the left upper anterior thigh and decreased sensation of the left thigh/knee and left lower leg/ankle, with otherwise normal sensation. See id. The VA examiner opined the Veteran had severe paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and severe numbness of the left lower extremity. See id.

Regarding pain, the examiner noted that the Veteran had moderate constant pain of the left lower extremity, but otherwise did not have pain. See id. This is consistent with the Veteran's statements regarding pain as recorded by the examiner. See id. 

The record does not contain evidence of trophic changes or complete paralysis during the period on appeal. 

At the informal conference in June 2023, the Veteran reported the left leg locks up at night and she cannot take pain medications, so she has no relief.

As noted above, VA's Adjudication Manual, M21-1 suggests that a moderate disability is appropriate for "the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment," where the sensory involvement covers "a larger area in the nerve distribution." Id. Examples of a moderate disability include "motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate." Id. Whereas the M21-1 provides that "[m]otor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a higher level of limitation or disability" would be suggestive of a moderately severe evaluation. Id.

Here, the Veteran has constant pain and sensory impairment covering a large area (left upper thigh to left lower leg/ankle); however, the evidence does not indicate any motor or reflex impairment. See August 2022 VA Examination (showing normal muscle strength and reflex testing). Therefore, the Veteran's symptoms of left lower extremity radiculopathy during the appeal period more closely approximate the criteria for moderate incomplete paralysis.  

Based on the above, the Board finds that the disability is primarily manifest by moderate constant pain, as well as severe paresthesias/dysesthesias and numbness. The Board also finds that the most probative evidence of record is against a finding that the disability is manifest by impairment of muscle function, trophic changes, loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis. The Board thus finds that the level of impairment is most analogous to moderate incomplete paralysis. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's argument that she should be entitled to a 40 percent rating because the higher-level reviewer indicated that would be a more appropriate rating. However, as previously discussed, the medical evidence of record does not support such a finding, nor did the higher-level reviewer actually conclude such a rating was warranted in the subsequent decision. Therefore, the record before the Board weighs persuasively against the Veteran's argument. 

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected. Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted. In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a disability rating higher than 20 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy (sciatic nerve), and the benefit-of-the doubt rule does not apply.  

2. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for left ankle scars

The Veteran contends that the severity of her left ankle scars warrants a higher disability rating. See July 2023 VA Form 10182. 

The Veteran has four scars on her left ankle from previous left ankle surgeries. These scars have two separate ratings under Diagnostic Codes 7802 (based on size) and 7804 (based on pain). The December 2022 AOJ rating decision considered each of these ratings; however, the Veteran's July 2023 VA Form 10182 only appealed the rating under Diagnostic Code 7802. Because the Veteran did not appeal the rating under 7804, the propriety of this separate rating for painful scars is not before the Board.  

The Veteran's left ankle scars are currently rated as noncompensable under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7802. Under DC 7802, a 10 percent rating is warranted for burn scars or scars due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage and cover an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm) or greater.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118. 

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable disability rating under Diagnostic Code 7802 because the Veteran's left ankle scars do not cover an area of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater. 

In the August 2022 VA examination, the VA examiner identified four left ankle scars. The examiner found that all of the scars were painful, but none were unstable or associated with underlying tissue damage. The VA examiner measured the size of the four scars as: (1) 4 cm x 0.5 cm; (2) 10 cm x 0.2 cm; (3) 1 cm x 0.2 cm; and (4) 1 cm x 0.2 cm. The examiner recorded the total combined area of the left ankle surgical scars as 4.4 sq. cm. The VA examiner found that the scars did not result in limitation of function, to include limitation of motion. The Veteran indicated that, occasionally, the pain and swelling from the scars impacted the Veteran's ability to concentrate at work.  

In the September 2022 VA examination, the VA examiner found that none of the four left ankle scars were unstable, nor were they associated with any underlying tissue damage. Two of the four scars were painful. The VA examiner measured the size of the scars as follows: (1) 8 cm x 0.3 cm; (2) 1 cm x 0.2 cm; (3) 7 cm x 0.3 cm; and (4) 0.5 cm x 0.2 cm. The combined total area of the four left ankle scars was 4.8 sq. cm. The VA examiner found that the scars did not result in limitation of function, to include limitation of motion, and did not impact the Veteran's ability to work.  

There are no relevant treatment records associated with the claims file during the period on appeal regarding the Veteran's left ankle scars. 

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars. The Board again notes that, in addition to Diagnostic Code 7802, the Veteran's left ankle scars are already rated under Diagnostic Code 7804 for painful or unstable scars. If the Veteran believes she is entitled to a higher disability rating with regard to this rating, she should file a supplemental claim using VA Form 20-0995 and seek review of same. Nevertheless, the Veteran's left ankle scars are not of the head, face, or neck and are not associated with underlying tissue damage. Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7800 and 7801 are inapplicable. Moreover, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effects not considered in a rating already provided as contemplated under Diagnostic Code 7805.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects. However, the Veteran does not assert, and medical treatment or examination records do not show, that the Veteran's left ankle scars cover an area of at least 144 square inches (929 sq. cm). 

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for left ankle scars.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  

3. Entitlement to a disability rating higher than 10 percent for residuals of left ankle fracture status post surgical repair

The Veteran contends that her left ankle condition is worse than her current 10 percent disability rating reflects. See July 2023 VA Form 10182.

The Veteran's left ankle condition (residuals of left ankle fracture status post surgical repair) is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271, for limitation of motion of the ankle.  Under Diagnostic Code 5271, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle (less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion).  A 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion).  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

In September 2022, the Veteran attended a VA examination. In this examination, the Veteran described daily left ankle pain that increases with walking. She reported left ankle swelling and limited range of motion in the left ankle. According to the Veteran, she cannot walk long distances and wears an ankle brace or walking boot for stability.  The VA examiner found that the Veteran's range of motion was limited by pain in the ankle. The Veteran's range of motion, with pain, was measured at plantar flexion limited to 20 degrees and dorsiflexion limited to 10 degrees. The examiner estimated the Veteran's range of motion, at its most limited based on pain and repeated use, to be plantarflexion limited to 15 degrees and dorsiflexion limited to 5 degrees. There was no ankylosis of the ankle. The Veteran reported occupational impacts such as the inability to run and the need to elevate the ankle while at rest. 

The Veteran receives treatment from VA for her ankle condition. During the period on appeal, the Veteran was seen only once for her left ankle condition. In September 2022, the Veteran reported chronic left ankle pain associated with stiffness, numbness, and tingling. In this encounter, the VA provider noted the Veteran had restricted motion of the left ankle in dorsiflexion and supination. The Veteran was encouraged to continue to wear her ankle sleeve for support and use topical anti-inflammatory medication.   

At the June 2023 informal conference, the Veteran stated that her left ankle has been surgically repaired on 6 occasions and she wears an ankle brace.  The veteran stated her ankle pain and impairment is chronic and disrupts her daily life.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating higher than 10 percent for the Veteran's left ankle condition.  The September 2022 VA examiner measured the Veteran's active motion, but also estimated the ankle's motion to be further limited by pain with repeated use. At its most limited, the VA examiner estimated dorsiflexion of 5 degrees and plantar flexion of 15 degrees.  Thus, these measurements did not meet the criteria corresponding to a higher 20 percent rating.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and functional loss, the degree of additional limitation would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion).

The Board has considered whether any other Diagnostic Codes related to disabilities of the ankle would provide for a higher disability rating.  However, the evidence does not reflect that the symptoms would warrant a higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. The Veteran does not have ankylosis of the ankle, subastragalar, or tarsal joint; nor does she have malunion of the calcaneus or talus. See September 2022 C&P Examination. The Veteran has also not had a talectomy. See id.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's appeal for a rating in excess of 10 percent for her left ankle condition.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating higher than 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
