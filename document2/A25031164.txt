ORDER

Entitlement to a rating of 50 percent for migraine headaches, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's headaches manifested as very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability, warranting the maximum schedular disability rating of 50 percent. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for a rating of 50 percent for migraine headaches have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2011 to April 2012.   

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in July 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act.

By way of procedural history, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating in excess of 30 percent, for his migraine headaches in May 2022, which was denied in an August 2022 rating decision. 

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of an increased rating for his migraine headaches, most recently addressed in an August 2022 rating decision.  In July 2023, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 (AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim of an increased rating for migraine headaches, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  

Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found; a practice known as "staged" ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Id. 

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (providing, in pertinent part, that reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant).  When the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, the claim will be granted.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to a rating of 50 percent for migraine headaches, is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a higher rating for his service-connected migraine headaches.   

By way of background, the Veteran was awarded service connection for migraine headaches, with a noncompensable rating, effective September 14, 2017, in a November 2017 rating decision.   The Veteran's disability rating was increased to 30 percent, effective March 15, 2018, in an April 2018 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

In May 2022, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his migraine headaches.  See May 20, 2022 VA 21-526EZ.   The period on appeal is from May 20, 2022, the date the Veteran filed his increased rating claim, plus the one-year "look back" period, taking it to May 20, 2021. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Migraine headaches are rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4.27. Migraine headaches with less frequent attacks than the criteria for a 10 percent rating are rated as noncompensable. Migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months are rated 10 percent disabling. Migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over last several months are rated 30 percent disabling. Migraine headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability are rated 50 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

"'Prostrating' means 'lacking in vitality or will: powerless to rise: laid low.'" Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018) (citing Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 1822 (1966)). The phrase 'characteristic prostrating attacks' plainly describes migraine attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality." Johnson, at 252. Moreover, "[t]he modifier "completely," as used before "prostrating" in the 50 percent criteria, means that the veteran must be rendered entirely powerless and... "productive of severe economic inadaptability" means either producing or capable of producing severe economic inadaptability." Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 67, 70 (2020) citing Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 253 (2018); Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 446 (2004).

Moreover, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) has held that DC 8100 contemplates more than just headache symptoms and requires that VA consider all the symptoms the veteran experiences as a result of migraine attacks, and then rate those symptoms based on the frequency, duration, severity, and economic impact of the attacks. Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 67, 73 (2020). Thus, symptoms other than headaches, such as various non-headache symptoms like dizziness, nausea, vertigo, mood swings, sleep impairment, etc., are adequately contemplated by the migraine headache rating criteria under DC 8100. Id.

The Court has held that the rating criteria under DC 8100 are successive, and therefore require that a veteran rated at a higher level must satisfy all the requirements of the lower levels. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 253-254 (2018). The Court has held that the rating criteria for a 50 percent rating for migraines are conjunctive so this disability must be very frequent, completely prostrating, prolonged, and productive of severe economic inadaptability.  See, for example, Newman v. McDonough, No. 23-2163 (Vet. App. Aug. 29, 2024) (emphasis added). As such, §§ 4.7 and 4.21 do not apply to this regulation. Id. 

After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that a rating of 50 percent, the maximum schedular rating, is warranted. Specifically, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran's symptoms were manifested by frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. 

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran submitted a statement in May 2020 reporting that he experiences headaches four to five times a week, with pain occurring around the temple region behind his ears. The Veteran reported that at least a couple times a month the headaches knock him out of commission to the point that he is totally incapacitated and is unable to do any normal daily activities for four hours. He also reported experiencing light and noise sensitivity. He reported that he is prescribed 800 mg of ibuprofen, in addition to taking Excedrin migraine.  He has missed at least a month of work due to episodes in the last twelve months and has missed events and activities due to his headaches, which render him unable to function at all.  See May 20, 2022 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. 

The Veteran underwent a VA headaches examination in June 2022 where the Veteran reported he currently takes 800 mg of Ibuprofen and 50 mg of Topamax for his migraines.  The examiner noted pulsating or throbbing head pain on both sides of his head, which worsens with physical activity, to include sensitivity to light and sound.  The pain lasts more than two days.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did have characteristic prostrating attacks, once every month, which were not productive of severe economic inadaptability.  The Veteran reported that he is unable to focus and concentrate on complex tasks and has to rest or lie down in a dark room during headache attacks. Lastly, the examiner noted no other pertinent findings. See June 2, 2022 VA examination report. 

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a private statement by C.B., PA-C, contending that the Veteran is entitled to a 50 percent rating for his migraine headaches in accordance with the Diagnostic Code 8100 rating criteria.  

The Veteran underwent a VA headaches examination in February 2023 where the Veteran reported he currently takes 800 mg of Ibuprofen and 50 mg of Topamax for his migraines.  The examiner noted pulsating or throbbing head pain on both sides of his head, which worsens with physical activity, to include sensitivity to light and sound.  The pain lasts more than two days.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did have characteristic prostrating attacks once every month, which were not productive of severe economic inadaptability.  The Veteran reported that he is unable to focus and concentrate on complex tasks and has to rest or lie down in a dark room during headache attacks. Lastly, the examiner noted no other pertinent findings. See February 3, 2023 VA examination report. 

There are no additional medical records of evidence throughout the period on appeal relating to the Veteran's headache symptomatology.  

The Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, such as the frequency and severity of his headaches.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994), see also Petitti v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 415, 528 (2015) (holding that lay persons are competent to describe symptoms capable of lay observation).  The Board has no reason to doubt the veracity of the Veteran's statements as they are consistent with the medical evidence and other evidence of record.  Therefore, the Board finds the Veteran's statements regarding the frequency, severity, and duration of his headaches highly probative.  

After considering the above evidence, the Board finds that it can be reasonably concluded that the Veteran had very frequent migraine headaches that were completely prostrating, where a couple times a month his headaches render him totally incapacitated, unable to do any normal daily activities for four hours.  The Veteran's statements show that his migraine headaches occurred frequently, on average four to five times a week.  The Veteran reported symptoms of pain on both sides of his head, pulsating or throbbing pain, which worsens with physical activity, and sensitivity to light and sound that last more than two days.  The Veteran stated that he takes 800 mg of Ibuprofen and 50 mg tablet of Topamax.  Given the severity and duration of the headaches as described, and after providing the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the evidence shows the Veteran's headaches are very frequent, completely prostrating, and prolonged.  

The Board notes that the 50 percent rating criteria under Diagnostic Code 8100, requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability." Productive can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in Diagnostic Code 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating. Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445-46 (2004).

The Board finds that the evidence shows the Veteran's migraine clearly impacted his ability to work.  The Veteran stated that in the last twelve months, he missed a month of work due to headache episodes. He further stated he is unable to focus and concentrate on complex tasks and has to rest or lie down in a dark room during headache attacks. His headaches have interfered with his activities of daily living and render him unable to function.  Therefore, as the Veteran's headaches cause incapacitation, has affected his ability to concentrate, and has caused him to miss work, the Board finds the Veteran's migraine headaches capable of producing severe economic inadaptability.  See Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 253; see also Pierce, 18 Vet. App. at 445.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds there is at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence with respect to the question of whether the Veteran's migraine headaches are productive of very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic adaptability.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Having resolved reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the functional impairment caused by his service-connected migraine headache disability is most closely reflected by the 50 percent rating for the entire appeal period.  A higher rating is not warranted, as a 50 percent rating is the highest rating available under the rating criteria for a headache condition.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

Neither the Veteran nor her representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the increased rating claim adjudicated herein. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).

Accordingly, entitlement to an initial rating of 50 percent for migraine headaches is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
