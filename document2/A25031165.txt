REASONS FOR REMAND

Because of the limited information currently in the Veteran's claim file, his exact dates of service are not known to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) at this time.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a determination made by a VA Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In a May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board acknowledges that this decision is being issued prior to the expiration of the period during which the Veteran may elect to switch dockets. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). While this time has not expired, the Board finds that there is no prejudice in proceeding with this claim as it is being remanded in full, and to hold this case any longer to seek clarification from the Veteran as to whether he would like to waive the remaining period would ultimately result in prejudice to him.

6. Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of ambulance transportation fees incurred on September 11, 2023, in the amount of $1,340.00

Here, the issue before the Board is whether the Veteran is entitled to payment or reimbursement of medical expenses incurred on September 11, 2023, at a non-VA medical facility. The Veteran reported that he woke up with mucous running down his throat and pressure behind his ears; he was in a confused state, "maybe brain fog." He did not feel well enough to drive to the emergency room, so he called a medical facility and was told the go to the emergency room.  He was told that VA was partners with Adair County Memorial Hospital and that he could use his "Veterans benefits."

An ambulance was called, and the Veteran underwent non-VA emergency room treatment that same day, which was not pre-authorized by VA. See 38 C.F.R. § 17.52(a) (generally indicating that VA must authorize non-VA treatment at private facilities).

The Veteran's VHA file shows that the emergency care would have been approved under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 except that the Veteran submitted his claim after the time limit for filing such had expired.

There are three primary requirements for payment or reimbursement under this statute. The Veteran must be treated in an emergency department or similar facility held out as providing emergency treatment to the public. Also, the treatment received must be for a condition of such a nature that a prudent layperson would have reasonably expected that delay in seeking immediate medical attention would have been hazardous to life or health. Additionally, a VA or federal facility must not be feasibly available to provide the treatment and an attempt to use them beforehand would not have been considered reasonable by a prudent layperson. 38 C.F.R. § 17.1002(a-c).

There are additional criteria that must be met to award payment or reimbursement of the cost of private medical services under 38 U.S.C. § 1725. The Veteran's claim was denied on the basis that the Veteran had other insurance coverage for the dates of service and the claim was untimely filed.

The services were rendered on September 11, 2023, and the evidence reflects the claim was received on December 12, 2023.  A threshold requirement under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 is that the claim for payment or reimbursement be filed within 90 days after the latest of the following:

(1) The date the veteran was discharged from the facility that furnished the emergency treatment;

(2) The date of death, but only if the death occurred during transportation to a facility for emergency treatment or if the death occurred during the stay in the facility that included the provision of the emergency treatment; or

(3) The date the veteran finally exhausted, without success, action to obtain payment or reimbursement for the treatment from a third party. 

38 C.F.R. § 17.1004(d).

Important to this appeal is evidence which suggests the Veteran had Medicare at the time of the episode of care at issue.  There is no indication that the AOJ sought to determine whether the Veteran had exhausted, without success, action to obtain payment or reimbursement for the treatment from a third party 90 days prior to the date the claim was filed. Accordingly, remand is necessary to associate all records pertaining to the (reported) initial claim for reimbursement and all records relating to whether the Veteran had exhausted, without success, action to obtain payment or reimbursement for the treatment from a third party (such as Medicare). See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) ("The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.").

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Ask the Veteran to submit an authorization for VA to secure for the record complete clinical records from the ambulance provider and the non-VA facility for the episode of care on September 11, 2023. If he does so, obtain those records.

2. Associate with the record all evidence considered in connection with the claim on appeal, including (but not limited to):

(a) Evidence regarding the date of receipt of the claim for payment or reimbursement of expenses incurred for transport to a non-VA facility via ambulance on September 11, 2023 (to include a copy of the initial claim for reimbursement); and

(b) Any records relating to whether the Veteran had exhausted, without success, action to obtain payment or reimbursement for the treatment from a third party (such as Medicare).

If the record does not contain any such information, request that information from the Veteran.

3. Then, determine whether the Veteran is entitled to payment or reimbursement of expenses incurred for transport to a non-VA facility via ambulance, as well as for treatment at the non-VA facility, on September 11, 2023, in accordance with the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions, to specifically include 38 U.S.C. § 1725. 

(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)

If the AOJ determines that the claim should instead be adjudicated under 38 U.S.C. § 111, a determination to this effect should be noted in writing and associated with the Veteran's claim file.
