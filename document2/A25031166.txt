ORDER

Entitlement to an initial of 10 percent, but no higher, for service-connected hypertension is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's hypertension has required continuous medication for control but has not manifested in diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure of 200 or more.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for service-connected hypertension have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1978 to August 1984.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2023 higher-level review rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Initial Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where a claimant timely appeals the rating initially assigned for the service-connected disability, VA must consider whether the claimant is entitled to "staged" ratings to compensate them for times since filing the claim when their disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the appeal.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  In view of the number of atypical instances, it is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.  It is the defined and consistently applied policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent with the facts shown in every case. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

Entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for service-connected hypertension is granted.

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for hypertension.  Importantly, as this is an appeal as to the initial rating assigned, the relevant temporal focus is from February 22, 2017, the effective date of the award of service connection.

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a noncompensable rating for hypertension under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101.  Pursuant to DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is assigned for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension) when diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure is predominantly 160 or more; or, as a minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure that is predominantly 110 or more, or; systolic pressure that is predominantly 200 or more.  A 40 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure that is predominantly 120 or more.  A 60 percent rating is assigned where diastolic pressure is predominantly 130 or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101.  The Board notes that DC 7101 does not provide for a 0 percent rating, however, in every instance where the Rating Schedule does not provide a zero percent rating for a particular diagnostic code, such a rating shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

There are three notes to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.  Note (1) provides that hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days.  For purposes of this section, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure (i.e., bottom number) is predominantly 90 mm or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means the systolic blood pressure (i.e., top number) is predominantly 160 mm or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm.  Note (2) requires the evaluation of hypertension due to aortic insufficiency or hyperthyroidism, which is usually the isolated systolic type, as part of the condition causing it rather than by a separate evaluation.  Note (3) states that hypertension should be evaluated separately from hypertensive heart disease and other types of heart disease.

The Board emphasizes that more than one blood pressure reading is not required for evaluation purposes for rating hypertension under VA regulations.  See Gill v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 386, 391 (2013) (holding that the need for a specific number of blood pressure readings over multiple days is not required for determining disability evaluation, as the need for multiple blood pressure readings pertains only to the confirmation of the existence of hypertension).

The Board acknowledges the Court's holding that VA may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).  However, the Court subsequently determined that for hypertension, the plain language of Diagnostic Code 7101 contemplates the effects of medication and, thus, the Jones case is not applicable to cases involving hypertension.  See McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271-73 (2016).  That is, the rating criteria for hypertension already takes into account the ameliorative effects of medication.  Id.

Here, the evidence reveals that throughout the period on appeal the Veteran has been taking medication to control his blood pressure.  See August 2022 Hypertension Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).  A treatment note from prior to the Veteran's prescription for medication shows a blood pressure reading of 142/110.  See April 1984 Emergency Treatment Note.

After beginning treatment with medication, the Veteran's systolic readings have consistently been under 160 and his diastolic readings have consistently been under 100.  In April 2018, the Veteran's blood pressure was recorded as 112/68.  See October 2018 Veteran Submitted Hypertension DBQ.  In July 2018, the Veteran's blood pressure was recorded as 120/72.  Id.  In November 2018, his blood pressure was recorded as 146/81.  See November 2018 Urgent Care Note.  In April 2019, his blood pressure was recorded as 132/79.  See April 2019 Otolaryngology Note.  In December 2020, three readings were taken and documented as 137/60, 130/64, and 133/78.  See December 2020 Primary Care Nursing Note.  In August 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his hypertension and his blood pressure was recorded as 140/70 and 145/68.  See August 2022 Hypertension DBQ.  

Upon consideration of the foregoing evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's hypertension most closely approximates the criteria for a 10 percent rating.  Significantly, the Veteran's diastolic readings prior to going on continuous medication were predominantly 100 or higher.  Given such, historically the Veteran's diastolic reading was predominantly 100 and he requires continuous medication for control.  However, an evaluation in excess of 10 percent is not warranted as there is no evidence that the Veteran's diastolic readings have exceeded 110 or that his systolic readings have exceeded 200 at any point during the period on appeal. 

Accordingly, entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for service-connected hypertension is granted.
