DOCKET NO. 240628-452299
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issues of a rating in excess of 20 percent for a left ankle disability, and in excess of 20 percent for a right ankle disability, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On October 16, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

In the present case, the appellant has withdrawn this appeal. In correspondence received from the appellant on October 16, 2024, the appellant stated, "I currently have (3) three disability claim appeals pending awaiting to be assigned dates to be heard. I am requesting that those claims for appeal be discontinued. I no longer desire for those claims to move forward. Date of filing are as follows: November 16, 2023; June 14, 2024; and June 28, 2024. Please disregard and cancel these claims for appeal as I no longer desire to pursue them."

The Board notes the instant appeal was filed June 28, 2024.  The Veteran submitted a clear and unambiguous withdrawal request for the entirety of the claim that includes his name and file number.   Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  The other appeals have been addressed in separate decisions. 

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review this appeal, and it is dismissed.
