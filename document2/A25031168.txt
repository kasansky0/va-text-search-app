DOCKET NO. 230429-342722
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal with respect to entitlement to Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) services under Chapter 31, Title 38, United States Code, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In December 2023, while the current appeal was pending, the Veteran was awarded VR&E independent living services. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There remains no case or controversy with respect to the Veteran's entitlement to VR&E services over which the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may exercise jurisdiction.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.103, 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1981 to October 1983.  His decorations include the Army Service Ribbon.

This matter comes to the Board on appeal from an April 2023 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Indianapolis, Indiana.  The Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) later that month, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after that decision was promulgated.

Dismissal

The Board's jurisdiction is limited to review of questions in a matter which is subject to decision by the Secretary under 38 U.S.C. § 511(a).  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  One of the principal functions of the Board is to make determinations of appellate jurisdiction.  38 C.F.R. § 20.103.  The Board may address questions pertaining to its jurisdictional authority to review a particular case.  38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c).

In the present case, the record shows that the Veteran applied for VR&E benefits in March 2023.  In his VA Form 28-1902w (Rehabilitation Needs Inventory (RNI)), he indicated that he was seeking VR&E assistance to "[e]nhance [his] chance for a better life."  He was evaluated by a vocational rehabilitation counselor in March 2023 and determined to have a serious employment handicap.  See March 2023 VA Form 28-1902b (Counseling Record-Narrative Report); March 2023 VR-58 (Chapter 31 Positive Decision Letter).  In an April 2023 decision, however, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to VR&E services, finding that employment was not reasonably feasible and that he had no identified independent living needs.  See April 2023 VR-58 (Decision Letter).  Following that determination, he initiated the present appeal.

Thereafter, while the current appeal was pending, the Veteran reapplied for VR&E benefits in July 2023 and August 2023.  In December 2023, the AOJ approved the Veteran's request for independent living services and an Individualized Independent Living Plan was signed with a program goal of maximizing independence of daily living.  See December 2023 VR-64 (Chapter 31 Positive Decision Letter at Plan Development).

It is well-established that when there is no case or controversy, or when a once-live case or controversy becomes moot, an appellate body lacks jurisdiction.  As illustrated above, the issue on appeal has been rendered moot by virtue of the fact that the AOJ has granted the Veteran's request for independent living services, and he is currently participating in a VR&E program.  As the benefit sought on appeal has been allowed, the Board must find that there remains no outstanding allegation of error of fact or law for the Board to address with respect to this matter.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; Smith v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 330, 333-34 (1997) (dismissal is the proper remedy to employ when an appeal has become moot).  The appeal must therefore be dismissed.
