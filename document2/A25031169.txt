ORDER

The reduction in the disability rating for headaches from 50 percent to 30 percent effective May 1, 2023, was not proper; restoration of a 50 percent evaluation for headaches is granted effective May 1, 2023. 

FINDING OF FACT

The reduction in the disability rating from 50 percent to 30 percent for headache was not based on improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The reduction in the disability rating for headache from 50 percent to 30 percent was not proper. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105 (e), 3.344.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2008 to September 2018 and from December 2018 to September 2019, with additional service as a member of the National Guard and the Reserve. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO)'s rating decision issued in February 2023. 

In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The reduction in the disability rating for headaches from 50 percent to 30 percent effective May 1, 2023, was not proper; restoration of a 50 percent evaluation for headaches is granted effective May 1, 2023. 

The Veteran contends that her headache should continue to be rated as 50 percent disabling because she is still being treated for the disability at VA. See September 2022 VA Form 21-4138; she reports that her headaches occur on a daily basis and leave her unable to do anything on average ten to fifteen times a month. Id. 

Where a reduction in evaluation of a service-connected disability is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made, a rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. The beneficiary will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor. Additionally, the beneficiary must be given notice that he has 60 days to present additional evidence to show that compensation payments should be continued at the present level. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received within that period, final rating action will be taken and the award will be reduced or discontinued effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e). 

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a), (b) prescribe additional requirements for rating reductions but only apply to ratings that have continued for long periods at the same level (5 years or more). They do not apply to disabilities which have not become stabilized and are likely to improve. Reexaminations disclosing improvement, physical or mental, in these disabilities will warrant reduction in rating. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c).

At the time of the February 2023 reduction, the 50 percent rating for the Veteran's headache had been in effect since September 2019. Thus, as the rating for headache had been in effect for less than five years, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a), (b), which provide additional regulatory hurdles to rating reductions, do not apply.

Nevertheless, the Court has stated that certain regulations "impose a clear requirement that VA rating reductions, as with all VA rating decisions, be based upon review of the entire history of the veteran's disability." Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420 (1993) (referring to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.13). With respect to ratings that have been in effect for less than 5 years, as in this case, 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c) requires improvement before a rating is reduced. Implicit in the regulations is that any improvement must be of such a nature as to warrant a change in the rating. In Brown, the Court articulated three questions that must be addressed in determining whether a rating reduction is warranted by the evidence. First, a rating reduction case requires ascertaining "whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability." Second, it must be determined whether the examination reports reflecting such change were based upon thorough examinations. Third, it must be determined whether the improvement actually reflects an improvement in a veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 421.

The circumstances under which a disability rating may be reduced are specifically limited and carefully circumscribed by regulations promulgated by VA. See Dofflemeyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 280 (1992). The burden of proof is on VA to establish that a reduction is warranted by a preponderance of the evidence. The Court has stated that both decisions by the RO and by the Board that do not apply the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344, when applicable, are void ab initio and will be set aside as not in accordance with the law. Kitchens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 320 (1995); Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 413; see also Hayes v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 67, 73 (1996). Where a rating reduction was made without observance of law, the reduction must be vacated and the prior rating restored. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

A review of the evidence of record indicates that the assignment of the 50 percent rating was based on a September 2020 VA examination, which reflects a diagnosis of headache. At the examination, the Veteran reported that her headache had begun in 2012 with photosensitivity requiring self-isolation in a dark room and she had difficulty concentrating, which was not relieved by NSAIDs. She rated bilateral temple pain at 10 out of 10 in intensity lasting for 1 to 3 days. At the time of the examination, the Veteran reported she had continued to get headaches, with increasing frequency of 4 episodes of headache in a month. She still reported having photosensitivity and phonosensitivity with bilateral temple pain, which was unrelieved by Advil. She stated that she would need to lay down and self-isolate. The episode would last for 1 to 3 days. The treatment consisted of taking Advil or Tylenol. The symptoms included constant head pain, pulsating or throbbing head pain, pain on both sides of the head, and pain worsening with physical activity. The duration of typical head pain was more than 2 days, and the location of typical head pain was both sides of the head. The Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine or non-migraine headache pain. The examiner reported that 2 to 4 weeks of work time were lost in the last 12 months due to the headache and documented the Veteran's report that she would at times have to leave work early or call in to work due to headache pain, photosensitivity, and phonosensitivity unrelieved by Advil. 

In an October 2020 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for headaches, with an evaluation of 50 percent, effective March 2, 2020. The AOJ assigned a 50 percent evaluation based on a finding that very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability, with additional symptoms of characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over last several months. 

In an April 2022 rating decision, the AOJ proposed to reduce the evaluation of headache from 50 percent to 30 percent. The AOJ stated that the October 2020 rating decision "erroneously granted an evaluation of 50 percent disabling, when the VA [examination] dated September 18, 2020, clearly shows that only a 30 percent evaluation was warranted. The AOJ included the due process rights for rate reduction in the rating decision, but such information was not included in an April 2022 notification letter. 

In a September 2022 VA Form 21-4138, the Veteran stated that her headache should continue to be rated as 50 percent disabling because she is still being treated for the disability at VA. Moreover, she reported that her headaches occurred on a daily basis and left her unable to do anything on average ten to fifteen times a month

An October 2022 VA examination, which reflects a diagnosis of migraine including migraine variants, with a diagnosis date of March 2021. The examiner provided a summary of the history of the Veteran's headaches since 2010 when she had the first episode of "terrible headaches." The examiner noted that the had history of status migrainosus in the past that required hospitalization for days, but no recurrence since. The examiner stated that currently she had occasional tension type headaches. The examiner noted the Veteran's September 2022 statement. The treatment consisted of taking ibuprofen 800 mg. The symptoms included pulsating or throbbing head pain nad pain on both sides of the head, with sensitivity to light and sound. Typical head pain lasted more than 2 days, and it was located on both sides of the head. The Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine or non-migraine headache pain with less frequent attacks. Functional impact due to headaches on her ability to work is difficulty concentrating during episodes of headache. 

A November 2022 notification letter, with explanation for the due process rights, was issued to replace the April 2022 letter. 

In the February 2023 rating decision, the AOJ effectuated the evaluation of 30 percent, effective May 1, 2023. The AOJ explained that the October 2022 VA examination showed improvement of the condition. 

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that the rate reduction was improper for the following reasons. 

First, the evidence of record does not reflect an actual change in the disability. Objective symptoms, in severity, frequency, and duration, have remained relatively stable with the same level of functional impairment. The Veteran's report of symptomatology and functional impact also remained the same since the initial examination. The disability pictures described by the October 2022 VA examination do not differ substantively from what was provided in the September 2020 VA examination. A review of the VA treatment records does not provide any worsening or improving conditions of her headaches. 

Second, the Board finds that both September 2020 and October 2022 VA examinations provide sufficient information for rating purpose, with no evidence of lacking in thoroughness. 

Third, no evidence of record indicates that there has been an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work in terms of her headaches. She has consistently reported that she needs to lie down or isolate herself in a dark room due to sensitivity to light and sound and also has difficulty concentrating during an episode of headache. 

Lastly, the Board acknowledges that in the April 2022 rating decision, the AOJ initially attempted to apply 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a) for clear and unmistakable error, the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. The AOJ did not explain how this provision was applicable to the Veteran's case; instead, it conclusory stated that the September 2020 VA examination clearly shows that only a 30 percent evaluation. The AOJ failed to provide rationale for why this error was CUE. Then, in the February 2023 rating decision, the AOJ made a decision to reduce rating based on improvement in the disability. Therefore, the Board finds that the AOJ's decision to reduce the rating was not based on CUE and an argument concerning CUE is not considered. 

For the foregoing reasons, the rate reduction effectuated in the February 2023 rating decision does not meet the requirement set forth under 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 and associated caselaw. Accordingly, the 50 percent rating for the Veteran's headache will be restored effective May 1, 2023, the date of the reduction.
