DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Readjudication of the claim of entitlement to Chapter 35 Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

New and relevant evidence has not been added to the appellant's claim file as she has not presented evidence that tends to prove or disprove that the Veteran is either deceased or has been found to be permanently and totally disabled due to a service-connected disability.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for readjudication of the claim of entitlement to Chapter 35 DEA benefits have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. §§ 2.500, 2.501, 3.807.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1991 to November 1999.  

The appellant is his adult daughter, who is seeking Chapter 35 DEA benefits based on the Veteran's service.

The administrative decision on appeal was issued in March 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In March 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  Therefore, the Board must determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based only on the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal.  

In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  The AMA Direct Review does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  As this is a Direct Review appeal under the AMA, the record closed as of the March 2023 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the March 2023 AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to Chapter 35 DEA benefits.

The appellant contends that she is eligible for Chapter 35 DEA benefits as she initially applied for education benefits in 2005 when she was 25 years old.  See VA Form 10182, April 2023.  

In the March 2023 administrative decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that the appellant had not submitted new and relevant evidence to reconsider her claim for entitlement to Chapter 35 DEA benefits.  The AOJ further stated that the appellant was previously informed in an April 30, 2014, decision that she was ineligible for VA education benefits.  

A legacy decision, a decision rendered prior to February 19, 2019, becomes final and is not subject to revision on the same factual basis unless a notice of disagreement is filed within one year of the notice of the decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103.  If a claim has been previously denied and that decision became final, the claim can be readjudicated only if new and relevant evidence is presented and secured.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).  Relevant evidence is evidence that tends to provide or disprove a matter in issue.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).  

Here, an April 2014 legacy decision denied the appellant's claim of entitlement to Chapter 35 DEA benefits.  She did not appeal this determination, and no new or relevant evidence was submitted within a year following notification of the April 2014 denial.  The April 2014 legacy decision is therefore final.

The prior final decision denying entitlement to Chapter 35 DEA benefits was based on a finding that the Veteran was not in receipt of a permanent and total (100%) service-connected disability at the time of the March 2014 application for Chapter 35 DEA benefits.   

The questions in this case are whether the appellant submitted evidence after the prior final denial of her claim of entitlement to Chapter 35 DEA benefits and/or when submitting her new claim in March 2023, and if so, whether that evidence is new and relevant to her claim.  

Basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits for the child or surviving spouse of a veteran may be established if: (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

The Board finds that the appellant has not submitted new evidence after the prior final rating decision that is relevant to her claim as she has not presented any evidence indicating that the Veteran is deceased and/or was ever in receipt of a permanent and total service-connected disability.  A recent January 2025 Rating Decision - Codesheet indicates that the Veteran is currently in receipt of an 80 percent disability rating effective July 11, 2024; however, 80 percent is not equivalent to a permanent and total disability rating.  Accordingly, readjudication of the claim of entitlement to Chapter 35 DEA benefits is not warranted.  

The Board acknowledges the appellant's claim that she initially applied for Chapter 35 DEA benefits when she was 25; however, the evidence indicates that the basic eligibility requirement for Chapter 35 DEA benefits have never been met.  Therefore, the timing of the appellant's application for Chapter 35 DEA benefits is not relevant as the Veteran has not established basic eligibility requirements for entitlement to Chapter 35 DEA benefits.   

Although the Board is sympathetic to the appellant's position and understands her desire to pursue educational opportunities, the legal criteria governing eligibility for the receipt of Chapter 35 DEA benefits are clear and specific.  As detailed above, for the appellant to be entitled to the benefits she seeks, the Veteran would have to be in receipt of a permanent and total rating due to service-connected disability, which he is not.  The Board is bound by those criteria.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104; Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425 (1994).  

For these reasons, the Board must find that the appellant has no legal entitlement to Chapter 35 DEA benefits.  The appeal is denied.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994) (when the law and not the evidence is dispositive, a claim for entitlement to VA benefits should be denied or the appeal to the Board terminated because of the absence of legal merit or the lack of entitlement under the law).
