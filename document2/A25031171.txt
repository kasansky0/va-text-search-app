ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Reviewing the evidence in light most favorable to the Veteran and affording him the benefit of the doubt, he has experienced pain related to his back disability since its onset in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1969 to August 1972.

In October 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for a back disability most recently addressed in a March 2024 rating decision. In February 2025, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2025 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine

The Veteran contends that service connection for a back disability is warranted.

Establishing service connection generally requires medical evidence or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of the following: (1) A current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) nexus between the claimed in-service disease and the present disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of symptomatology. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (noting that a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).

In this case, the AOJ found that the Veteran has a current back disability. The Board is bound by this favorable finding.

The Veteran has current diagnoses of degenerative arthritis, lumbosacral strain, multifactorial neural foraminal stenosis, herniated disc, and spinal stenosis. Degenerative arthritis is an enumerated condition under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) and constitutes chronic disease that can be presumptively service connected based on continuity of symptomatology.

Reviewing the evidence in light most favorable to the Veteran and affording him the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that his back pain had its onset in service and continued after his separation from service.

To that end, the Veteran reported experiencing back pain during pilot training when he jumped from an airplane. He stated that the pain has become progressively worse over time. The Veteran's wife stated that this injury has caused him back pain ever since service. These statements are corroborated by the Veteran's service treatment records showing treatment for back pain multiple times in service.

The record contains a negative nexus opinion, but it is not supported by an adequate rationale because the examiner fails to address the competent lay statements of continuity of symptoms. 

The Veteran and his spouse are competent to report lay observable symptoms, such as pain. The Board finds no reason to reject the competence or credibility of his testimony. His spouse's competent and credible lay evidence is given significant probative weight, as she has known him and witnessed his symptoms since they were married in 1969.

Reviewing this evidence in light most favorable to the Veteran and affording him the benefit of the doubt, the Board concludes that continuity of symptomatology is established. Therefore, service connection for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine is granted.
