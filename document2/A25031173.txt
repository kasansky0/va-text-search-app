ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claim was originally denied in a February 2023 rating decision.

2. The VA Form 10182 received in July 2024, identified disagreement specifically with the February 2023 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection with sleep apnea; no good cause was provided for the untimely appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from May 1985 to January 1990. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) stemming from an attempted appeal of a February 2023 rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Generally, the direct review docket lane triggers an appeal by the Board limited to the evidentiary record that was before the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of the appealed decision (in this case, February 2023).  38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Here, however, as will be discussed below, the July 2024 VA Form 10182 was an untimely appeal and no good cause to accept the filing late has ever been provided. Accordingly, the matter must be dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia, is dismissed.

By way of background, the Veteran initially filed a claim seeking entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea in October 2022. His claim was denied in a February 2023 rating decision. 

The Veteran timely filed a HLR request in March 2023 and requested a HLR conference which was held in June 2023. Also in June 2023, the RO issued a rating decision identifying a duty to assist error had occurred in the development of the Veteran's original claim for service connection for sleep apnea. The RO obtained additional VA medical opinions in August 2023, to specifically include a Toxic Risk Exposure Activity (TERA) opinion, as well as another secondary nexus opinion. Ultimately, the RO continued the denial of the Veteran's sleep apnea claim in a November 2023 HLR rating decision. 

The Veteran than filed a VA form 10182 in July 2024 and elected the Direct docket, specifically appealing the February 2023 rating decision that originally denied service-connected for sleep apnea. 

The July 2024 filing, on its face untimely, was not presented with any good cause as to why it should be accepted as timely. 

The Board considered whether the Veteran's July 10182 could be construed as a timely appeal as to the later in time November 2023 rating decision but finds it cannot. 

Although the Board recognizes its general obligation to read the Veteran's submissions in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal, the NOD must nonetheless identify the specific decision and issue/issues therein with which the claimant disagrees. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.2020(a). 

Here, the VA Form 10182 was clear and unambiguous on its face as to which specific decision the Veteran disagreed (the February 2023 rating decision) and as to which issue the Veteran disagreed (the sleep apnea denial). 

Under the AMA regulations, if the VA Form 10182 is clear and unambiguous on its face, then there is nothing to liberally construe. See for comparison Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023) (consideration must be given to the "full context within which [veterans'] submissions are made" including liberally construing the filings of pro se claimants. ((citing Rivera v. Shinseki, 654 F.3d 1377, 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011)). In this case, the Veteran has been represented throughout, and more importantly it is clear and unambiguous that the Veteran chose to appeal the earlier in time February 1, 2023, rating decision as the claims file contains no other indication that this was not the Veteran's true intention, and, he has filed other VA Forms indicating he understands and knows the difference between the forms used in the AMA. See e.g., March 2023 HLR Request.

Furthermore, under Terry the Court has held that a veteran has the right to pick an earlier in time rating decision if he so chooses, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run. Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). 

In this case, the Veteran has been represented throughout, and more importantly it is clear and unambiguous that the Veteran chose to appeal the earlier in time February 1, 2023, rating decision as the claims file contains no other indication that this was not the Veteran's true intention, and, he has filed other VA Forms indicating he understands and knows the difference between the forms used in the AMA. See, e.g., March 2023 HLR Request.

As such, the Board finds the July 2024 VA Form 10182 was untimely, and the docketing of the appeal was in error. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a).

Nevertheless, the Board confirmed receipt of the VA Form 10182 in a July 2024 letter and placed the Veteran's appeal on the docket. The Board, therefore, also considered whether this ministerial action (or any other action of the agency) could be perceived as an implicit waiver of the Veteran's untimely appeal. See generally, Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (en banc); see also Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 332 (2022) (regulatory claims-processing rules may be waived without affecting jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal); Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 45 (2009) (VA may implicitly or explicitly waive any issue of timeliness in the filing of a Substantive Appeal). The Board still retains subject-matter jurisdiction over claims on appeal when claims-processing rules are not followed; it is the Board's duty to engage in factfinding and explain the basis for any waiver or forfeiture of the relevant claims-processing rules. Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 333.

The Board finds no such implicit or explicit waiver of procedural defect was made nor is a waiver warranted. 

In particular, the Board considered whether it waived its right to enforce the prohibition on untimely appeals by virtue of docketing the appeal. See, e.g., Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46-47 (holding VA waived any objection to the timeliness of the legacy substantive appeal because "VA consistently treated th[e] matter as if it was part of the timely filed Substantive Appeal []" for over five years.").

The Board finds that assigning the appeal a docket in and of itself does not constitute a waiver of the prohibition of concurrent election. Indeed, whether the Board has waived any objection to timeliness of an appeal should be based on all facts and circumstances of that case. Accord Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46 (discussing VA's actions in that case in finding VA had treated the substantive appeal as timely filed).

Here, although the Board completed the ministerial action of docketing the appeal, unlike the circumstances of Percy, the Board did not continuously "engage in substantive and procedural development" of the appeal. As noted above, the Veteran initially chose to pursue his appeal by electing HLR. Upon completion of additional develop deemed necessary by the RO, it issued another rating decision in November 2023 continuing the denial of the Veteran's claim. The Veteran than clearly and unambiguously chose to appeal the February 2023 rating decision which originally denied entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. In filing this VA Form 10182, the Veteran nor his representative, has ever explained or provided good cause as to why VA should accept this untimely filing. In addition, the July 2024 docketing letter which confirmed initial acceptance of the July 2024 VA Form 10182, warned the Veteran and his representative that placement of the Veteran's appeal on the docket does not waive any procedural requirements, to specifically include the necessity of filing a timely VA Form 10182, and the Board could ultimately dismiss his appeal for violation of said requirements. There were no further communications, and no action was taken in which the Veteran would be under the impression that the merits of the case were examined and being developed in any substantive way. Rather, the Veteran's service connection claim for sleep apnea remained pending without further development. Accordingly, the Board finds that there has been no waiver of the timeliness under the facts and circumstances of this case.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds the attempted appeal must be dismissed as the July 2024 VA Form 10182 was untimely and no waiver (implicit or explicit) was made. The Board reiterates its finding that the docketing of the instant appeal was in error.

The appeal is dismissed.
