ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 13, 2023, for the award of a 100 percent rating for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with alcohol and cannabis dependence is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 13, 2023, for the award of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) based on permanent and total disability status is denied.

The reduction of the rating for eczema to include tinea corporis/cruris/pedis, from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective October 13, 2023, was improper; reinstatement of the 10 percent rating is therefore awarded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran did not continuously pursue his PTSD increased rating, as his submission of an October 13, 2023, fully developed claim on VA Form 21-526EZ is not one of the three enumerated administrative review options detailed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

2. It was not factually ascertainable that the Veteran's PTSD resulted in total occupational and social impairment during the period from October 13, 2022, to October 12, 2023, as there is no evidence to suggest that he exhibited many of the criteria that encompass the 100 percent rating let alone the 70 percent rating, to include suicidal or homicidal ideation, hallucinations, neglect of personal appearance, gross impairment in thought processes or communication, or severe memory loss.

3. Prior to October 13, 2023, the Veteran did not have a permanent and total service-connected disability.

4. The March 2024 VA examination used to justify the rating reduction of the Veteran's eczema to include tinea corporis/cruris/pedis from 10 percent to 0 percent was inadequate.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to October 13, 2023, for the award of a 100 percent rating for PTSD with alcohol and cannabis dependence, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to October 13, 2023, for the award of basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

3. The criteria for the reinstatement of the 10 percent rating for eczema to include tinea corporis/cruris/pedis, effective October 13, 2023, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105 (e), 3.344, 4.2, 4.10, 4.71a. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the Army from August 1964 to August 1967, to include service in the Republic of Vietnam.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Hearing option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).

In February 2025, the Veteran testified at a Board hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge. The transcript is of record. The Veteran waived the 90 day period to submit additional evidence. See February 2025 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

The Board notes the Veteran identified October 23, 2023, as the date of the rating decision he wished to appeal. The Board reflects there is no rating decision, notice letter, or any other adjudicatory document with that date. However, the Veteran specified that the issue he wished the Board to review was "effective date, October 23, 2023" and "tinnitus not being granted." The Board notes that tinnitus is already service connected. In addition, the Veteran testified at a Board hearing in which the Veteran clarified the issues being appealed. Therefore, the Board has liberally construed the Veteran's VA Form 10182 as an appeal of the April 2024 rating decision with regards to the issues of entitlement to an earlier effective date for a 100 percent disability rating for PTSD, whether the reduction of the Veteran's eczema was proper and entitlement an earlier effective date for DEA. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 13, 2023, for the grant of a 100 percent rating for PTSD with alcohol and cannabis dependence is denied.

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to October 13, 2023, for the grant of a 100 percent rating for PTSD. The Veteran's effective date is currently the date VA received the Veteran's October 2023 VA Form 20-526EZ Application for Disability Compensation, seeking an increased disability rating for his PTSD. Unfortunately, the evidence does not warrant an earlier effective date.

The effective date for an increased rating for disability compensation will be the latest of 1) the date entitlement arose, 2) the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred if a claim is received within one year from such date, or 3) the date of receipt of the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o). This general rule applies equally under the legacy and AMA systems of review. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h)(1).

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), a claim can be continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c)(h). In 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p), the AMA categorizes claims as either "supplemental" or "initial." The type of claim adjudicated can directly impact the effective date assigned for a granted benefit. An "initial" claim cannot establish continuous pursuit, regardless of whether it was received within one year of the issuance of the prior VA decision.

In this case, the Veteran filed a new claim for an increased rating for PTSD. The October 13, 2023, filing was on the prescribed form for an "initial" claim for a higher rating for his PTSD (VA Form 21-526EZ). Unlike a supplemental claim or a higher-level review request, an "initial" claim is not a request for review of the prior decision, but, rather, a claim for an increased rating based on a change or worsening since the last decision. Therefore, the October 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ constitutes an "initial" claim for a higher rating and disrupts the chain of continuous pursuit.

Nevertheless, the Board must also acknowledge that for claims seeking an increase in a service-connected disability, if an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." Therefore, the relevant period on appeal extends up to one year prior to the date of the submission of the fully developed claim, that is, October 13, 2022. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (1998). As such, the Board must now consider the earliest date on which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in the Veteran's PTSD symptomatology occurred, to include consideration within one year prior to the October 2023 claim for an increase.

The Veteran's PTSD is currently rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411. 

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages.  Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

A 50 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.

As such, the Board will consider both the Veteran's specific symptomatology as well as the occupational and social impairment associated with the diagnostic code to determine whether the Veteran satisfied the criteria for an increased, 100 percent evaluation in the year prior to the October 2023 increased rating claim.

Turning to the evidence of record, in a January 2023 VA treatment note, the Veteran was noted to be social, irritable, but appeared motivated. The Veteran indicated no current crises. The Veteran expressed using alcohol and marijuana to manage his depression. The examiner noted that the Veteran specifically denied suicidal/homicidal thoughts, plan or intent.

In an April 2023 VA treatment note, the Veteran was alert/aware and orientated. He was dressed/groomed appropriately, His insight/judgment was within normal limit. The examiner noted that the Veteran specifically denied suicidal/homicidal thoughts, plan or intent.

In a May 2023 VA treatment note, the Veteran was alert/aware, and oriented. The Veteran was dressed/groomed appropriately. No new risk factors relevant to suicide or homicide was reported. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not appear to be at imminent risk of harm to self or others at this time.

In an August 2023 VA treatment note, the Veteran reports worsening memory loss/forgetfulness and irritability/depression. The Veteran noted that his PTSD symptoms including nightmares and flashbacks have remained uncontrolled. The Veteran reported intrusive thoughts that occur nearly every day. The Veteran endorsed hypervigilance, irritability, and exaggerated startle response. The Veteran was noted to be appropriately dressed, cleanly groomed. The Veteran denied hallucinations. No delusions or paranoia noted during the interview. The Veteran denied suicidal and homicidal ideation. 

Unfortunately, after review of the Veteran's treatment records in the year prior to the October 13, 2023, claim, it is not factually ascertainable that an increase in the disability occurred. 38 C.F.R. §3.400 (o)(2)); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

After review, the Board finds that Veteran's PTSD was manifested by symptoms associated with a 50 percent rating. There is no evidence to support that the Veteran has exhibited many of the criteria that encompass the 100 percent rating, let alone the 70 percent rating, to include suicidal or homicidal ideation, hallucinations, neglect of personal appearance, gross impairment in thought processes or communication, or severe memory loss.

The Veteran also had symptoms that are not listed with a specific rating, such as exaggerated startle response. The Board finds the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's unlisted symptoms more closely approximate the symptoms contemplated by a 50 percent rating, which are less severe, less frequent, and shorter in duration than those contemplated by a 70 or 100 percent rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126.  

The Board also finds the level of impairment caused by the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximates the level associated with a 50 percent rating.  The Veteran experienced occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. 

As such, an effective date earlier than October 13, 2023, for the increased 100 percent disability rating for PTSD is not warranted. As demonstrated above, there is no evidence that in the year prior to the October 13, 2023, initial claim that it was first factually ascertainable that the Veteran's disability picture more nearly approximated the level of severity contemplated by a 70 or 100 percent disability rating. As the evidence weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application and the Veteran's claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 13, 2023, for the grant of basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than October 13, 2023, for the award of basic eligibility to DEA benefits. For the following reasons, the Board finds an earlier effective date is not warranted.

Basic eligibility for DEA benefits arises if a veteran is discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and has a permanent total service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

In this case, the Veteran has been awarded a 100 percent disability rating for PTSD effective October 13, 2023 (as noted above, the Board has denied entitlement to an earlier effective date for that award). 

Because the Veteran has not been awarded a permanent and total service-connected disability prior to October 13, 2023, the legal criteria for entitlement to DEA benefits have not been met. The claim for an earlier effective date must be denied.

3. The reduction of the rating for eczema to include tinea corporis/cruris/pedis, from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective October 13, 2023, was improper; reinstatement of the 10 percent rating is therefore granted.

The Board has considered whether the procedural provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 5112 (b)(6) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) apply to the instant case, which generally provide that no rating shall be reduced without first providing a period of 60 days to submit evidence or argument, and without providing a period of 30 days to request a pre-determination hearing. In Stelzel v. Mansfield, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that these procedural provisions do not apply to cases in which a rating reduction does not result in a decrease in overall compensation. See Stelzel v. Mansfield, 508 F.3d 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also O'Connell v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 89 (2007), footnote 3; VAOPGCPREC 71-91. Under VA's Schedule of Rating Disabilities, a reduction in rating for a single disability does not always result in a reduction in overall compensation payments. See VAOPGCPREC 71-91.

In the instant case, despite the reduction in rating for the Veteran's eczema to include tinea corporis/cruris/pedis from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective October 13, 2023, there was no reduction in compensation payments. Therefore, the procedural provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 5112 (b)(6) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) are not applicable in this case.

The veteran's disability rating shall not be reduced unless an improvement in the disability is shown to have occurred. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155. Prior to reducing a veteran's disability rating, VA is required to comply with several general VA regulations applicable to all rating-reduction cases, regardless of the rating level or the length of time that the rating has been in effect. It is essential, both in the examination and in the evaluation of the disability, that each disability be viewed in relation to its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. If an examination report does not contain sufficient detail, or the diagnosis is not supported by the findings on the examination report, it cannot be used as a basis for reduction. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. When any change in evaluation is to be made, the rating agency should assure itself that there has been an actual change in the condition, for better or worse, and not merely a difference in thoroughness of the examinations or in use of descriptive terms. 38 C.F.R. § 4.13. Finally, it must be considered that the basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body, to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

Pursuant to these provisions, VA is required in any rating-reduction case to ascertain, based upon review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability and whether the examination reports reflecting such change are based upon thorough examinations. Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420-21 (1993). Thus, not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred, but also that such improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. See Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 350 (2000). The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has consistently held that when a disability rating is reduced without following the applicable regulations, the reduction is void ab initio. See Greyzck v. West, 12 Vet. App. 288, 292 (1999).

In determining whether a reduction was proper, the Board must focus upon evidence available to the RO at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered in the context of evaluating whether the condition has actually improved. See Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 281-82 (1992). However, post-reduction evidence may not be used to justify an improper reduction.

After review of the record, the Board finds that restoration of the Veteran's 10 percent rating for his eczema to include tinea corporis/cruris/pedis is warranted. Specifically, the Board finds the March 2024 examination, which was used to support the reduction, was inadequate because it does not provide sufficient detail for the Board to make a fully informed evaluation. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).

At the March 2024 VA examination, the examiner found that the Veteran's eczema affected less than 5 percent of his body, and found that the dermatophytosis separately affected less than 5 percent of the Veteran's body. However, the examiner also stated that the diagnosis of eczema to include tinea corporis/cruris/pedis is changed and it is a progression of the previous diagnosis. The examiner noted that the flares to the groin region are worse. Hence, the VA examination is inadequate for rating purposes given these inconsistencies.

?

Moreover and, at a minimum, the Board cannot say that the results of the March 2024 examination reflect actual improvement under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

When a reduction of disability is based on an inadequate examination, the reduction is void ab initio. See Greyzck, 12 Vet. App. at 292. Accordingly, as the rating reduction was based on an inadequate examination, the reduction is void ab initio and the 10 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected eczema to include tinea corporis/cruris/pedis must be restored.
