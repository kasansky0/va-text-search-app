ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

In a correspondence dated March 18, 2025, the Veteran's authorized representative withdrew his appeal of the issues of entitlement to service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of the claim of entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2), (d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for withdrawal of the claim of entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2), (d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2001 to November 2001, from July 2002 to September 2002, and from June 2004 to June 2005.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran submitted an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, identifying the July 2023 rating decision.  In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran included a service connection claim for a congenital kinked right aortic arch and subclavian artery of aberrant origin with proximal stenosis in his August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.  However, the Board finds that the issue is not properly before the Board for adjudication and will not be addressed herein.  Specifically, a July 2005 rating decision denied the claim and the Veteran did not file a Notice of Disagreement within one year from the date the AOJ mailed notice of the rating decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.203.  As such, the Veteran's appeal is untimely and not properly before the Board on appeal.           

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.

In the present case, the Veteran, through a written correspondence from his authorized representative, received on March 18, 2025, has withdrawn the issues of entitlement to service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  The Board will therefore consider the issues of entitlement to service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy withdrawn.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2), (d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the issues on appeal and each claim is dismissed.
