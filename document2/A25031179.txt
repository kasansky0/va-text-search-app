REMANDED

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic left ankle sprain is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2003 to January 2008.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice  of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service connection for OSA

Under the AMA, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2)?AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.?See?38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).

The issue of entitlement to service connection for OSA is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the September 2023 rating decision on appeal. The AOJ did not obtain a medical opinion regarding whether OSA was caused or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected PTSD and chronic left ankle sprain. However, based on the evidence associated with the claims file prior to the September 2023 rating decision, the Board finds that a VA medical opinion was required to determine whether OSA was caused or aggravated by the service-connected PTSD and chronic left ankle sprain. 

In a July 2023 medical opinion, a private physician concluded the Veteran's weight gain was due to his service-connected PTSD and chronic left ankle sprain and his overweight condition led to, caused, and/or aggravated his OSA. The physician noted that the Veteran has service-connected disabilities that can lead to pain and painful motion and overeating which can lead to diminished activity with less caloric expenditure which leads to and/or promotes weight gain. The physician then noted that weight gain predisposes people to and directly causes OSA. See July 5, 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

The AOJ provided the Veteran an examination in July 2023. See August 14, 2023 C&P Exam. While the examiner provided opinions on whether the Veteran's OSA had its onset in service or was related to service, to include any toxic exposure risk activities (TERA), the examiner did not provide an opinion on whether his OSA was caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD or left ankle disability. The examiner did not even address the private medical opinion. While the private medical opinion contains inadequate rationale for the Board to grant service connection for OSA, it did warrant an opinion on the matter. Thus, the AOJ should have requested a supplemental opinion on the secondary aspect of the claim. 

The Board notes that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that obesity as an "intermediate step" in a causal chain for service connection can be established on either a causal or aggravation basis. See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 306-307 (2020). Furthermore, the Court concluded that General Counsel Precedent Opinion 1-2017, which determined that obesity could constitute an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a disability that may be service connected on a secondary basis, not only applies when a service-connected disability causes obesity, but also when a service-connected disability aggravates obesity. See Id.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a supplemental medical opinion on the etiology of the Veteran's OSA. Specifically, the examiner should address the following:

(a.) State whether it is at least as likely as not the Veteran's OSA was caused by his service-connected PTSD and/or chronic left ankle sprain.

(b.) State whether it is at least as likely as not the Veteran's OSA was aggravated by his service-connected PTSD and/or chronic left ankle sprain.

(c.) State whether it is at least as likely as not the Veteran's service-connected PTSD and/or chronic left ankle sprain caused or aggravated his weight gain.

(d.) If the answer to (c) is yes, the examiner should state whether it is at least as likely as not: 1) the obesity, or aggravation of obesity, was a substantial factor in causing the Veteran's OSA and 2) whether the Veteran's OSA would not have occurred but for the obesity caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD and/or chronic left ankle sprain.

In rendering these opinions, the examiner should acknowledge and address the following:

(a.) The Veteran sprained his left ankle in January 2003 and gained about 20 pounds since entering service, weighing 185 pounds at his separation examination in December 2007 (he weighed 200 pounds and had a body mass index (BMI) of 27 earlier that month). See February 11, 2008 STR - Medical.

(b.) VA treatment records show the Veteran weighed 183 pounds in November 2013 with a BMI of 26 and his BMI has been either 25 or 26 through 2017. See June 26, 2018 CAPRI; July 17, 2018 CAPRI; February 11, 2020 CAPRI.

(c.) A July 2023 statement in which the Veteran indicated his PTSD results in a lack of motivation and social withdrawal. See July 5, 2023 VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim. 

(d.) A July 2023 statement in which the Veteran indicated his chronic left ankle sprain prevents him from exercising. See July 5, 2023 VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim.

(e.) A July 2023 VA PTSD examination report indicating the Veteran had markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities and disturbances of motivation and mood. See July 19, 2023 C&P Exam.

(f.) A July 2023 VA ankle examination report noting the examiner's statement the Veteran would have difficulty with jogging or walking long distances due to his left ankle sprain. See August 14, 2023 C&P Exam. 

The examiner should provide a complete rationale for all conclusions.
