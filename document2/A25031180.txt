DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for residuals of a traumatic brain injury (claimed as concussion) (TBI residuals) is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for migraines, secondary to service-connected TBI, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his TBI residuals are at least as likely as not related to service.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his migraines are due to his service-connected TBI. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for TBI residuals are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for migraines, secondary to service-connected TBI, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2003 to May 2008.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for TBI residuals

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for a TBI. See May 2024 VA Form 10182.

The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In the August 2023 rating decision, the AOJ made a finding of a TBI diagnosis. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

According to a September 2019 Statement, during service, the Veteran was in a vehicle incident where he ran into a barrier and broke his nose. In his May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran said that he had a "concussion from my HMMWV accident in Fallujah in Dec 2004." 

A September 2021 VA treatment record addresses a TBI screening that revealed that, during deployment, the Veteran experienced a vehicular accident and a blow to the head, which resulted in loss of consciousness; being dazed, confused, or "seeing stars;" and not remembering the event. This resulted in memory problems, balance problems or dizziness, sensitivity to bright light, irritability, headaches, and sleep problems that continued to the present. 

According to an October 2021 VA treatment record, the provider found that "[b]ased on our clinical assessment today, [the Veteran] sustained a mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) during his deployment to Iraq in 2004."

According to another October 2021 VA treatment record, the Veteran reported exposure to three explosions, feeling the blast wave. The Veteran experienced a Humvee accident that resulted in ten-to-fifteen seconds of loss of consciousness, which left him dazed for five minutes. 

While there is no adequate VA medical opinion of record, this is not fatal to the Veteran's claim. VA treatment records clearly find that he had a TBI due to an in-service event. Therefore, the Board finds all the elements of service connection are met. 

Therefore, after resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for TBI residuals is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to service connection for migraines, secondary to service-connected TBI 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for migraines. See May 2024 VA Form 10182.

In his May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran said that his migraines were due to "burn pits in Iraq and my concussion from my HMMWV accident in Fallujah in Dec 2004."

Service connection on a secondary basis requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) evidence establishing that the service-connected disability either (a) caused, or (b) aggravated, the nonservice-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (invalidating the requirement of "proximate cause" and instead held a "but for" causation or aggravation is enough to show entitlement to secondary service connection).

In the August 2023 rating decision, the AOJ made a finding of a current disability. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Further, the Board decision herein has granted service connection for a TBI. Therefore, the remaining question is whether there is causation or aggravation. 

In August 2023, VA obtained a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) medical opinion. According to the examiner, the Veteran's headaches were not as a result of his TERA exposure. Rather, the Veteran's migraines are post traumatic in nature and the result of a TBI. This is also supported by a May 2023 VA treatment record that says of the Veteran's headaches, "[w]ith his description of these headaches starting initially intermittently post TBI and progressing to daily, this is most likely post traumatic migraine."

The Board finds this August 2023 opinion adequate to grant service connection for migraines on a secondary basis because it relies on the Veteran's medical history and clearly relates the Veteran's migraines to his now-service-connected TBI. 

Therefore, after resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for migraines, secondary to TBI, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
