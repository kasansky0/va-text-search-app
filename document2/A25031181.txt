ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 23, 2018, for the grant of service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymia, anxiety disorder, and mood disorder (hereinafter PTSD) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's initial claim for service connection for PTSD was denied in a November 2000 rating decision. 

2. The RO issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) in September 2011. The Veteran did not file a substantive appeal or submit new and material evidence within 60 days of its issuance and so the November 2000 rating decision and September 2011 SOC are final.

3.  On February 23, 2018, VA received a VA Form 526EZ Fully Developed Claim requesting service connection for a psychiatric disability.

4. Nothing submitted prior to the February 23, 2018, can be construed as a formal or informal request to reopen his previously denied claim for service connection for PTSD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to February 23, 2018, for the grant of service connection for PTSD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5103A, 5107, 5108, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400, 3.2500, 3.2501.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service with the United States Marine Corps from August 1986 to August 1991. Among other commendations, the Veteran was awarded the Southwest Asia Service Medal with 2 Bronze Stars.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim of an earlier effective date for service connection for PTSD, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Missed Issue

The Board acknowledges the representative's contention that there was a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the RO's November 2000 rating decision. 

In the event a claimant has asserted that there is CUE in a prior final rating decision, but CUE has not been adjudicated in the first instance by the RO, the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) does not allow for the CUE issue to be referred to the RO for adjudication. Additionally, if a CUE motion was filed prior to the issuance of the AMA decision on appeal but CUE was not adjudicated in that decision, or if not all the theories of CUE have been adjudicated in the first instance, those are considered "missed issues" and the Board does not have jurisdiction over it.

The Veteran's theory of CUE was not adjudicated by the RO in the January 2024 rating decision. Therefore, the Board cannot adjudicate the CUE claim in this instance as the claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date is a separate claim. Phillips v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 25 (1997) (noting that a CUE motion and a claim seeking an earlier effective date are not the same or inextricably intertwined because while the effective date element flows directly from the award of service connection, a CUE motion may be brought at any time and is premised upon an error in a prior final RO adjudication). Thus, the Board will reach the merits of the claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date as detailed below. The Veteran may resubmit the claim to the RO or notify the RO that the issue of CUE is still pending.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 23, 2018, for the grant of service connection for PTSD

The representative contends that the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of October 28, 1999. He contends that the RO made a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the November 2000 rating decision. See August 2024 Third Party Correspondence. As explained above, the Board will not address the CUE claim.

Based on the following, the Board finds that an earlier effective date prior to February 23, 2018, for the grant of service connection for PTSD is not warranted.

Procedural History

On October 28, 1999 the Veteran filed an initial claim for service connection for PTSD. In a November 2000 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder. A Statement of the Case (SOC) was issued in September 2011. The letter included with the SOC noted the Veteran had submitted a January 2001 Notice of Disagreement to the November 2000 rating decision, which had been overlooked, and that the Veteran's 1999 claim was still pending. (The Board notes that the January 2001 Notice of Disagreement is not in the Veteran's claims file). 

The Veteran did not perfect his appeal or submit new and material evidence within 60 days of issuance of the SOC. As such, the November 2000 rating decision and September 2011 SOC are final based on the evidence then of record. Therefore, the October 28, 1999 claim cannot serve as the basis for an earlier effective date.

In February 2018, the Veteran filed a legacy system claim to reopen service connection for a psychiatric disability. A November 2018 rating decision denied his claim. He filed a timely Notice of Disagreement in August 2019. A SOC was issued on March 26, 2020. On May 27, 2020 the Veteran attempted to opt into the modernized review system by filing VA Form 10182.

In June 2021 the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, which included an Appellate Brief arguing the effective date of service connection for PTSD back to February 23, 2018, and an extension request under VBA Policy Letter 20-02 Update Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Claims and Appeals Processing Guidance dated August 27, 2020, and rescinded on June 10, 2023. The extension request was granted, and the Veteran's May 2020 Notice of Disagreement was docketed.

The Board then issued a decision in January 2024 granting service connection for PTSD and MDD. A January 2024 rating decision effectuated the grant of service connection and assigned a 70 percent rating, effective February 23, 2018.

Law

Generally, the effective date of an award is the date the claim was received by VA, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, for claims filed more than one year after separation from service. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 1999).

For claims filed prior to March 24, 2015, a communication not on the appropriate form is treated as an informal claim provided that the communication or action indicates an intention to apply for one or more benefits and identifies the benefit sought. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a). VA then will send a claimant a formal application in response to the informal claim. If the formal application form is returned within 1 year from the date it was sent to the claimant, the effective date for the award of service connection will be the date of the informal claim. Id.

Effective March 24, 2015, a change in regulation requires claims be filed on standard forms, eliminating constructive receipt of claims and informal claims. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.150, 3.155, 3.160. The new regulation provides a claimant may request an application for benefits, upon receipt of which, the Secretary shall notify the claimant of the information necessary to complete the application form or form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. 

The regulation also allows a claimant to submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed form within one year. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

Before February 19, 2019, a Veteran could file a VA Form 21-526EZ to have a previously denied claim reopened and re-adjudicated. But, on February 19, 2019, the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) went into effect. Under the AMA, a VA Form 21-526EZ is no longer accepted as the proper application form to reopen a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160 (d)(2).

Where a prior unappealed decision becomes final, the effective date of a subsequent award of service connection is the date of receipt of the subsequently filed application to reopen and not the date of receipt of the original claim. Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d 1333, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2005). There is no provision in either the statute or the regulations that allows for an earlier effective date based on a reopened claim unless a CUE was committed in a prior decision, or unless the new and relevant evidence resulted from receipt of additional relevant military records. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(i); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.156(c).

Under the AMA, a Veteran who wants to reopen a claim must file a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. Id. If the supplemental claim does not meet all the requirements of a complete claim, to include the filing of the proper form, the VA may consider the claim to be an incomplete claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Analysis

The Veteran's September 2011 SOC became final as the Veteran did not file a substantive appeal nor submit new and material evidence within the applicable time period. Thus, the November 2000 rating decision and September 2011 SOC became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.160(d), 3.156(b), 20.302, 20.1103. 

The next correspondence relating to service connection for a psychiatric disability was received on February 23, 2018. There is no earlier communication indicating the Veteran's intent to reopen the previously denied claim. Thus, February 23, 2018 is the date of claim.

The Board notes the Veteran's contention that his VA treatment records show that he had a psychiatric disability since October 1999. However, as noted, 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 provides that any award based on a claim to reopen can be made effective no earlier than the date of the new application.  As outlined above, the date of receipt of the claim to reopen entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability  was February 23, 2018.

Although the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's arguments, the earliest date that may be assigned is the date VA received the Veteran's February 23, 2018, VA Form 526EZ Fully Developed Claim. 

For the above reasons, the Board finds that the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether entitlement to an earlier effective date is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim.  Therefore, the benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), is not for application as to this claim.  Lynch, supra.

Accordingly, the claim must be denied.
