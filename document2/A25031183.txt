ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for unspecified anxiety and depressive (UAD) disorder with insomnia disorder, is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due solely to the service connected UAD disability is granted effective beginning July 24, 2021, but no earlier, through May 30, 2022.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the entire rating period on appeal, the Veteran's UAD was productive of occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas.

2. The Veteran's UAD has not more nearly approximated total social impairment.

3. The Veteran's service connected UAD disability prevented him from obtaining or maintaining a substantially gainful occupation from July 24, 2021, to May 30, 2022.

4. The Veteran is service connected for UAD and now a TDIU which is considered a total disability; however, the Veteran does not have an additional disability rating of at least 60 percent disabling causing him to be unable to secure substantially gainful employment.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. For the entire rating period on appeal, the criteria for a rating of 70 percent, but no higher, for UAD have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130; Diagnostic Code (DC) 9413. 

2. The criteria to establish entitlement for a TDIU are met from March 31, 2019, through May 30, 2022.  38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2002 to January 2007.

This matter was initially denied in an April 2020 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), denying both the Veteran's increased rating claim for UAD and the claim for TDIU.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision.

In July 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits for an increase in his UAD disability rating.  The AOJ subsequently denied this claim in an October 2021 rating decision.  

In January 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review for increased rating for UAD.  The AOJ denied the Veteran's claim in a January 2022 rating decision.

In June 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim Application for increased rating for UAD.  The Veteran also submitted a VA 21-8940 Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability in September 2022 claiming anxiety causes an inability to secure substantially gainful employment.  The AOJ denied the Veteran's increased rating claim in a September 2022 rating decision.

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review of the September 2022 rating decision for increased rating for UAD.   The AOJ again denied the Veteran's claim for an increased rating in an April 2023 rating decision. The rating decision did not contain a determination of TDIU. 

The Veteran timely filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), in February 2024, appealing the April 2023 rating decision, to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), requesting the Direct Review option.  Therefore, any evidence submitted after the September 2022 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher level review, cannot be considered by the Board.? 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.? 

As an initial matter, the Board acknowledges the issue of a TDIU has been raised by the record during the pendency of the instant increased rating claim.  The Board's extensive review of this file indicates that the issue of TDIU has been inferred throughout the period on appeal. Because the issue was raised during the pendency of an increased rating claim, the Board has jurisdiction to award an effective date during any point of the rating period on appeal, if warranted.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  Therefore, the Board is expanding the Veteran's claim to include the issue of TDIU.  The Board also notes the Veteran's representative raised the issue in the "Addendum to VA Form VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)" attached to the Veteran's February 2024 appeal, proffered as argument.  

Additionally, the Board notes a TDIU is granted below due to the Veteran's service-connected UAD, and this disability satisfies the requirement of a "service-connected disability rated as total."  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22 V et. App. 280 (2008).  However, as noted below the Veteran does not have an additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from this now total disability.  Therefore, the statutory requirements for special monthly compensation are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i).

As an initial matter, the Board notes there are 3 NODs of record for the instant appeal.  Each NOD is identical, regarding the Veteran's increased rating claim with a representative's brief attached; however, the first NOD filed is the NOD that was docketed.  The Board finds that the initial NOD was properly docketed, and a docket switch was not attempted.  Therefore, the Board will proceed with adjudication. 

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  See U.S.C. §1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  When there is a question as to which of two evaluations applies, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for the rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In evaluating the severity of a disability, it is essential to consider its history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

That said, higher evaluations may be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).  This practice is known as staged ratings.  Id.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 39 C.F.R. §§ 3.102.

1. Entitlement to an increased rating for unspecified anxiety and depressive (UAD) disorder with insomnia disorder, for the entire period on appeal is denied.

The Veteran contends that his UAD is more severe than is contemplated by his existing rating.  The Veteran is currently rated at 70 percent disabling from December 7, 2015.

The Veteran's PTSD is rated under DC 9413.  Pursuant to a General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, specified in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, a 70 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals that interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control (e.g., unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (e.g., work or work like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

A 100 percent rating is warranted for total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9413, General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.

The symptoms associated with each rating under the General Rating Formula do not constitute an exhaustive list, but rather serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating.  See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002).  Thus, the evidence considered in determining the appropriate rating of a psychiatric disorder is not restricted to the symptoms set forth in the General Rating Formula.  See id.

When rating a mental disorder, VA must consider the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission.  38 C.F.R. § 4.126; Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 117 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  VA shall assign a rating based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination.  38 C.F.R. § 4.126(a).  When rating the level of disability from a mental disorder, VA will consider the extent of social impairment, but shall not assign a rating solely on the basis of social impairment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(b).

In other words, VA must engage in a holistic analysis that assesses the severity, frequency, and duration of the signs and symptoms of the psychiatric disability; quantifies the level of occupational and social impairment caused by those symptoms; and assigns an evaluation that most nearly approximates the level of occupational and social impairment.  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017).

Upon review, the Board finds the medical evidence, coupled with the lay evidence, indicates the Veteran's PTSD has not met or approximated the criteria for a rating in excess of 70 percent at any time during the appellate period.

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the Veteran's VA treatment records associated with the claims file for the entire period on appeal.  In summary, these records reflect ongoing treatment and medication for UAD as well as vocational rehabilitation.  Specifically, the records demonstrate the Veteran's history of posttraumatic stress disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, anxiety, and insomnia.  The Veteran's VA treatment records also show a systemic denial of suicidal and homicidal ideations throughout the period on appeal.

The Board has also reviewed the August 2021 VA examination afforded to the Veteran in which the examiner confirmed various psychiatric diagnoses including unspecified depressive disorder, unspecified anxiety disorder, and insomnia disorder.  At that time, the Veteran's symptoms included: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks weekly or less, chronic sleep impairment, impaired judgment, disturbances in motivation/mood; difficulty establishing/maintaining work relationships; difficulty adapting to stressful situations; and an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. The examiner concluded that the Veteran is deficient in most areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood.  The examiner described the Veteran as punctual, neatly dressed, clear speech, alert, cooperative, oriented to person/time/place/situation, logical, coherent and goal directed, with normal affect and congruent mood, as well as having good insight and judgment.  The examiner further noted the Veteran denied suicidal ideations and there was no evidence of delusions or hallucinations.  The examiner ultimately noted the Veteran's symptoms had worsened but did not rise to a level which would prompt a change in the service-connected diagnosis.

Additionally, the Board has reviewed the Veteran's lay statement associated with the claims file.  The Veteran reported symptoms including: anger; anxiety; chronic sleep problems; confusion; danger of hurting self or others; depression; difficulty coping with stress, making decisions, thinking straight, understanding commands; distractible; drug or alcohol abuse; emotional numbing; flashbacks; guilt;  hypervigilance or obsessively checking if things are safe; inability to make or keep friends; intrusive thoughts; isolation; lack of emotion; lack of friends; little interest in activities or hobbies once enjoyed; low motivation; low self-esteem; mania; memory problems; mood swings; negative thoughts about self/others/the world; neglect of chores or tasks; neglect of family; neglect of personal hygiene; over concern with personal hygiene; panic attacks; paranoia; poor concentration; poor judgment; problems at work, getting along with people, communicating; sense of helplessness; sexual disfunction; speech not communicating emotion; and suicidal thoughts or feelings; suspiciousness; unable to share feelings; and violent outbursts.

Given the nature, frequency and severity of the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms as shown by the cumulative evidentiary record, the Board finds that the Veteran's level of functioning has more nearly approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas warranting a 70 percent rating.  This is supported by the August 2021 VA examination in which the examiner opined, after an in-person interview/examination of the Veteran and review of his records, that the Veteran's overall functioning resulted in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood.  This is also supported by the Veteran's June 2022 lay statement, which reflects suicidal ideation - a symptom found in the 70 percent rating criteria.

While the Veteran seeks a rating in excess of 70 percent, the Board finds that the medical and lay evidence does not support a higher rating.  Total occupational and social impairment, warranting a 100 percent rating, was simply not shown in this record.  There was no evidence of gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of closest relatives, own occupation, or own name.

The Board has considered the competent medical and lay evidence within the record.  Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Board gives the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; "Put differently, if the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance (which includes but is not limited to equipoise), the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt."  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

Here the evidence is not in approximate balance; the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's UAD symptoms, during the period on appeal, warrant a rating higher than 70 percent.  As the persuasive evidence is against the claim for a rating in excess of 70 percent for UAD, the claim is denied.

2. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due solely to the service connected UAD disability is granted effective beginning July 24, 2021, but no earlier, through May 30, 2022.

It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities are rated totally disabled.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  A finding of total disability is appropriate "when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation."  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340 (a)(1), 4.15.  

A TDIU may be assigned when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  If there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, with sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id.  For the period on review, service connection was in effect as follows: UAD rated at 70 percent, effective December 7, 2016; internal or external hemorrhoids associated with UAD at 20 percent, effective June 27, 2022; tinnitus at 10 percent, effective April, 28, 2015; and irritable bowel syndrome associated with UAD at 0 percent, effective June 27, 2022.

Entitlement to a total rating must be based solely on the impact of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities on his ability to keep and maintain substantially gainful employment.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability."  Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).  For VA purposes, the term "unemployability" is synonymous with an inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation.  VAOPGPREC 75-91; 57 Fed. Reg. 2317 (1992).

The term "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" in § 4.16(b) has two components: one economic and one noneconomic.  The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person.  The non-economic component includes consideration of the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the Veteran has the physical ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.  Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 72-73 (2019).

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) defined "employment in a protected environment" within 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) to unambiguously mean "a lower-income position that, due to the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market."  LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111 (2024).

In a claim for TDIU, the ultimate question of whether a Veteran is capable of substantially gainful employment is not a medical one; that determination is for the adjudicator.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a); see also Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (noting that "applicable regulations place responsibility for the ultimate TDIU determination on the adjudicator, not a medical examiner"). When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Continuous Pursuit

The Veteran filed an application for increased compensation based on unemployability due to his psychiatric disabilities in February 2020 and again in September 2022.  The Board notes a review of the record reveals this is not the first instance where the issue of the Veteran's unemployability due to his service-connected psychiatric disability has been raised.  See, e.g., December 2014 VA Treatment Record (Homeless Call Center Referral Note); August 2015 VA Treatment Record (Mental Health Integrated Assessment Note); September 2017 VA Treatment Record (Mental Health Same Day Assessment Screening); March 2018 VA Treatment Record (Mental MD Outpatient Visit Note).

In September 2017, the Veteran applied for a TDIU due to hammertoe.  At that time, the RO denied the claim, in a January 2019 rating decision, as the Veteran was not service connected for hammertoe.  The Veteran did not appeal.  

In February 2020, the Veteran again applied for a TDIU based on his psychiatric disability submitting both a VA 21-8940 Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability and a VA 21-526EZ Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.  The RO denied the claim in an April 2020 rating decision, and the Veteran did not appeal. 

Therefore, the Board finds the Veteran did not continuously pursue a TDIU.

However, as noted above, the Veteran then filed for an increased rating, submitting a VA 21-526EZ in July 2021, which reasonably raised the issue of TDIU on a schedular basis.

Analysis

The Veteran is college educated, and, after leaving the military, worked in various jobs for relatively short periods of time.  See February 2020, September 2022 Application for Increased Compensation based on Unemployability.  

The Board notes the March 2020 and August 2021 VA examinations afforded to the Veteran for UAD reflect his occupational history has been limited by his tendency to be "aggressive" or "argumentative" on the job.  See March 2020 VA Examination (noting the Veteran has had 10 jobs since separation from service); see also August 2021 VA Examination (noting no change in occupational history since last examination).  The Board further notes the March 2020 examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms are not considered of the nature or severity that would preclude gainful employment noting the Veteran may become "emotionally overwhelmed and unfocused," but not to a degree that would preclude him from all types of employment.

Conversely, the Veteran's VA treatment records demonstrate a pattern in which the Veteran is able to obtain employment; however, shortly thereafter is let go due to his psychiatric symptoms.  See generally 2021 to 2022 VA Treatment Records.  Specifically, the Veteran's mental health treating physicians regularly noted the Veteran's anxiety, hypervigilance, and irritability, when triggered sometimes led to jail time and zero tolerance policies with employers historically led to job loss.  The record further demonstrates the Veteran was willing to find work and largely cooperated with Mental Health Vocational Rehabilitation advocates in obtaining employment.  Indeed, the Veteran successfully obtained and maintained employment in 2022.  VA Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors noted the Veteran reported enjoying this new position as working nights did not require the Veteran to engage socially.  See July 1, 2022, VA Treatment Record (Vocational Rehabilitation note: "they got me working nights now which is better for me because I'm up at night...[b]ut I like working nights because I don't have to deal with too many people, and it's more money.").  

The record is silent for any evidence of "substantially gainful employment" from the date the Veteran filed his claim, July 24, 2021, through May 30, 2022. May 31, 2022 is the reported start date for the Veteran's employment after successfully completing his vocational rehabilitation.  The Board notes there is no further evidence of unemployability of record, during the period on appeal.  It appears that the vocational rehabilitation was successful in that from the available evidence the Veteran was engaged in substantially gainful employment from May 31, 2022.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran later applied for a TDIU in January 2025, however, the application is outside of the period on appeal before the Board.  The Board reminds the Veteran that the duty to assist is not a one-way street; a claimant is obligated to cooperate in the development of a pending claim.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).  In short, failure to appear for examinations, as scheduled and with proper notice, may result in the denial of the issue on appeal.  See, 38 CFR § 3.158, Jernigan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet App 220 (2012).

?

The Board finds that overall, the Veteran's symptoms caused by his psychiatric disability prohibited him from maintaining substantially gainful employment for the period from July 24, 2021, to May 30, 2022.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board concludes that entitlement to a schedular TDIU rating due to service-connected disabilities is warranted for the period of July 24, 2021, to May 30, 2022.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
