CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Veteran submitted a timely request for waiver of recovery of overpayment of Chapter 33 education benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5302 (a) (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 1.963 (2019).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from December 1990 to May 1991. The appellant is his son. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2022 administrative decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO). In March 2023, the appellant submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) under the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). In such election, the appellant requested Direct Review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Consequently, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the administrative decision on December 19, 2022. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

1. Whether a request for a waiver of overpayment was timely filed.

The appellant contends that his waiver request for his outstanding education benefit debt should be accepted as he was never originally notified of the debt and that there are extenuating circumstances. Specifically, the appellant stated his father, the Veteran, had the appellant's DEA benefit checks fraudulently deposited his own checking account and did not give the appellant the money, leaving the appellant with debt he did not know was created. See September 13, 2022 Electronic Submission.

By way of background, in August 2021, the appellant received a Certificate of Eligibility for educational benefits under the DEA program. He subsequently enrolled in Old Dominion University in August 2021. In February 2022, the appellant received a letter from the AOJ stating that due to his change in enrollment in August 2021, he was paid more than he was due and a debt was created. The AOJ also sent letters to the appellant in May 2022 and October 2022 regarding his debt stemming from August 2021.

A request for waiver of a debt, other than for loan guaranty, shall only be considered if made within 180 days following the date of a notice of the indebtedness to the debtor. The 180-day period may be extended if the individual requesting waiver demonstrated to the Chairperson of the Committee that, as a result of an error by either VA or the postal authorities, or due to other circumstances beyond the debtor's control, there was a delay in such individual's receipt of the notification of indebtedness beyond the time customarily required for mailing, including forwarding. If the requester does substantiate that there was such a delay in the receipt of the notice of indebtedness, the Chairperson shall direct that the 180-day period be computed from the date of the requester's actual receipt of the notice of indebtedness. See 38 C.F.R. § 1.963 (b); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5302 (a).

In this case, the appellant submitted a request for debt waiver on December 5, 2022; however, that request was denied as the AOJ found such request to be untimely. A review of the file reveals the last VA Debt Management Center (DMC) letter prior to the Veteran's waiver request was dated August 23, 2022. Although the letter did not say the appellant had only 180-days in which to request a waiver, that timeline would have given the appellant until February 19, 2023 to do so. In this regard, the Board observes that on September 13, 2022, the appellant submitted a request for waiver and an explantation of why he withdrew from classes and that he had not received his DEA benefits due to his father's alleged fraud. Therefore, the Board finds that the appellant did submit a timely waiver request.

As the Board finds that the Veteran's request for a waiver was timely, his appeal must be granted to this limited extent.

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to waiver of recovery of a payment for VA education benefits under Chapter 35 in the amount of $5,574.52, to include validity of the debt.

Although the Board regrets the additional delay, a remand is necessary to ensure that due process is followed and that there is a complete record upon which to decide the appellant's claim so that he is afforded every possible consideration. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

In the December 2022 VA decision on waiver of indebtedness, total indebtedness is marked as $5,574.52. However, in the year prior to the December 2022 decision, the Veteran received a March 2022 DMC letter stating the debt was $1,709.92. A June 2022 DMC letter stated the debt was $4,561.53, and the August 2022 DMC letter stated the debt was $4,585.86. While the Board understands the unpaid debt amount may increase over time due to interest and fees, the Board notes the debt amount rose from March 2022 to December 2022 by $3,364.60. Such a figure cannot be accounted for in interest and fees. Therefore, the correct amount of the Veteran's total debt is unclear.

Given this discrepancy, it is not entirely clear how the AOJ calculated the overpayment amount, either in the DMC letters or in its decision on waiver of indebtedness, and a remand is necessary to cure a pre-decisional duty to assist error and obtain a detailed, yet straightforward, accounting showing how the total overpayment debt was calculated.

As the Board found the Veteran's request for a waiver timely, and the DMC has not considered the appellant's timely waiver, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a waiver of recovery of overpayment of DEA education benefits must be remanded as well for adjudication on the merits in the first instance by the Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). See 38 C.F.R. § 1.963.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Complete an audit as to how the Veteran's total overpayment of Chapter 35 educational assistance benefits in the amounts of $5,574.42 was calculated. All amounts paid, to include the dates on which those payments were made, for each term must be listed separately and with specificity.

2. Then, provide a detailed, yet straightforward, accounting showing how the total overpayment debt was calculated, to include how it arrived at the December 2022 decision on waiver of indebtedness figure of $5,574.52.

3. Adjudicate the matter of whether a waiver of recovery of the overpayment of Chapter 35 educational assistance benefits is warranted in this case in accord with the principles of equity and good conscience.
