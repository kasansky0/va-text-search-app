ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for coronary artery disease, including as secondary to herbicide exposure, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was exposed to the herbicide agent, Agent Orange, during his service in Okinawa, Japan from 1964 to 1966.  

2. The Veteran has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for coronary artery disease, as secondary to exposure to herbicides agents, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a)(b), 3.307(b), 3.309(e). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Army from February 1964 to October 1969.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of his appeal in November 2023.  The appellant is his surviving spouse.  The Board extends its sincere condolences to the appellant for the loss of her husband and recognizes the valuable service that he provided to this country in the United States Army. 

A December 2023 letter reflects that she has been accepted as the Veteran's substitution for purposes of processing his appeal to completion.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5121A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010; see also 79 Fed. Reg. 52,977-52,985 (Sept. 5, 2014).

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2021 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In December 2021, the Board denied the Veteran's service connection claim for coronary artery disease.  The Appellant appealed this denial to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC or the Court), which issued a memorandum decision in December 2024.  The Court vacated the Board's decision denying entitlement to benefits for coronary artery disease on both a direct and presumptive bases.  Accordingly, the claim was remanded to the Board for further adjudication.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 38 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). The absence of any one element will result in denial of service connection.

A veteran who served in the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(f); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6)(iii), 3.307(d). "Service in the Republic of Vietnam" includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii). The presumption of exposure to herbicide agents has been extended to those veterans who served offshore of the Republic of Vietnam during the same time period. 38 U.S.C. § 1116A.  For purposes of this section, an offshore location is one that is not more than 12 nautical miles seaward of a line commencing on the southwestern demarcation line of the waters of Vietnam and Cambodia and intersecting at certain enumerated points. 

Section 3.307(a)(6) provides that the term "herbicide agent" means a chemical in an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962 and ending on May 7, 1975. In such circumstances, service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for the diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e), including coronary heart disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(ii). 

If a veteran did not serve in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era, actual exposure to an herbicide agent must be verified through the appropriate service department or other sources in order for the presumption of service connection for an herbicide agent related disease under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e) to be applicable. Exposure to an herbicide agent is not presumed in such instances.  However, once exposure to an herbicide agent has been established by the evidence of record, the presumption of service connection found in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e) for herbicide agent related diseases is applicable.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d); see also Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994). In other words, a presumption of service connection provided by law is not the sole method for showing causation in establishing a claim for service connection for disability due to herbicide exposure. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007) (holding that the availability of presumptive service connection for some conditions based on exposure to Agent Orange does not preclude direct service connection for other conditions based on exposure to Agent Orange).

1. Entitlement to service connection for coronary artery disease

The Veteran and Appellant have maintained that the Veteran developed coronary artery disease because of his exposure to herbicide agents while on active duty in Okinawa, Japan during the Vietnam era.  The Board agrees and finds that the elements of service connection have been met. 

With respect to current disability, the record demonstrates that the Veteran has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease.  Thus, a current disability has been established.  

With regard to in-service incurrence, the Veteran reported that he was stationed in Okinawa, Japan from 1964 to 1966, and his mission was to guard an ammunition dump where Agent Orange and many other chemicals were stored.  The Veteran further reported that he sprayed Agent Orange around the compound to kill weeds.  The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report observable events within the realm of his personal knowledge. Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 470-471 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  

Furthermore, the Board finds no reason to doubt the credibility of these statements, as they are consistent with military personnel records documenting that he was stationed in Okinawa "in a classified area with material up to and including SECRET."  Additionally, the Veteran submitted numerous articles indicating that the U.S. conducted top-secret tests of Agent Orange in Okinawa in 1962.  These articles also indicate that the key components of Agent Orange were discovered at a former military dumpsite in Okinawa City in 2014.  

The Board notes that development was conducted to confirm whether the Veteran or members of his unit were exposed to herbicide agents and a negative response was entered in July 2019 and August 2023.  Specifically, VA concluded that a search of the history for the Veteran's unit from 1962 to 1965 did not indicate that any personnel were exposed to Agent Orange or tactical herbicides.  

However, the Board has considered the evidence of record, and finds the Veteran consistently and credibly reported that, while stationed in Okinawa during the Vietnam era, he made direct contact with Agent Orange.  Given the totality of the evidence, which includes the Veteran's consistent and credible statements, the articles documenting the presence of Agent Orange in Okinawa in the 1960s, and the lack of contradictory evidence, the Board finds that the evidence it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran was exposed to herbicides in the Okinawa during the relevant period.  Consequently, the Veteran's exposure to Agent Orange has been established.  

Given that coronary artery disease is a condition that is presumed related to herbicide exposure under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307; 3.309(e); and 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2), service connection for this condition is warranted on this basis.  As such, service connection for coronary artery disease is granted.?
