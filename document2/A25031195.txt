DOCKET NO. 240812-463474
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus is related to hazardous noise exposure during service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service with the United States Navy from March 19, 1991, to January 4, 2001. 

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection requires evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Certain chronic diseases (to include tinnitus as an organic disease of the nervous system), may be service connected on a presumptive basis if manifested to a compensable degree within a specified period of time post service (one year for organic diseases of nervous system). 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). Nexus of a chronic disease listed in § 3.309(a) to service may be established by showing continuity of symptomatology following service. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338-40 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a claimant is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). The VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Where lay evidence is competent, the Board must weigh the competent lay evidence against the other evidence of record in determining credibility. See Buchanan v. Nicholson , 451 F.3d 1331, 1334-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006). However, the absence of corroborating records is an insufficient basis on which to find lay statements not credible. Id.

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran contends he has tinnitus due to hazardous noise exposure during service.

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability of tinnitus that is related to hazardous noise exposure during service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. 

§ 3.303(a).

The record reflects evidence both in favor of and against the Veteran's claim for tinnitus. 

The evidence against the claim includes a March 2024 VA examination for hearing loss and tinnitus, where the examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The examiner noted that there was no diagnosis of clinical hearing loss present on the day of examination. Therefore, a nexus could not be established between hearing loss and tinnitus and that there are no objective factors for which the etiology of tinnitus could be attributed. The examiner also based this finding on a lack of complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of tinnitus within the Veteran's service treatment records. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 does not preclude service connection for a current hearing disability where hearing was within normal limits on audiometric testing at separation from service); Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992) (finding that the lack of documented hearing loss while in service is not fatal to a claim for service connection.). However, the examiner failed to adequately discuss the Veteran's lay statements and because the VA examiner's opinion is based primarily upon the absence of documented hearing loss and complaints in service, the Board finds the opinion to be of little probative value. See Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 389 (2010).

The evidence in favor of the claim includes a February 2024 private medical opinion. The physician found that while in service, the Veteran was in close proximity to ship noise, engines, turbines, tools, compressors and small arms fire. Moreover, he was exposed to hazardous noise as a Machinist Mate; an MOS that carries a high probability of hazardous noise exposure. Upon review of the Veteran's military and service treatment records, medical studies and literature, the physician ultimately determined the Veteran's tinnitus was more likely than not a result of his military service. Additionally, during examination, the Veteran described the onset of his symptoms as well as reporting having experienced a constant ringing in his years for over 30 years (since service), negatively impacting his concentration and conversations. See February 2024 Private Medical Opinion. 

The Veteran is competent to report the symptoms of tinnitus during and since service and no sufficient evidence of record exists which would lead the Board to not find him credible in this regard. See Layno. Tinnitus is an inherently subjective disability and is therefore readily capable of lay diagnosis. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2014). 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current tinnitus disability is related to his in-service noise exposure.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for tinnitus disability is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
