DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for service connection for pulmonary fibrosis is dismissed. 

The appeal for service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease, valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction residuals, coronary artery bypass graft residuals atrial fibrillation, and abnormal right ventricular systolic function is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

In a November 2024 written statement, the Veteran's accredited representative withdrew the appeal for service connection for both pulmonary fibrosis and arteriosclerotic heart disease, valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction residuals, coronary artery bypass graft residuals atrial fibrillation, and abnormal right ventricular systolic function.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal for service connection for pulmonary fibrosis have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal for service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease, valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction residuals, coronary artery bypass graft residuals atrial fibrillation, and abnormal right ventricular systolic function have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from October 1966 to August 1970.

In August 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for pulmonary fibrosis and arteriosclerotic heart disease, valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction residuals, coronary artery bypass graft residuals atrial fibrillation, and abnormal right ventricular systolic function.  In November 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.

Withdrawal

In a November 2024 written statement, the Veteran's accredited representative conveyed that the Veteran "wishes to withdraw his appeal from BVA."

A veteran's accredited representative may withdraw a substantive appeal in writing at any time prior to the Board promulgation of a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  The Board finds that the Veteran's accredited representative has effectively withdrawn the appeal for service connection for pulmonary fibrosis and arteriosclerotic heart disease, valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction residuals, coronary artery bypass graft residuals atrial fibrillation, and abnormal right ventricular systolic function.  Therefore, the Board concludes that no allegation of fact or law remains as to those issues, and the appeal must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.
