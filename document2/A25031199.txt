ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus had its onset during active service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2004 to August 2008.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in July 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the underlying March 2024 rating decision that was subject of the request for Higher Level Review (HLR) addressed in the July 2024 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued this March 2024 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance or nearly equal-which includes but is not limited to equipoise-the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt-rule does not apply.  Id. at 781-82.

As a final preliminary matter, the Board notes the Veteran received notification of the rating decision on appeal in July 2024, and that the one-yar period to request a change of docket selected has not expired.  However, as the claim is being granted in full, the Veteran is not prejudiced by the Board's action in immediately granting this appeal.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for tinnitus due to in-service noise exposure.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).  Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury.  Id.; see also Caluza v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996). 

The AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran had been diagnosed with tinnitus, that he was exposed to hazardous noise during military service, and that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) during service.  

The remaining inquiry is whether there is a relationship between his tinnitus and his service.

The Veteran has submitted several lay statements indicating that his tinnitus had its onset during service following a deployment, and that the symptoms started with faint ringing in his ears.  Additionally, on VA examination in February 2024, the Veteran told the examiner the symptoms have worsened since onset, and he experiences constant ringing in both ears.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in August 2022 and February 2024.  The Board finds both examination reports are not adequate for adjudication; however, the Board does not find that a remand is necessary to correct them as the evidence currently supports service connection.

Review of the August 2022 VA examination reflects the Veteran reported recurrent tinnitus, but the examiner stated it is not "true tinnitus".  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's symptomatology is less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure, with the rationale that the Veteran's tinnitus is not accompanied by measurable hearing loss.  The examiner did not address the Veteran's statements related to the specific noise exposure as outlined by the Veteran, including exposure to generators and U2 jets while deployed, and did not address the Veteran's lay statements regarding onset following deployment.  The Board finds the VA examiner's opinion conclusory, and that such does not address the specifics of the Veteran's claim.  Moreover, the VA examiner does not provide the likely etiology of the Veteran's tinnitus.

Tinnitus is defined as "a noise in the ears, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking.  It is usually subjective in type." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 1956 (31st ed. 2007).  Because tinnitus is "subjective," its existence is generally determined by whether the veteran claims to experience it.  For VA purposes, tinnitus has been specifically found to be a disorder with symptoms that can be identified through lay observation alone.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  To that end, the Board has no reason to doubt the Veteran's reports of tinnitus since service.

Under VA regulations, tinnitus is a chronic disease under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a) as an 'organic disease of the nervous system.' Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 273 (2015).  Chronic diseases may be granted service connection on the basis of continuity of symptomatology.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b). Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Here, the Veteran has presented reports regarding having tinnitus symptoms since his deployment and that the symptoms worsened over time.  He is competent to report having the symptoms and diagnosis, and the Board finds his statements of onset and continuity are credible.  There is no evidence that contradicts his statements.

The Board places more weight on the Veteran's statements describing his experiences with tinnitus than on the VA examination opinions, which did not consider all relevant evidence.  

In reaching the above conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  The Board finds the evidence of record is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus had its onset during service.  Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, therefore, the Board finds service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38 C.F.R. §?3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
