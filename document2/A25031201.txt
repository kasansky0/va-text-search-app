ORDER

The appeal of the June 2024 rating decision that deferred the issue of an increased evaluation of right lower extremity muscle weakness secondary to multiple sclerosis was not ripe for appellate consideration and is therefore dismissed without prejudice.

FINDING OF FACT

1. In June 2024, a Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision deferring the issue of an increased evaluation of right lower extremity muscle weakness secondary to multiple sclerosis.

2. The June 2024 rating decision is not final.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal regarding the deferred issue of an increased evaluation of right lower extremity muscle weakness secondary to multiple sclerosis, contains no current allegations of error of law or fact and is not ripe for appellate consideration. Therefore, the criteria for dismissal of the claim without prejudice have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from May 2016 to June 2016 and the United States Army from May 2017 to August 2021.

The rating decision underlying the present appeal was issued in June 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305.  In Williams v. McDonough, the Court held the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  In the present case, the rating decision on appeal was issued on in June 2024.  Thus, the one-year period following the decision has not yet elapsed.  However, the decision below represents the most advantageous option for the Veteran.  Accordingly, there is no prejudice with the Board adjudicating the claim prior to the expiration of the one-year period, and delaying adjudication would needlessly delay the award of benefits to the Veteran with no potential benefit.  Thus, the Board will proceed to adjudicate the claim.  

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

Dismissal

In June 2024, a VA RO issued a rating decision deferring the issue of an increased evaluation of right lower extremity muscle weakness secondary to multiple sclerosis.  No decision on the particular issue was made at that time.  Written notification of the proposed reduction was sent that same month.

Therefore, the Veteran's July 2024 Notice of Disagreement was for a rating decision (June 2024) that was not final.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.

The Board thus finds there is no valid appeal for the appeal of deferred issue, and as such, lacks the jurisdiction to consider the Veteran's issue.  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.104, previously codified pre-AMA as 38 C.F.R. § 20.101, regarding jurisdiction of the Board, the Board may dismiss any case of which it determines it does not have jurisdiction.  Where the law is dispositive, the claim must be denied on the basis of absence of legal merit.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

The Board notes that a rating decision denying the Veteran an increased evaluation of right lower extremity muscle weakness secondary to multiple sclerosis was issued in July 2024.  As such, the Veteran may file a new Notice of Disagreement for that rating decision.  The Board encourages the Veteran to do as soon as possible so if he wishes to pursue his appeal.

The Board emphasizes that this dismissal is without prejudice and the Veteran is not precluded from appealing the issue.  Since there remains no allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration regarding the issue, the criteria for the dismissal of the issue is met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.
