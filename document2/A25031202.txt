ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 30, 2018, for the grant of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a decision dated on October 22, 2021, the Board granted an effective date of June 30, 2018, but not earlier, for TDIU.

2. The Veteran did not seek reconsideration of the Board's October 2021 decision, did not appeal that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), and has not alleged clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the October 2021 Board decision.

3. The rating decision on October 27, 2021, implemented the Board's decision to grant entitlement to TDIU effective June 30, 2018, but not earlier, involved no adjudication of any question of fact or law.

4. The VA Form 10182 filed in July 2024 does not reasonably qualify as a motion for reconsideration of the Board's prior decision.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the dismissal of the issue of entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 30, 2018, for the grant of entitlement to TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §20.201, Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (2023).  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from April 2009 to July 2012.  

The appeal arises from a Higher-Level Review rating decision dated on April 25, 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

By way of history, in a rating decision dated on May 9, 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU.  On May 14, 2024, the Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review claim on VA Form 20-0996, regarding the denial of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU.  In reviewing a Higher-Level Review rating decision, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the underlying rating decision for which the Veteran requested the Higher-Level Review (as that is the evidence that the AOJ was permitted to consider in the Higher-Level Review decision on appeal), which in the instant case is the rating decision on May 9, 2024.  As the Veteran in the July 2024 notice of disagreement selected the Direct Review lane, the Board may only consider evidence as of the rating decision on May 9, 2024.  If evidence was added to the record during an ineligible period identified above, the Board has not considered that evidence.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.

In the rating decision on May 9, 2024, the AOJ made the favorable finding that entitlement to TDIU was granted effective June 30, 2018.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

The Board notes that the time period has not elapsed for the Veteran to request an AMA docket switch as it is less than one year from the date the AOJ mailed notice of the decision on appeal.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  However, as discussed below, the case must be dismissed regardless of the docket elected.  Therefore, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in not waiting for the time period for an AMA docket switch request to elapse.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 30, 2018, for the grant of entitlement to TDIU.  

As discussed above, in a decision dated on October 22, 2021, the Board granted an effective date of June 30, 2018, but not earlier, for TDIU.  In a rating decision dated on October 27, 2021, the AOJ implemented the Board's grant of entitlement to TDIU effective June 30, 2018, stating that "(t)his decision represents a Board of Veterans' Appeals grant that is considered to be a full and final determination of this issue on appeal."  

On April 30, 2024, the Veteran's supplemental claim on VA Form 20-0995 was filed alleging clear and unmistakable error in failing to grant TDIU prior to June 30, 2018, in the rating decision dated on October 27, 2021.  In the rating decision dated on May 9, 2024, the AOJ determined that the decision to deny an effective date earlier than June 30, 2018, for TDIU was not a clear and unmistakable error.  On May 14, 2024, the Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review claim on VA Form 20-0996, regarding the denial of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU based on clear and unmistakable error decided in the rating decision dated on May 9, 2024.  In the Higher-Level Review rating decision dated on May 25, 2024, the AOJ determined that a de novo review found that the evidence did not support a change in the prior decision and therefore, entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU remained denied. 

In the July 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran contended that there was clear and unmistakable error in the rating decision on October 27, 2021, in failing to grant an earlier effective date for TDIU.  In a memorandum attached to the July 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran's attorney contended that there was clear and unmistakable error in the October 2021 rating decision as VA failed to correctly apply the provision of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16, failed to consider the Veteran's education and occupational history and relate those factors to his service-connected disability, and failed to consider a private vocational opinion.  The attorney requested that clear and unmistakable error be found in the rating decision on October 27, 2021, denying entitlement to TDIU from July 26, 2012, to June 30, 2018.  

The October 2021 rating decision was non-adjudicative, made no discission on any question of fact or law, and merely implemented the Board's October 2021 decision granting TDIU with an effective date of June 30, 2018, but not earlier.  As such, there was no adjudication of any issue, or even of any related or ancillary question, in the October 2021 rating decision, as the AOJ did not have the authority to assign an effective date contrary to the Board's order.  Smith v. Brown, 35 F.3d 1516, 1526 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (recognizing VA's administrative (RO)-judicial (BVA, appellate) review scheme, and declining to interpret a regulation in such a way that would, counter to that scheme, "oddly, permit an inferior [adjudicatory tribunal] to collaterally review the actions of a superior" appellate tribunal).

With few exceptions, Board decisions are final when issued.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1100.  As such, the October 2021 Board decision granting TDIU with an effective date of June 30, 2018, but no earlier, became final on October 22, 2021, the date of issuance of the Board decision.  Id. The Board's October 2021 decision was not appealed to the Court.  As noted by the Federal Circuit in Cook v. Principi, "principles of finality and res judicata apply to agency decisions that have not been appealed and have become final."  Cook v. Principi, 318 F.3d 1334, 1336 (2002).

There are two primary exceptions to the rule of finality, the reopening of a claim and/or revision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  Cook, 318 F.3d at 1337 (discussing 38 U.S.C. §§ 5108, 5109A, 7111).  

As no issue, or even a question of fact or law, was adjudicated by the AOJ in the October 2021 rating decision that merely implemented the Board's October 2021 decision, there can be no specific error of fact or law raised regarding the October 2021 rating decision; therefore, there is no error of fact or law before the Board at this time as to the effective date of June 30, 2018, assigned for TDIU.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (the Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege a specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed).  

The Board recognizes the holding in Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 31 (2023).  The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) therein held that a "pure implementation of a Board of Veterans' Appeals adjudication cannot be regarded as a decision affecting the provision of benefits under section 511(a) and cannot be appealed to the Board." Id. at 36.  However, the Court cautioned that the Board must consider whether an appeal of an implementing decision may be considered a motion for reconsideration of the Board decision.

Regulations state that a motion for reconsideration must be in writing and must include the name of the veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf); the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number; and the date of the Board of Veterans' Appeals decision, or decisions, to be reconsidered.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1002.

It must also set forth clearly and specifically the alleged obvious error, or errors, of fact or law in the applicable decision, or decisions, of the Board or other appropriate basis for requesting reconsideration.  If the applicable Board decision involved more than one issue on appeal, the motion for reconsideration must identify the specific issue, or issues, to which the motion pertains.  Issues not so identified will not be considered in the disposition of the motion.  Id. 

In reviewing the July 2024 notice of disagreement and accompanying contentions the Board finds that the Veteran did not request for the Board to reconsider the effective date assigned in the October 2021 Board decision and instead referred specifically to errors alleged in the implementing October 2021 rating decision.  The Board also notes the Veteran is represented by a private attorney, unlike the Appellant in Encarnacion, and the Board's duty to sympathetically read pro se filings as motions for reconsideration would not apply to the filings at issue in this appeal.

Consequently, the Board finds the July 2024 notice of disagreement with accompanying contentions does not reasonably qualify as a motion for reconsideration of the Board's earlier October 2021 decision under 38 U.S.C. § 7103 or 38 C.F.R. § 20.1002.  

As such, the appeal for an effective date earlier than June 30, 2018, for the grant of TDIU must be dismissed.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (where the law is dispositive, the claim must be denied due to a lack of legal merit).
