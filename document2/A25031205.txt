ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension (HTN) is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a March 31, 2023 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the Veteran's service connection claim for a right knee condition.

2. VA mailed notification of the decision regarding the right knee issue on April 4, 2023.

3. The Veteran did not initiate an appeal of the AOJ's March 31, 2023 rating decision during the one-year period following the mailing of notice of that decision.

4. In an April 26, 2024 and May 21, 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran requested direct review of the March 2023 rating decision.

5. A timely NOD pertaining to the March 2023 rating decision regarding the right knee was not received, nor has the Veteran requested an extension or provided good case as to why he did not timely appeal the March 2023 rating decision.

6. In a June 22, 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea; a June 26, 2023 letter notified the Veteran of this decision and his appellate rights.

7. On July 21, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the June 2023 rating decision regarding the issues of HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea.

8. In a March 2024 HLR decision, the AOJ stated that a duty to assist error had been identified during the HLR for HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea; and a March 12, 2024 letter notified the Veteran of this decision.

9. On May 21, 2024, the Veteran submitted the VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) pertinent to this appeal in which he selected the Direct Review docket and identified the June 26, 2023 date of the notification letter associated with the June 22, 2023 rating decision's denial of his service connection claims for HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea. 

10. The AOJ later issued an August 9, 2024 rating decision which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied entitlement to service connection for HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision; an August 12, 2024 letter notified the Veteran of this decision and his appellate rights.

11. The Veteran's submission of the May 21, 2024 VA Form 10182 was not valid for purposes of initiating an appeal of the June 22, 2023 rating decision associated with the June 26, 2023 notification letter as it was a concurrent election because review of the issues of entitlement to service connection for HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea was still ongoing in relation to the March 2023 HLR application and the correction of the error(s) identified upon HLR in the March 2024 decision.

12. Review of the issues of entitlement to service connection for HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea under the Direct Review docket in relation to May 21, 2024 VA Form 10182 would be procedurally inappropriate and constitute a claims processing error.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from February 1994 to October 1997.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions issued in March 2023 (right knee) and June 2023 (HTN, sleep apnea, sinusitis) by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

Procedurally, in March 2023, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition.  In June 2023, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea.  In May 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealing these two decisions and elected the Board's Direct Review docket.  

Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of March 31, 2023-the date of the AOJ decision on appeal, for the right knee issue.  For the HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea issues, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of June 22, 2023-the date of the AOJ decision on appeal for these issues.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after March 31, 2023 or June 22, 2023 for the respective noted issues, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition is dismissed.

Appellate review is initiated by filing a NOD.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  Except as provided for simultaneously contested claims, a NOD must be filed within one year from the date the AOJ issues a notice of the decision.  Id.; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500; 20.203.  If a NOD is not filed within the requisite one-year period, the decision of the AOJ becomes final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.160.  An extension of the period for filing a NOD may be granted for good cause.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

Although the Board may not dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction due to an untimely NOD, it may dismiss the appeal due to non-jurisdictional reasons, such as a procedural defect, where the claimant did not substantially comply with proper claims processing rules.  See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (stating VA can require a claimant to fill out a particular form and can dismiss nonconforming or untimely filings, but a failure to follow claims processing rules does not affect the Board's jurisdiction); see also, Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).

Here, to the extent the Veteran may have sought to appeal the AOJ's prior denial of service connection for a right knee condition, he did not comply with the claims processing rules.  Pursuant to an April 4, 2023 Notification Letter, regarding the March 31, 2023 rating decision, the AOJ notified the Veteran that he had one year from the date of the letter to select a review option if he disagreed with the AOJ's decision.  The Veteran did not file the Board NOD as to service connection for the right knee condition within the requisite period.

The Board has considered the applicability of any waiver that would permit extending the filing period, but finds no such evidence.  See generally Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (regulatory claims-processing rules may be waived without affecting jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal); Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37 (2009) (VA may implicitly or explicitly waive any issue of timeliness in the filing of a Substantive Appeal).

The Veteran herein did not file a motion for an extension and has not provided good cause to extend the filing period, and no other arguable waiver is applicable in this case.  38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) (time limits within which claimants or beneficiaries are required to act to perfect a claim or challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended for good cause shown); 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c) ("An extension of the period for filing a Notice of Disagreement or a request to modify a Notice of Disagreement may be granted for good cause.  A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board.").

At the time of the March 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was provided notice of the decision with instructions on how to appeal, to include RO and Board review options, the denial if he so chose.  See April 2023 Notification Letter.  The Board finds the Veteran was adequately informed of how and by when to appeal the portion of the March 2023 rating decision pertaining to the denial of service connection for a right knee disability.

Finally, the Board has considered whether it waived its right to enforce the filing deadline by virtue of docketing the appeal.  See, e.g., Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37 (2009) (holding VA waived any objection to the timeliness of the Veteran's legacy appeal "by treating the disability rating matter as if it were part of his timely filed Substantive Appeal for more than five years").  The Veteran filed his NOD in May 2024 and the Board sent a letter acknowledging receipt of the form and placement of the appeal on the direct docket, consistent with his election.  See June 5, 2024 BVA Docketing Letter.  The Board finds that this letter acknowledging receipt and the mere administrative act of assigning the attempted appeal a docket, in and of itself, does not constitute a waiver of timeliness.  Although the subject appeal was docketed as an automatic administrative action, unlike the circumstances of Percy, the Board did not continuously "engage in substantive and procedural development" of this appeal.  There is no action in which the Veteran would be under the impression that the merits of the case were examined and being developed in any substantive way.  The Board's notice of receipt of the Veteran's purported appeal did not convey any intent to forgo reliance on the laws applicable to docketing.  Thus, the facts herein are distinguishable from Percy and the Board finds the mere sending of the docketing letter did not constitute a waiver of the timeliness of a NOD.

Based on the foregoing, as no good cause has been shown and no waiver (implicit or explicit) was made as to the May 2024 NOD, the Board finds the May 2024 NOD was, and remains, untimely. As the Veteran's NOD is not a valid appeal of the March 2023 rating decision, the presently docketed appeal is dismissed based on his failure to comply with the claims processing rules.

In conclusion, the Board emphasizes that there was no appealable decision as to service connection for the right knee condition issued in the year prior to receipt of the May 2024 NOD.  Accordingly, the matter is not properly before the Board and is dismissed.

The Board notes that this decision does not leave the Veteran without recourse.  The Veteran is free to file a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, with new and relevant evidence, for service connection for his right knee condition.

2. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is dismissed.

3. Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is dismissed.

4. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

The AMA review system automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. §3.2400(a)(1).  As applicable to this case, under the AMA review system, within one year from the date on which the AOJ issues a notice of a decision on a claim or issue, except as otherwise provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (e), and (f), a claimant may elect one of the following administrative review options by timely filing the appropriate form prescribed by the Secretary: (i) a request for a higher-level review under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601; or (ii) an appeal to the Board under 38C.F.R. § 20.202. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)(1).  A claimant who has filed for review under of one of those options, may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for a review under a different available option.  38 C.F.R. §3.2500(b).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, an appeal to the Board must be initiated by the filing of a NOD in the form prescribed by the Secretary.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.201.  The NOD must be in writing and identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. §20.202(a).  The term issue means an adjudication of a specific entitlement as described in 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(c).  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).  Except as provided in the case of simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed NOD with a decision by the AOJ within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).  

The record shows that on June 22, 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea.  A June 26, 2023 letter notified the Veteran of this decision and his appellate rights under the modernized review system.

On July 21, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the June 2023 rating decision.  In response to this submission, the AOJ issued a March 2024 HLR decision in which it stated that a duty to assist error had been identified during the HLR for HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea.  The AOJ indicated that additional development was needed, including obtaining a full Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) memorandum as well as an examination and medical opinion for each issue.  A March 12, 2024 letter notified the Veteran of this decision.  A Subsequent Development Letter sent on March 22, 2024 to the Veteran similarly explained that after the AOJ corrected the error discovered during the HLR in assisting the Veteran to gather evidence to support his claim, the AOJ would forward the Veteran's claim for further processing and inform the Veteran of a new decision.

On April 26, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in which he selected the Direct Review docket and identified the June 26, 2023 date of notification associated with the June 22, 2023 rating decision's denial of his service connection claim for HTN, sleep apnea, and sinusitis.  In a May 9, 2024 letter, the Board notified the Veteran that the Board could not review the Veteran's case in relation to the submitted VA Form 10182 as the Veteran already requested a HLR or Supplemental Claim for the issue(s) listed on the form.  The letter explained that the Veteran could only choose one review option for each issue.

On May 21, 2024, the Veteran submitted the VA Form 10182 pertinent to this appeal in which he again selected the Direct Review docket and identified the June 26, 2023 date of notification associated with the June 22, 2023 rating decision's denial of his service connection claim for HTN, sleep apnea, and sinusitis.  The Board subsequently sent the Veteran letters on June 4, 2024 (sleep apnea) and June 5, 2024 (HTN and sinusitis) notifying him that his appeal had been placed on the Direct Review docket based on the Board appeal option he selected in the May 21, 2024 VA Form 10182.

The AOJ later issued an August 9, 2024 rating decision which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied entitlement to service connection for HTN, sleep apnea, and sinusitis based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  See Green v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 127, 136 (2024) (stating that an agency decision which post-dates the decision on appeal does not constitute "evidence" and as such, the decision need not have been of record at the time of the decision on appeal).  An August 12, 2024 letter notified the Veteran of this decision and his appellate rights under the modernized review system.  The Board notes that it is clear that the August 9, 2024 rating decision was issued in relation to the development that was conducted as a result of the duty to assist error identified in the March 2024 HLR decision.

In summary, the March 2024 HLR decision was issued in response to the Veteran's July 21, 2023 VA Form 20-0996 in which the Veteran requested review of the same June 2023 rating decision that the Veteran identified in the May 21, 2024 VA Form 10182.  However, the AOJ was still conducting development related to the duty to assist error that was identified in the March 2024 HLR decision when the Veteran submitted the May 21, 2024 VA Form 10182.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023) (stating that a claimant can file more than one administrative review request in response to an AOJ decision, provided that the requests are filed within one year of the AOJ decision and that the review requests are not pending concurrently).

To the extent that the May 21, 2024 VA Form 10182 was submitted within one year of the March 2024 HLR decision, the Board notes that the March 2024 HLR decision did not adjudicate the Veteran's service connection claims for HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea.  Instead, the AOJ only identified the presence of a duty to assist error related to these claims for which additional development was needed.  The March 2024 HLR decision was therefore not a decision subject to review under the modernized review system that the Veteran could appeal to the Board with the submission of the May 21, 2024 VA Form 10182.  It was informative as it noted the duty to assist errors and indicated that VA would further develop the issue to correct the identified error(s). Following the March 2024 HLR decision, the AOJ did not issue a rating decision adjudicating the merits of the Veteran's service connection claims until the August 9, 2024 rating decision, and the Veteran's prior submission of the May 21, 2024 VA Form 10182 also cannot function as a valid appeal of the subsequent August 9, 2024 rating decision.

Based on the foregoing, the Veteran's submission of the May 21, 2024 VA Form 10182 was not valid for purposes of initiating an appeal of the June 22, 2023 rating decision associated with the June 26, 2023 notification letter.  Further review of the issue of entitlement to service connection for HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea under the Direct Review docket in relation to the May 21, 2024 VA Form 10182 would be procedurally inappropriate and constitute a claims processing error.  The Veteran's appeal is therefore dismissed on this basis.

This decision does not leave the Veteran without recourse.  The Veteran is free to file one of the following for service connection for HTN, sinusitis, and sleep apnea, by citing to the August 9, 2024 rating decision: (1) VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, or (2) VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, or (3) VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.
