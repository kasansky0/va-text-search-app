ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of September 7, 2023 for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of April 17, 2023 for the grant of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed an intent to file a claim on April 17, 2023, and submitted a claim for an increased rating for lumbar strain with intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) in September 2023, within a year of receipt of the intent to file. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy is part and parcel of the increased rating claim for IVDS.

3. The evidence shows that September 7, 2023 is the date upon which entitlement arose for left lower extremity radiculopathy.  

4. The medical evidence shows that the Veteran had left lower extremity radiculopathy symptoms prior to receipt of the April 17, 2023 intent to file a claim. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for assignment of an effective date of September 7, 2023, for the award of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.160, 3.400, 3.2500.

2. The criteria for assignment of an effective date of April 17, 2023, for the award of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.160, 3.400, 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2012 to April 2021. 

This matter comes before the Board on appeal of a March 2024 higher level review rating decision, associated with a November 2023 rating decision, by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In March 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request, Board Appeal, Notice of Disagreement, under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), and selected direct review.

The Veteran is advised that under direct review the Board is only able to consider evidence received as of, and prior to, the November 2023 rating decision. Any evidence received after the November 2023 rating decision cannot be considered. If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Earlier Effective Dates

1. Entitlement to an effective date of September 7, 2023 for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy. 

2. Entitlement to an effective date of April 17, 2023 for the grant of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to earlier effectives dates for the grants of service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy because he requested an MRI since 2021 and did not receive one until 2023. The Board has considered the Veteran's argument. However, the Board is required to base its decision on the evidence before it and cannot contemplate what might have been had medical testing been done earlier.

The effective date of a grant of service connection is the day following separation from active service or date entitlement arose if claim is received within 1 year after separation from service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). 

In this case, the Veteran submitted a claim for a low back disability in April 2021. The Board acknowledges that a claim for a low back disability can include as part and parcel of the claim a claim for service connection for lower extremity radiculopathy. However, during the period of adjudication for the claim of entitlement to service connection for a low back disability the medical evidence did not show that the Veteran had lower extremity radiculopathy. 

An April 2021 VA primary care note demonstrates that the Veteran had pain of the lower back but his symptoms were negative for numbness, weakness, or tingling. In June 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA back examination, which indicated that the Veteran did not have radiculopathy. 

The Board acknowledges that a January 2017 medical note indicated that the Veteran had reported a new onset of radicular symptoms and that the Veteran met the criteria for low back pain. However, there was an unremarkable lumbar spine radiograph. It is also recognized that an October 2019 medical noted indicated that the Veteran had radicular symptoms starting in right knee going up the back of his leg into the lower back, and numbness/tingling into the posterior right buttock and thigh. Nonetheless, based on the medical evidence, there was no showing of lower extremity radiculopathy during the period of adjudication to raise the issue of entitlement to service connection for lower extremity radiculopathy related to the low back claim. In fact, the Veteran himself denied any lower extremity radicular symptoms during the adjudication period. Therefore, the Board finds that a claim for lower extremity radiculopathy was not part of the April 2021 low back claim. 

In July 2021, the AOJ issued a rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection. In August 2021, the Veteran submitted a higher level review request. In September 2021, entitlement to service connection for a lumbar strain was granted. In March 2022, the Veteran submitted a request for an increased rating for his lumbar strain. Although a claim for entitlement to service connection for lower extremity radiculopathy can be part and parcel of the claim for an increased rating for a lumbar strain, the medical evidence did not show that the Veteran had lower extremity radiculopathy during the period of adjudication.

A January 2022 VA medical note reveals that the Veteran had severe low back pain but it was non-radiating and he had no numbness or tingling. In April 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA back examination. The examiner determined that the Veteran had a diagnosis of IVDS, which was granted entitlement to service connection by an April 2022 rating decision. However, the April 2022 examiner also found that the Veteran did not have lower extremity radiculopathy. Therefore, the Board finds that a claim for lower extremity radiculopathy was not part and parcel of the March 2022 claim for an increased rating for the lower back. 

The Board acknowledges that under AMA, if a claimant continues to request an available review option within one year of each prior decision on an issue, the claimant can preserve the effective date associated with the initial claim. In order to use supplemental claims to continuously pursue review of an issue and thereby protect the earliest possible effective date in the event of an award of benefits, the supplemental claims must be filed within one year of notification of the last agency of original jurisdiction or Board decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). However, the Board cannot find that there was continued pursuit of a claim for entitlement to service connection for lower extremity radiculopathy associated with either the April 2021 claim for service connection for a low back disability or the March 2022 claim for an increased rating for a lumbar strain, as neither of those claims encompassed a claim for entitlement to service connection for lower extremity radiculopathy, as discussed above.   

On April 17, 2023, the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim. As of March 24, 2015, a claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received. In September 2023, within a year of the intent to file, the Veteran submitted a claim for an increased rating of IVDS. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA back examination in October 2023, and the examiner determined that the Veteran had a diagnosis of bilateral radiculopathy of the lower extremities related to his IVDS. As such, the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was raised as part and parcel of the April 17, 2023 claim for an increased rating for IVDS. Therefore, the Board finds that the date of receipt of the claim for entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was April 17, 2023, the date of receipt of the intent to file a claim, which represents the earliest available effective date for the grant of service connection. 

Concerning the left lower extremity radiculopathy, the medical records do not show any diagnosis of left lower extremity radiculopathy or indication that the Veteran had symptoms of left lower extremity radiculopathy until the MRI performed on September 7, 2023. The MRI showed that the Veteran had degenerative changes of the lumbar spine causing a disc bulge at L5-S1 where it could be in a position to pinch the nerve as it exits the spinal canal on the left side. This can cause radiating pain, numbness or tingling in the leg on the affected side. 

Therefore, the Board finds that September 7, 2023 is the date that entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy arose. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). As such, the Board finds that September 7, 2023 is the appropriate effective date for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy. 

Regarding the right lower extremity radiculopathy, a January 2023 VA medical note reveals that the Veteran had tingling and numbness going down to the calf on the right side. Therefore, the medical evidence shows that the Veteran was experiencing right lower extremity radiculopathy symptoms prior to receipt of the April 17, 2023 intent to file. As such, the Board finds that the date of receipt of claim, April 17, 2023, is the appropriate effective date for the grant of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy. See Id.

Accordingly, entitlement to an effective date of September 7, 2023 for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy, and an effective date of April 17, 2023 for the grant of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, is granted.
