DOCKET NO. 241226-503468
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to payment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) beneficiary travel expenses related to travel to the Veteran's VA medical appointments from February 16, 2024, to October 4, 2024, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The issue the Veteran seeks to appeal was not adjudicated by the AOJ and there is no appeal before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  As such, there is no case or controversy for the Board to adjudicate.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to payment of VA beneficiary travel expenses related to travel to the Veteran's VA medical appointments from February 16, 2024, to October 4, 2024, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from July 1966 to March 1970.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 notification letter from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In December 2024, the Veteran disagreed with the abovementioned notification letter and filed a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)).  The Veteran selected the Evidence Review Lane under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d).  Accordingly, the Board is limited to review of the evidence in the record at the time of the notice for the decision on appeal and the evidence submitted up to 90 days after the Veteran's VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the above claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.   

The Board notes that the Veteran submitted evidence within the 90-day period following his April 2024 December 2024 Notice of Disagreement which precludes a docket switch.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Dismissal

The Board has jurisdiction in all matters where there is a question of law or fact necessary for a decision by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans or their dependents or survivors.  38 U.S.C. § 7104.  The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege a specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

The Veteran seeks payment or reimbursement of travel expenses to his VA appointments from February 16, 2024, to October 4, 2024.  In his December 2024 VA Form 10182 the Veteran noted the date of the decision on appeal was August 23, 2024.  Attached to the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was a letter wherein he noted that the August 23, 2024, notice letter mentioned travel reimbursement on the last page.  However, the Board notes that the August 2024 notice letter was for the Veteran's August 2024 rating decision that adjudicated service connection claims.  The August 2024 rating decision did not address travel benefits.  Further, while the August 2024 notice letter contained boilerplate language for how to appeal a "payment for travel" claim, the letter did not indicate that such a claim had been filed or adjudicated. 

VHA investigated the submitted VA Form 10182 but determined that there was no evidence of a claim filed in the Beneficiary Travel Self Service System (BTSSS), and no active claims found associated with the Veteran's August 2024 VA Form 10182.  See February 2025 Missing Records Memorandum 

A VA Form 10182 is a Notice of Disagreement with a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  38 C.F.R. 20.201.  Here, the evidence persuasively shows that no decision by the AOJ has been made because no claim has been filed.  As a result, there is no allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration in the present appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

As noted above, under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  Here, although a VA Form 10182 was submitted by the Veteran in August 2024, there has been no claim for benefits or adjudication of entitlement to benefits.  There is no case or controversy for the Board to adjudicate, and the appropriate course of action is to dismiss the present appeal.  Cardona v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 472, 474 (2014) (citing Padgett v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 159, 164 (2008) (en banc)).?

Therefore, as there are no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration with regard to the claimed beneficiary travel issue, the Board has no jurisdiction in the instant matter, and the claim is dismissed.
