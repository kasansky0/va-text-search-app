ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss began during active service.

2. The evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus began during active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

2. With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1961 to March 1965.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In that decision, the RO continued to deny service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.

In June 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus most recently addressed in a May 2024 rating decision.  In June 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which although indicating that new and relevant had not been received, readjudicated the claims and denied them based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2025 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

While the Veteran was notified of the AOJ's June 2024 decision on appeal within one year of the issuance of this decision and the opportunity to request a different docket has not fully expired, this decision represents a complete grant of the benefits sought and therefore there is no prejudice to the Veteran in adjudicating the claims on appeal.  Williams vs. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in active military service. 38 U.S.C.§ 1131 ; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service disease or injury; and (3) a relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus

The Veteran asserts that his bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus had onset in service. 

The June 2024 rating decision favorably found that current disabilities of bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus are diagnosed, and that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during your service as the Veteran's DD-214 shows a military occupational specialty (MOS) as a Construction Helper, which has a moderate risk of hazardous noise exposure. Therefore, the current disability requirements and in-service injury requirements are met.

During a May 2023 VA audiological examination, the Veteran reported that he experienced decreased hearing and ringing in his ears in 1962. The VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, and opined that bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus was less likely as not due to service because although the Veteran had an MOS that had moderate probability or hazardous noise exposure, no indications of hearing loss were found in service records. 

A May 2023 VA examiner also opined that bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus were less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity(ies), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. He stated that hearing is due to aging process or louse noise exposure, chronic ear infection, medications, inflammation or trauma and there was no medical evidence to support a finding that hearing loss is associated with TERA. Regarding tinnitus, he stated that ringing in ears can have causes that are not due to underlying disease, such as exposure to loud sounds, whiplash, head injuries, too much ear wax, or medication side effects and there is  no medical evidence to support a finding that tinnitus is associated with TERA.  A September 2023 VA opinion is the same opinion as the May 2023 opinion. 

The May 2023 and September 2023 examiners seemingly based their negative opinions on the "normal" audiology results measured at discharge from service and the lack of documented complaints, treatment, or hearing loss during service. These are inadequate grounds on which to support a negative opinion because the absence of hearing loss disability in service is not in and of itself fatal to a claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss disability. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993). This is consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d), which provides for service connection for a disease first diagnosed after service.

Additionally, although the VA examiners acknowledged that the Veteran had hazardous noise exposure in service, they did not take into account the Veteran's competent and credible reports of continuous bilateral hearing loss symptoms in the years since service, thus rendering the opinion inadequate. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 n. 1 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (noting that VA's examiner's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the veteran's] disability such that his claim for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence").

The Veteran competently and credibly reported that he experienced hearing loss symptoms and ringing in his ears since separation from service. To the extent that the grant of service connection in this matter is based primarily on lay evidence, "[i]f the Board concludes that the lay evidence presented by a veteran is credible and ultimately competent, the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence should not be an absolute bar to the veteran's ability to prove his claim of entitlement to disability benefits based on that competent lay evidence." Id. at 1337.

At this point, the Board could remand the claim for a VA opinion. However, a request for an opinion could be construed as obtaining additional evidence for the sole purpose of denying the claim, which is impermissible. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (c) ("The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination"); Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021) ("Remand is inappropriate where the predominant purpose is not to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision unencumbered by error but to allow VA to obtain more evidence so that it can properly deny the claim"). The evidence is sufficient to decide the claim, as it shows onset of hearing loss and tinnitus in service following acoustic trauma.

For the above reasons, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether hearing loss and tinnitus had onset in service following acoustic trauma. As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus are warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
