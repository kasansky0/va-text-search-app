DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

The issue of eligibility for benefits under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) extending from the August 2023 PCAFC application is denied.

The issue of eligibility for benefits under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) extending from the February 2024 PCAFC application is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Due to the death of the Veteran, final approval and designation for PCAFC benefits is unachievable as both the Veteran and the Primary Family Caregiver applicant are precluded from completing and complying with all applicable requirements of the program.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the appeal for eligibility of PCAFC benefits must be denied as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1720G, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 71.10-71.60.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service from August 1967 to August 1970.  His decorations included a Vietnam Service Medal and a Vietnam Campaign Medal. 

As an initial matter, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) thanks the Veteran's daughter for her dedication in the care of the Veteran.  Unfortunately, the Veteran passed away in February 2025.  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran and Caregiver-Applicant elected the Direct Review docket to appeal PCAFC eligibility decisions rendered in November 2023 and April 2024.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, here the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

As a last preliminary matter, the Board acknowledges the recent precedential decision Williams v. McDonough regarding 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) and deciding AMA appeals before the time to change dockets has elapsed.  Williams, No. 21-7363 (U.S. Vet. App. June 21, 2024).  In the present case, as outlined in further detail below, the Board finds that this appeal is being denied as a matter of law.  As such, the availability of a "docket switch" is of no consequence to the outcome of the case.  Under these circumstances, the Board concludes that it may proceed with adjudication without further delay.

The issue of eligibility for benefits under PCAFC.

The Veteran and Primary Caregiver-Applicant (daughter) applied jointly for participation in PCAFC in August 2023 and February 2024.  

Pursuant to the August 2023 application, the Veteran was denied initial eligibility to PCAFC benefits in a November 2023 VHA decision (and filed a supplemental claim in December 2023).  Pursuant to the February 2024 application, the Veteran was denied initial eligibility to PCAFC benefits in an April 2024 VHA decision.  The Veteran appealed both denials via the April 2024 VA Form 10182.  

Sadly, the Veteran died in February 2025, while the appeal for initial eligibility into PCAFC was pending.  Unfortunately, due to the death of the Veteran, the Board must deny this appeal as a matter of law.

PCAFC is a VA program that provides certain benefits to eligible veterans who have incurred or aggravated serious injuries during military service, and to their caregivers.  38 C.F.R. § 71.10(a).  An "eligible veteran" means a veteran, or a servicemember, who is found eligible for a Family Caregiver under 38 C.F.R. § 71.20.  38 C.F.R. § 71.15.  A "Primary Family Caregiver" means an individual who meets the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 71.25.  Id. 

The application requirements under 38 C.F.R. § 71.25 require that, before VA approves an applicant to serve as a Primary or Secondary Family Caregiver, the applicant must: (1) be initially assessed by VA as being able to complete caregiver education and training, and (2) complete caregiver training and demonstrate the ability to carry out the specific personal care services, core competencies, and additional care requirements.  See 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(c).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(f), final approval and designation for the Caregiver Program benefits will be conditioned on the Veteran and Caregiver "remaining eligible" for Caregiver Program benefits, including the Caregiver continuing to provide caregiver services to the Veteran and continuing compliance with all applicable requirements.

Here, the AOJ did not find the Veteran eligible for PCAFC benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 71.20 prior to his death.  See April 2, 2024, VA Notification Letter.  Final approval and designation did not occur by the time of the Veteran's death, so periodic monthly PCAFC benefits had not been established.

In this case, final approval and designation of the PCAFC benefits did not occur by the time of the Veteran's death, the joint application was not processed, and the applicants were not enrolled in PCAFC.  See 80 Fed. Reg. 1375 (January 9, 2015) (Family Caregiver benefits are effective as of the date that the signed joint application is received by VA or the date the eligible veteran begins receiving care at home (whichever is later), but these benefits are not provided until a Family Caregiver has been designated.  Family Caregivers must complete all required training and instruction to become so designated).

Approval for PCAFC and designation of a Primary Family Caregiver are precluded as a matter of law because the eligible Veteran and Family Caregiver are no longer eligible for benefits.  Therefore, there is no basis upon which to award the benefit sought in this case as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (holding that, where the law and not the evidence is dispositive, the Board should deny the claim on the ground of the lack of legal merit or the lack of entitlement under the law).  The Veteran's death precludes initial eligibility.

The Board offers its sincere condolences to the Veteran's family and is grateful for his honorable service; however, the Board is bound by law, and its decision is dictated by the relevant statutes and regulations. 

The Board is mindful that the notification letters sent in this case are not entirely compliant with 38 U.S.C. § 5104 and that a remand may provide additional medical and procedural documents in the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1720(G)(12).  However, the April 2024 denial letter is part of the record and sufficient other documentation to verify that the PCAFC claim was not finally approved prior to the Veteran's death.  As such, there is no basis upon which to award the benefit sought in this case as a matter of law.  Hence, any error is nonprejudicial, and remand for correction of these errors would not have any reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Under these circumstances, there is no potential avenue by which the eligibility requirements for PCAFC benefits could be granted.  Therefore, this appeal must be denied as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.
