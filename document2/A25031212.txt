CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for readjudication of the appellant's claim for entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for a duodenal ulcer have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156 (a); 3.2501.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disorder are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1966 to March 1968. The Veteran died in August 2020. The appellant is his surviving spouse. 

The claims of service connection for GERD and an increased rating for an ulcer were initially on appeal from a June 2018 rating decision in the Legacy appeal system. Following the issuance of a June 2019 statement of the case (SOC), the Veteran submitted a VA Form 9 dated July 2019.  In August 2019, he filed a notice of disagreement (NOD), timely opting into the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system. The Veteran selected the Hearing Lane. 

Unfortunately, the Veteran died in August 2020 during the pendency of the appeal. In September 2020, his surviving wife was substituted as the appellant in the Veteran's appeal. 

In March 2021, the Board issued a decision denying the claim for an increased rating for a duodenal ulcer and remanding the claim of service connection for GERD. 

The AOJ issued a rating decision in December 2022 and denied entitlement to service connection for GERD. 

In August 2023, the appellant filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim and requested review of the prior denials for an increased rating for a duodenal ulcer and service connection for GERD, a respiratory/sinus disorder, and hypertension.

In January 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision, denying her claims. In April 2024, the appellant appealed this decision and filed a VA Form 10182, selecting the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

New and relevant evidence

VA will readjudicate a previously denied claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 U.S.C. § 5108 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d). New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim and includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1).

1. Whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for a duodenal ulcer.

The appellant is seeking readjudication of the previously denied claim for an increased rating for duodenal ulcer. The claim was denied in the March 2021 Board decision because the Board found that the Veteran did not have an ulcer during the rating period on appeal. The procedural history of this claim is outlined above. 

Under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h). For decisions rendered after a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182. Id. For Board decisions, a supplemental claim can be filed or the claimant can file an appeal at the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court). 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(3). (For further explanation, see appellate rights attached below for this decision.)

The term "continuous pursuit" only applies to AMA decisions. Specifically, when a claim filed under AMA is granted in an initial decision, the effective date of an AMA initial decision will be the later of the date of the supplemental claim, or the date of entitlement. Thus, even if a supplemental claim is received within one year of a legacy decision, the date of receipt of the supplemental claim will be considered the date of claim for effective date purposes. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500 (h), 3.2500 (f). The claim is considered finally adjudicated when the expiration of the period in which to file a review option available under Section 3.2500 or disposition on judicial review where no such review option is available. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d)(2). 

For increased ratings, a claimant could file a claim with new and relevant evidence to either show that since the prior decision the disability had increased or worsened or to show that for the prior time period on appeal, the disability was worse than the prior decision showed. However, here, the Veteran died in 2020. So, there is no worsening available to show, instead, the only option is to show that in the prior appeal period the disability was worse than how it was rated. However, the Appellant lost continuous pursuit, because a supplemental claim was not filed within one year after the Board decision and no appeal was taken to the Court. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d)(2).

Here, inexplicably, the AOJ in the January 2024 rating decision stated:  "We reviewed the evidence received and determined your service-connected condition hasn't increased in severity sufficiently to warrant a higher evaluation." This is clearly and unmistakably erroneous since the Veteran died in 2020 and they could not be looking at the prior time period on appeal because the file clearly shows that continuous pursuit was lost. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d)(2). To the extent the AOJ found new and relevant evidence of worsening as a favorable finding, the Board finds that was clearly and unmistakably erroneous as the Veteran died in 2020. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

In the alternative, even if the question for the Board is whether new and relevant evidence was added to the claims file since the March 2021 Board decision, prior to the January 2024 supplemental claim decision on appeal, the answer is negative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Since the March 2021 Board decision, the appellant submitted statements regarding the Veteran's symptoms prior to his death and copies of previously submitted treatment records. This evidence is relevant, but not new, as it was previously of record. The record also contains internet articles regarding toxins in groundwater near various military bases and VA opinions dated in March 2021 and September 2022, regarding the etiology of the Veteran's claimed GERD. This evidence is new, but not relevant as it does not tend to prove or disprove the appellant's claim for an increased rating for a duodenal ulcer. New and relevant evidence has not been received. Regardless of the path, readjudication of the claim for an increased rating for a duodenal ulcer is not warranted.

Service connection claims

Claims of service connection for GERD, hypertension, and a respiratory condition were previously denied in October 2008 and December 2022 rating decisions. Under the modernized review system, new and relevant evidence is necessary to readjudicate a claim. While the AOJ did not explicitly adjudicate if new and relevant evidence had been received, the Board may infer that new and relevant evidence was sufficiently submitted since the AOJ readjudicated the claims on the merits. Favorable findings identified by the AOJ in its previous rating decisions related to this claim are binding on the Board, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R.§ 3.104 (c).

Service connection will be granted if it is shown that a veteran has a disability resulting from an injury or disease contracted in the line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury or disease contracted in the line of duty in the active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). 

Generally, to establish service connection, a veteran must show: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167. All elements must be satisfied before service connection may be achieved. Additionally, service connection may be achieved if any applicable presumptive service connection regulations apply to the Veteran's circumstances or when a claimed disability is shown to be proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disability.

2. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension 

Service treatment records show no symptoms, diagnosis, or treatment for hypertension during service. The Veteran's blood pressure at discharge in January 1968 was 110/68 and a clinical evaluation of all systems was normal. 

Post service treatment records show the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension in June 2017.

In her August 2023 statement, the appellant contended that the Veteran experienced a variety of disorders and diseases as a result of service. The appellant did not specifically identify hypertension as one of those disorders. 

In a November 2923, VA issued a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum, in which it found that the Veteran was not exposed to a TERA during service. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for hypertension is not warranted. Though the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension, the persuasive evidence is against a finding a nexus between his hypertension and service. Rather, he was first diagnosed with hypertension in 2017, 49 years after his discharge from service. See Maxon v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (a prolonged period without medical complaint can be considered, along with other factors, as evidence of whether an injury or a disease was incurred in service resulting in any chronic or persistent disability). Moreover, there is no evidence of hypertension or elevated blood pressure during service or any medical opinion supporting a nexus. 

VA must provide a VA medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) there is insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. Id. See also 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4)(i); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-83 (2006). Here, there is no evidence of an in-service event or any indication of an association between his hypertension and service. Therefore, the claim does not meet the requirements for obtaining a VA medical opinion. Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

The appellant is not otherwise competent to link the Veteran's hypertension to service. Competent lay evidence means any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (where widow seeking service connection for cause of death of her husband, the Veteran, the Court holding that medical opinion not required to prove nexus between service-connected mental disorder and drowning which caused Veteran's death).

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for hypertension is not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

3. Entitlement to service connection for respiratory condition (claimed as sinuses)

Service treatment records show no symptoms, diagnosis, or treatment for a sinus or respiratory disorder in service. At separation, the Veteran noted having "ear, nose, or throat trouble", but the summary showed "ear - tinnitus both ears since basic."  A clinical evaluation of his sinuses and lungs were normal. 

Post service treatment records show no sinusitis in December 2002. Imaging from September 2017 showed the paranasal sinuses were clear and well aerated. In July 2019, the Veteran's visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.

In her August 2023 statement, the appellant contended that the Veteran experienced a variety of disorders and diseases as a result of service. The appellant did not specifically identify a respiratory disorder or sinusitis as one of those disorders. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran had a respiratory or sinus disorder prior to his death. The record contains private primary care treatment records from February 2018 to January 2022 and VA primary care treatment records thereafter. None of the Veteran's treatment records reflect any sinus diagnosis or symptoms, and his September 2017 and July 2019 imaging shows affirmative evidence that his sinuses were clear. Moreover, the appellant has not presented competent and credible evidence of a sinus disability or functional impairment of earning capacity from sinus symptoms during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). 

Where the evidence does not support a finding of current disability upon which to predicate a grant of service connection, there can be no valid claim for that benefit. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013). As the evidence does not establish a current disability, VA has no duty to provide an examination, and remand to cure pre-decisional duty to assist error is therefore not warranted. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 81; see 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i). For these reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of a sinus disability and service connection must therefore be denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded. 

The issue of entitlement to service connection for GERD is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the January 2024 rating decision on appeal.  The AOJ obtained multiple VA medical opinions; however, these medical opinion does not provide an adequate rationale regarding whether the Veteran's GERD was caused or aggravated by the service-connected duodenal ulcer.

Service treatment records show that the Veteran reported stomach pain, including burning, aching, and excessive gas in March 1967, August 1967, and December 1967. An upper GI series revealed a scarred duodenal bulb, consistent with previous ulcer disease but no acute ulcer was demonstrated. He was diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer. In the Veteran's January 1968 report of medical history at separation, he reported that he was "good except stomach trouble." He endorsed having or ever having had stomach, liver, or intestinal trouble. The summary showed the Veteran had a permanent profile for a duodenal ulcer. 

Post service treatment records show the Veteran was diagnosed with GERD in September 2007.        

Regarding a nexus, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for GERD in June 2018.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's GERD was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the duodenal ulcer because GERD and a duodenal ulcer are two different conditions, and one does not cause the other. 

In a March 2021 VA opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's GERD is less likely than not the result of or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected duodenal ulcer. The examiner provided the following rationale:

"GERD and duodenal ulcer are two different medical conditions. One does not cause other. Pathophysiology is different.    

In Gastroesophageal reflux disease, antireflux barrier at the gastroesophageal junction is anatomically and physiologically complex and vulnerable to several    potential mechanisms of reflux.    

Veteran had normal stomach by upper GI series done on March 15, 1967."

In a September 2022 VA opinion, the examiner added the following:

"Etiology for GERD is multifactorial. Spicy foods, dietary habits, alcohol, mental stress etc. can increase acid secretion and shows various effects at esophageal junction."

Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. § 1110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a). Under the causation standard of section 1110 of Title 38 of the United States Code, secondary service connection is warranted where a nonservice-connected disability would have been less severe "but-for" a service connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability. Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

The Board finds the VA opinions to be inadequate in three respects. First, regarding direct service connection, the VA examiner did not opine whether the Veteran's in-service symptoms were related to his post-service diagnosis of GERD.

Regarding secondary service connection, the opinion rendered does not use the appropriate evidentiary standard. See Spicer, 61 F.4th at 1364-66 (invalidating the requirement of "proximate cause" and instead holding "but for" causation or aggravation is enough to show entitlement to secondary service connection). Therefore, a new opinion is necessary using the appropriate standard. 

Finally, no opinion has been offered regarding aggravation. 

For these reasons, an addendum opinion is required on remand.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from a VA examiner of appropriate expertise to ascertain the etiology of the Veteran's GERD. (As the Veteran died in 2020, additional examinations are not possible.) The claims file should be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner. The examiner should address the following:

(a.) Whether the Veteran's GERD began in or is otherwise the result of military service.

(b.) Whether, but for the Veteran's service-connected duodenal ulcer, he would not have had a GERD.

(c.) Whether the Veteran's GERD would be less severe and result in less functional impairment but for the Veteran's service-connected duodenal ulcer.

(d.) If the examiner opines that the GERD would result in less functional impairment but for the service-connected disabilities, the examiner must attempt to establish a baseline level of severity of the diagnosed disability prior to aggravation by the primary service-connected disability.

?

2. The examiner should provide a detailed rationale for the opinion, including a discussion of the evidence of record and medical principles which led to the conclusions reached. If an opinion cannot be provided without resort to speculation, the examiner should explain why it is not possible to provide an opinion.
