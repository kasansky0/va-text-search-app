ORDER

Eligibility to attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in a November 2023 rating decision is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's April 2012 appointment of the appellant as his attorney and the associated fee agreement are valid.

2. In a November 2023 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for radiculopathy, left and right lower extremity, femoral nerve, with an evaluation of 20 percent, respectively, effective January 6, 2023; granted Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) established based on permanent and total disability status, from January 6, 2023, from which the past-due benefits awarded are contested.  In that same decision, 20 percent evaluations for radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremity, sciatic nerve, was continued. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in the November 2023 rating decision have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from March 1996 to March 2000.      

The appellant, J. Michael Woods, is the Veteran's former attorney. See Attorney Revocation Letter dated September 2024.

The case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 Summary of the Case (fee decision).

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 fee decision on appeal, and a brief or argument filed by the party who did not file the NOD if received within 30 days of the notice of the content of the NOD. 38?C.F.R. §§?20.400-20.405.  If evidence was added to the record during an ineligible period identified above, the Board has not considered that evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. 

The record reflects both the Veteran and appellant were mailed copies of the AMA Initial and Final Notification Letters dated January 2024 and April 2024.

Issue: Whether the appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a November 2023 rating decision. 

Legal Criteria

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904. 

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA.  The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney, and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a).  A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time.  Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1). 

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.  To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined.  Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits.  A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within 30 days of its execution.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).  Fee agreements must be reasonable; those which do not exceed 20 percent of past-due benefits are presumed reasonable.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f).

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1); see also Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28, 32-34 (2023).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case. This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1).

In Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (Federal Circuit) held that agents and attorneys are eligible to receive fees pursuant to supplemental claims filed more than one year after a decision has been under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (b), and thereby invalidating the regulatory provision of 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(c)(1)(i). 7 F.4th 1110, 1135-41 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The Federal Circuit explained that while § 5104C(b) supplemental claims may have a different effective date and duty to notify than § 5104C(a) supplemental claims, see §§ 5110(a)(3), 5103(a)(3), such distinctions should matter in the context of charging attorneys' fees. Id. at 1139.  The Court expressly rejected the government's argument that a § 5104C(b) supplemental claim filed more than a year after a prior decision is not part of the same "case" as that earlier decision, thereby barring attorneys from charging fees for any work on such claims until the supplemental claim itself is rejected. Id. at 1138.

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2). 

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

Analysis

As explained below, the Board finds that the appellant is eligible to attorney fees from the past-due benefits awarded in the November 2023 rating decision.

In April 2012, the Veteran executed a VA Form 21-22a on which he appointed the appellant as his attorney.  The parties executed a fee agreement which provided that the appellant was entitled to fees of 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran, and that the fee was to be paid directly to the appellant by VA.  The Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his attorney and the associated fee agreement are valid. 

By way of history, in a February 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted, among others, service connection for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, sciatic nerve, with a 20 percent evaluation, effective November 15, 2021; in that same decision, the evaluation for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity was decreased from 60 percent to 20 percent disabling, effective May 1, 2022. 

In January 2023, the Veteran, through his attorney, submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested review of the February 2022 rating decision, in particular, evaluations of radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities, sciatic nerve. 

By a November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for radiculopathy, left and right lower extremity, femoral nerve, with an evaluation of 20 percent, respectively, effective January 6, 2023; and found DEA established based on permanent and total disability status, from January 6, 2023, from which the past-due benefits awarded are contested.  In that same decision, the 20 percent evaluation for radiculopathy, bilateral lower extremity, sciatic nerve, was continued. 

In a November 2023 fee decision, the decision on appeal, the AOJ denied fees because there was no qualifying request to review the November 2023 rating decision.  

In January 2024, the appellant timely appealed seeking attorney fees from the grant of left and right lower extremity radiculopathy femoral nerve. See VA Form 10182.  

Here, the Board finds the appellant eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the November 2023 rating decision.   

Initially, the Veteran's April 2012 appointment of the appellant as his attorney, and the associated fee agreement, are valid.  

Next, the February 2022 rating decision which continued the evaluations for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities, constituted the initial decision on the issues.  

A supplemental claim was subsequently filed in January 2023 pertaining to the issues of increased evaluation for radiculopathy of the lower extremities, and representation took place after issuance of notice of an initial decision, which essentially resulted in the subsequent grant issued in the November 2023 rating decision.  An attorney may charge fees for representation provided after the initial decision on an issue.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1); see also Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024) (representatives may receive fees for aiding claimants with continuous pursuit of claim or disability rating assigned from supplemental claim).  

Thus, the November 2023 rating decision that granted separate ratings for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities, femoral nerve, was not the initial decision on the claim.
