DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

An initial compensable rating for hypertension is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hypertension does not result in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and requiring continuous medication for control.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from June 1968 to August 1972.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

An initial compensable rating for hypertension is denied.

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for his service-connected hypertension. 

Disability evaluations are based upon the average impairment of earning capacity as contemplated by the schedule for rating disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). In adjudicating increased rating claims, the level of disability in all periods since the effective date of the grant of service connection must be taken into account, to include the possibility that a staged rating may be assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). As such, the Board will consider whether staged ratings are appropriate to the pending appeals. In cases in which a reasonable doubt arises as to the appropriate degree of disability to be assigned, such doubt shall be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Veteran's hypertension is rated as noncompensable under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101. Under this code, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. A 40 percent disability rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more warrants a 40 percent rating. A maximum schedular 60 percent disability rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101. In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent rating for a diagnostic code, a zero percent rating shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria. Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common." See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

The Veteran underwent a VA hypertension examination in June 2023. The claims file was reviewed by the examiner, and a current diagnosis of hypertension was confirmed. The Veteran was noted to use medication to control his hypertension. The examiner took three blood pressure readings and noted a maximum systolic pressure of 145 and a maximum diastolic pressure of 86. The examiner concluded, based on review of the claims file and pertinent medical history, that the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic pressure above 100.

The claims file also contains private and VA outpatient treatment records. These do not, however, reflect a history of diastolic pressure readings above 100. 

Thus, the Board concludes the evidence is persuasively against a compensable rating for the Veteran's hypertension, as a history of diastolic pressure above 100 has not been established. Therefore, while the Veteran has a confirmed diagnosis of hypertension, and has required medication for this disability, the totality of the record is against finding a history of diastolic pressure predominantly at or above 100. In order to warrant a compensable rating for service-connected hypertension, the Veteran would have to demonstrate both continuous medication for control of hypertension and a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more. As such a history has not been established, a compensable rating is not warranted.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has been taking medication for his hypertension, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that VA may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). However, the Court subsequently determined that for hypertension, the plain language of DC 7101 contemplates the effects of medication and, thus, the Jones case is not applicable to cases involving hypertension. McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271-73 (2016). That is, the rating criteria for hypertension already considers the ameliorative effects of medication. Id.

Therefore, as there is no basis for a compensable rating for hypertension, the Veteran's claim must be denied. As the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107.
