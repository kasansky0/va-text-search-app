ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Tinnitus has been shown to have originated in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from December 1987 to July 1990.

In September 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for tinnitus.  In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Service Connection for Tinnitus.

The Veteran asserts that service connection for tinnitus is warranted as the claimed disability was manifested as the result of her in service noise exposure. 

Service connection may be established for recurrent disability arising from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service treatment records do not refer to tinnitus or ringing of the ears.  The personnel records convey that the Veteran served in the Army and her military occupational specialty was an administrative specialist.  

In a February 2024 written statement, the Veteran conveyed that she was exposed to loud noises including grenade and weapons fire and vehicle noise.  

In the September 2024 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction made a favorable finding that the Veteran had "hazardous noise exposure."  

The report of a December 2022 audiological examination conducted for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) states that the Veteran reported the onset of tinnitus "during basic training with grenades" and continuance of the disability to the present time. The Veteran was diagnosed with tinnitus.  

A February 2024 evaluation from R. Broadnax, D.N.P., R.N., states that the Veteran's records had been reviewed.  Ms. Brodnax concluded that "[i]t is more likely than not that the Veteran's development of tinnitus can be attributed to their exposure to high decibel sounds during basic training" and "the medical literature supports such a nexus."

The record is in at least equipoise as to whether the diagnosed tinnitus originated during active service.  The Veteran's in service hazard noise exposure has been conceded by VA.  The Veteran has reported the in service onset of tinnitus associated with grenade explosion related noise exposure.  She has been diagnosed with tinnitus by VA and private examiners. Ms. Brodnax concluded that the diagnosed tinnitus was related to the Veteran's conceded in service hazardous noise exposure.  Upon resolution of all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
