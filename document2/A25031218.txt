CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in the October 2023 rating decision are met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from July 1974 to April 1975.

The Appellant is the Veteran's attorney representative, except that he does not represent the Veteran in this contested claim for attorney's fees.  See January 12, 2024 and March 8, 2024 letters (advising the Veteran the Appellant will not be able to represent him in this matter and indicating he may appoint a new representative or represent himself). 

The fee decision on appeal was issued on November 3, 2023 and constitutes an initial decision of the issue of fees warranted from the October 27, 2023 rating decision.  In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  The Veteran did not elect to change the docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 3, 2023 fee decision on appeal, any brief or argument filed by the Veteran if received within 30 days of the January 12, 2024, notice of the substance of the NOD.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.404, 20.405.

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904.

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22, "Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative," or VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative," is required to represent a claimant before VA.  The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a).  A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time.  Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1).

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.  A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case.  This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1).  Agents and attorneys may charge fees for representation provided with respect to a request for revision of a decision of an AOJ or the Board based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) if notice of the challenged decision on a claim or claims was issued on or after the effective date of the modernized review system, and the agent or attorney has complied with the power of attorney requirements in 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 and the fee agreement requirements in 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(c)(1).

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).  

Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded shall be presumed to be reasonable if the agent or attorney provided representation that continued through the date of the decision awarding benefits.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f)(1).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  The fees are payable to the attorney based on the past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020).

A supplemental claim filed more than a year after the initial rating decision is part of the original case, and an attorney may charge fees for representation provided in filing that supplemental claim.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110, 1138-1141 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In Chisholm v. Collins, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that "because the veteran is seeking higher ratings for his service-connected disabilities by applying for TDIU, that application can serve as a supplemental claim when filed after VA denies higher ratings for those disabilities" when it is filed before the prior rating decision becomes final.  No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, at *2 (Vet. App. Mar. 13, 2025).

On July 8, 2021 the Veteran and Appellant executed a VA Form 21-22a appointing the Appellant as his representative.  That same day, the parties also executed a fee agreement, which provided the Appellant was entitled to 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran.  

First, the Board finds that based on the evidence of record, the fee agreement between the Veteran and the Appellant is valid per the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).  In the present case, the written fee agreement was signed by both the Veteran and the Appellant in March 2021, and was received by VA within the 30-day requirement.  It includes the Veteran's name, his VA file number, states the Appellant is entitled to 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran, and that the fee is to be paid directly by VA from any past-due benefits awarded.  Accordingly, the Board finds the fee agreement is valid.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).

Turning to the procedural history of the claims, a March 2023 rating decision confirmed and continued a 20 percent evaluation for painful facial scars. 

In July 2023, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 21-8940 asserting the Veteran was unable to secure or follow gainful employment as a result of inter alia his painful facial scars. 

An October 2023 rating decision granted a 30 percent evaluation for painful facial scars and entitlement to a TDIU, effective July 11, 2023.  Regarding the cause of the Veteran's unemployability, the decision stated he was "unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of your service-connected painful facial scars."

As noted above, a VA Form 21-8940 "can serve as a supplemental claim when filed after VA denies higher ratings" for the cited disability or disabilities previously adjudicated in a rating decision in the one-year prior to receipt of the TDIU application.  Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, at *2-3 (Vet. App. Mar. 13, 2025).  In so finding, the Court stated "[t]he veteran's TDIU request was also a request for the same or similar benefits-higher ratings. . .thereby making the request a supplemental claim following VA's denial of those ratings" in the one-year prior.  Id. at 16.  Considering the holding of Chisholm, the Board must find the July 2023 VA Form 21-8940 was a supplemental claim with the evaluation assigned for the Veteran's painful facial scars in the March 2023 rating decision.  Additionally, the Veteran's TDIU claim was part and parcel of his supplemental claim for his facial scars.  Id. at 11 (stating a "'claim may morph and expand as an appeal, to include TDIU' and be eligible for fees when it is 'continuously pursued and never final'").

Consequently, because the October 2023 rating decision was triggered by the July 2023 VA Form 21-8940, which must be considered a supplemental claim, that rating decision was not the initial decision with respect to the issues favorably decided.  Therefore, the Appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the October 2023 rating decision, and the appeal is granted.
