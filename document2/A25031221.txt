ORDER

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of February 20, 2023, for total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU), is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The most probative evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities precluded the Veteran from substantially gainful employment as of February 20, 2023.

2. The Veteran does not meet the statutory criteria for housebound status and is not housebound in fact.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for TDIU effective February 20, 2023, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

2. The criteria for entitlement to SMC based on being housebound have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.352.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2010 to December 2013. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) and elected direct review. 

Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issues on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301. The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The appellant has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of February 20, 2023, for total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU), is granted. 

The Veteran has been awarded TDIU effective June 2, 2023, the date of submission of a VA Form 21-8940. In argument submitted with the NOD, the Veteran contends entitlement to TDIU effective February 20, 2023, the date of a claim for PTSD. 

In order to establish entitlement to TDIU due to service-connected disabilities, there must be impairment so severe that it is impossible for the average person to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. In reaching that determination, the central inquiry is whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability. Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524 (1993). Consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to the Veteran's age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).

Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and that, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

The effective date of an increased rating claim, which also applies to TDIU, is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless it is factually ascertainable that an increase occurred during the one-year period prior to the filing of a non-initial increased rating claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010). When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the record is closely scrutinized to determine whether the Veteran or the Veteran's representative has contended that the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities at issue have impacted his employability. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) (inferred TDIU claims are part and parcel of underlying increased rating claim). 

The Board notes that the Veteran met the schedular criteria effective February 20, 2023. As of that date, the Veteran had a 70 percent rating for depression, a 50 percent rating for bilateral pes planus, and a 10 percent rating for hallux valgus of each foot.  

On February 20, 2023, the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for PTSD and foot pain. 

In the Veteran's February 2023 medical records, the Veteran reported having looked for work since returning from Germany in January; the Veteran's reported field of work was graphic design and photography. See CAPRI of February 21, 2023.

In February 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA exam regarding feet. The examiner noted the diagnosed foot conditions caused no functional impact. 

In March 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA exam regarding claimed PTSD. The examiner noted the Veteran had a pre-service diagnosis of depressive disorder and that did not meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis. The examiner noted the Veteran had been hospitalized in October 2022 due to a suicide attempt. The examiner opined that the Veteran's depression symptoms would result in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. Symptoms included depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks, mild memory loss, flattened affect, disturbance in motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining relationships, obsessional rituals, and suicidal ideation. 

In March 2023, the Veteran was service connected and received the current ratings for depression, bilateral pes planus, and hallux valgus of each foot.  

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940 for TDIU. The Veteran's most recent employment was reported as Door Dash. The Veteran also reported being evicted in November 22, having to live for a time with a friend in Munich, Germany, and reported currently living with an uncle. In July 2023, the VA received a letter from Door Dash confirming that the Veteran was last employed by them on July 18, 2022. 

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a lay statement from a friend. They met online in the mid-2010s and since 2016 it has been a tradition for the Veteran to stay at the friend's house for a few weeks each year. The friend observed that the Veteran struggles with depression which causes a spiral of social isolation and social skills deteriorating further. 

In July 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA exam regarding depression. The examiner opined that the Veteran's depressed mood, chronic sleep disturbance, memory and concentration, panic attacks, irritability and suspiciousness are likely to hinder the Veteran's ability to attend work on a regular basis, complete a full workday on a consistent basis, or to develop and maintain effective work relationships. Based on that exam, in the rating decision at issue the Veteran's rating for depression was continued at 70 percent and the Veteran was awarded TDIU.

The Board finds that the evidence, to include the VA examination reports, medical records, as well as the lay evidence, support a finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities precluded the Veteran from securing and maintaining substantially gainful employment effective February 20, 2023. 

Entitlement to Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) based on housebound status is denied. 

In the Veteran's NOD and argument submitted by the Veteran's representative, they contend entitlement to SMC(s) based on housebound status. 

The Board should consider entitlement to SMC as an inferred claim when there is an increased rating issue on appeal and the record shows loss of functioning body parts, senses, or organs; loss or loss of use of the extremities; loss or loss of use of creative organs; extreme disruptions in sight, hearing, or speaking; inability to care for oneself; or a 100 percent rating (or TDIU based on a single disability) plus additional disability rating. See Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991); 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2).

The special monthly compensation provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(s) is payable where the veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and, (1) Has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) Is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. This requirement, referred to as housebound in fact, is met when the veteran is substantially confined as a direct result of service-connected disabilities to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or, if institutionalized, to the ward or clinical areas, and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime.

The Veteran does not meet the statutory requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). Per the AOJ, the Veteran's TDIU is based solely on depression; TDIU for a sole condition meets the "100 percent rating" requirement. See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008). However, the Veteran must also have separate disabilities that involve separate and distinct anatomical segments or body systems and be independently ratable at 60 percent. 

While the Veteran has a 50 percent rating for bilateral pes planus and a 10 percent rating for hallux valgus of each foot, these other rated disabilities affect a single body system. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. 3.350. Therefore, the Veteran does not meet the statutory requirements of being housebound.

Additionally, the Veteran is not housebound in fact. While the Veteran does voluntarily self-isolate due to depression, the Veteran attended the listed VA exams in person. The Veteran routinely travels to Europe to stay with a close friend and has indicated a desire to relocate, including to New York City or Europe. There is no indication in the record that the Veteran is substantially confined as a direct result of service-connected disabilities to the Veteran's dwelling and the immediate premises and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities.

As the Veteran does not meet the statutory criteria for housebound status and is not housebound in fact, entitlement to Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) based on housebound status is denied.
