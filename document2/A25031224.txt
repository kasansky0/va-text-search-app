ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a back disorder is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee sprain is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee sprain is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for arthritis is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder, claimed as athlete's foot, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record does not show the Veteran has a current back disability during any time during the appeal period or within close proximity thereto.

2. The evidence of record does not show the Veteran has a current right knee disability during the appeal period or within close proximity thereto.

3. The evidence of record does not show the Veteran has a current left knee disability during the appeal period or within close proximity thereto.

4. The evidence of record does not show the Veteran has a diagnosis of arthritis during the appeal period or within close proximity thereto.

5. The evidence of record persuasively supports that the Veteran's athlete's foot condition was not incurred in or otherwise related to active-duty service, and therefore there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army National Guard from January 2001 to June 2007.  The Veteran served on active duty from January 2002 to June 2002.

The issues on appeal come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In August 2023 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2023 decision.  In November 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior decision.

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be warranted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Additionally, certain chronic diseases, including arthritis, may be presumed to have been incurred during service if the disorder becomes manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation from active duty.  38?U.S.C. §§?1101, 1112, 1113; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.307, 3.309(a).  Alternatively, for chronic diseases shown in service, the third element of service connection may be established through demonstrating chronicity or continuity of symptomatology in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In the context of the National Guard, active military service is defined to include any period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) in which the individual was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; and any period of inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA) during which the individual was disabled by an injury that was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty or from an acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or cerebrovascular accident occurring during such training.  38 U.S.C. § 101(24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a).

Service connection may be awarded for active military service found to occur during ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA.  However, the advantages of certain evidentiary presumptions, such as the presumption of service incurrence for certain chronic diseases, do not extend to those who claim service connection based on a period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA.  Paulson v. Brown,7 Vet. App. 466, 470-71 (1995).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a back disorder and bilateral knee disorders

The Veteran contends that he suffers from a back disability and bilateral knee disorders related to active service.  In the November 2022 claim for compensation, the Veteran stated that he hurt his knees and back during exercises, including 10-mile hikes with heavy equipment, sit ups, and climbing in and out of foxholes.  The Veteran also contends that his knee conditions are the result of working on military vehicles while in service.

In the present case, the Board finds the criteria for the grant of service connection for the Veteran's claimed back disability and bilateral knee disorders have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The evidence of record does not establish the Veteran has had a back disability or bilateral knee disorders at any point during the pendency of the Veteran's appeal.

The threshold requirement for service connection is competent evidence of the existence of the claimed disability shown during the pendency of a veteran's claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

The Veteran's post-service VA and private medical records for the period on appeal are absent of any treatment for the Veteran's claimed back or bilateral knee disorders.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay statement provided in the November 2022 claim for compensation benefits, which reported that the Veteran hurt his knees and back during exercises and while working on military vehicles.  Here, however, the Board notes that the Veteran has not submitted evidence showing a diagnosed back or bilateral knee condition, or claimed symptoms associated with a current condition during the pendency of the Veteran's appeal.  During the period on review, the record is absent of any evidence providing a diagnosis of a back or bilateral knee condition.  Further, the record does not include evidence showing or noting symptoms associated with the Veteran's knees or back.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38?U.S.C. §?1110; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  However, the Board notes that a lack of a formal diagnosis is not dispositive.  The term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability."  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Accordingly, the Board must consider the Veteran's claimed symptoms and the functional impairment of earning capacity resulting from the Veteran's claimed conditions.

Again, the Board notes the Veteran's medical history is absent of complaints or treatment for symptoms of back or knee disorders.

The Board notes the Veteran has not received a VA examination addressing the Veteran's general claim of a knee sprain or back condition.

VA's duty to assist includes providing an examination and obtaining a medical opinion when such an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  Such development is necessary if the information and evidence of record does not contain sufficient competent medical evidence to decide the claim, but (1) contains competent evidence of a diagnosed disability or symptoms of disability, (2) establishes that the Veteran suffered an event, injury or disease in service, or has a presumptive disease during the pertinent presumptive period, and (3) indicates that the claimed disability may be associated with the in-service event, injury, or disease, or with another service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83-86 (2006).  The threshold for finding a link between a current disability and service so as to require medical examination is low.  Locklear v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 410 (2006).

As indicated above, the record is absent of evidence of the Veteran's claimed back or knee disabilities during the period on review prior to the May 2023 rating decision.  Accordingly, the criteria to require a VA medical examination has not been met.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon, supra.  While the threshold for finding a link between a current disability and service so as to require a medical examination is low, the Board finds the record does not contain competent medical evidence of a current disability; nor did the Veteran provide lay evidence related generally to observable symptomatology of a knee or back disability.  Therefore, VA's pre-decisional duty to provide a medical examination addressing the etiology of the Veteran's condition did not attach.  See McLendon, supra; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).

Thus, in light of the above, the evidence of record does not show the Veteran has a current disability for the purposes of VA compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1110.  See Saunders, supra.  In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer, 3?Vet. App.?at 225.  The Board concludes that, as the evidence persuasively weighs against a grant of service connection for the Veteran's claimed back disability and bilateral knee disabilities, it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to service connection for arthritis

The Veteran contends that he suffers from arthritis, which the Veteran reported noticing towards the end of his military career.

The evidence of record does not establish the Veteran suffered from arthritis at any point during the pendency of the Veteran's appeal.

The threshold requirement for service connection is competent evidence of the existence of the claimed disability shown during the pendency of a veteran's claim.  Brammer, supra.

The Veteran's post-service VA and private medical records for the period on appeal are absent of any general treatment for arthritis.  Further, the evidence of record is absent of any reported symptoms that may be interpreted to be associated with arthritis or any part of the Veteran's body.

The Board notes the Veteran has not received a VA examination addressing the Veteran's general claim of arthritis.  In the present case, the record does not include any evidence of a current arthritis diagnosis or symptoms associated with arthritis.  Further, while the Veteran has submitted a lay statement stating that he noticed arthritis towards the end of his military career, arthritis may only be established by x-ray findings, and the Veteran has not shown the proper medical experience or training to provide a probative medical opinion regarding a general diagnosis of arthritis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003; see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Accordingly, the criteria to require a VA medical examination has not been met.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon, supra.

In summary, the evidence of record does not show the Veteran has a current disability for the purposes of VA compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1110.  In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Boyer, 210 F.3d at 1353; Brammer, 3?Vet. App.?at 225.  The Board concludes that, as the evidence persuasively weighs against a grant of service connection for the Veteran's claimed arthritis it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch, supra.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder, claimed as athlete's foot

The Veteran contends that he suffers from athlete's foot which occurred in service due to wearing boots on hot days for long hours at a time.

A review of the Veteran's private medical treatment records shows, in June 2021 the Veteran sought treatment for a complaint of toenail problems.  The private podiatrist noted the Veteran presented as a new patient complaining of left great toenail pain.  The Veteran complained of a toenail problem for three years since stubbing his toe getting off a ladder.

In April 2023, the AOJ provided the Veteran a VA skin conditions examination.  The VA clinician provided the Veteran a diagnosis of tinea pedis and s/p avulsion, nail plate, removal of nail plate.  The Veteran reported that he had an injury to his toe during service around 2005.  The Veteran reported receiving treatment including traumatic removal of the toenail.  He noted his nail never came in correctly after the injury.  The Veteran reported receiving medication for toenail fungus.  The Veteran reported continued symptoms including pain for his left great toenail.

During the examination, the Veteran reported that he currently wore protective boots at work.

The examiner noted that the Veteran was found to have mild tinea pedis upon examination.

The VA examiner noted the Veteran's exposure to fuels and vehicle exhaust during active service; and provided the medical opinion that the Veteran's claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities.

The VA examiner stated tinea pedis is an overgrowth of fungus on the skin which is less likely than not due to exposure (noted as fuels and vehicle exhaust) as a wheeled vehicle mechanic during military service; and is more likely due to the requirement to wear boots for work.  The VA examiner noted closed toe shoes creates an environment that predisposes a person to tinea pedis infection.

Following a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds the criteria for service connection for the Veteran's claimed athlete's foot has not been met.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303; 3.304.  While the evidence of record shows the Veteran was found to have a current diagnosis of mild tinea pedis during the April 2023 VA examination, the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran's condition was incurred in or otherwise is related to the Veteran's active-duty service.

The Board recognizes the Veteran's lay statement offered during the April 2023 VA examination that noted his toe injury during service in 2005 and resulting nailbed deformity, pain, and redness.  Notably, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's reports that his treatment for his left great toe required antifungal medication.  As a lay person the Veteran is competent to report (1) symptoms observable to a layperson, e.g., diminished hearing; (2) a diagnosis that is later confirmed by clinical findings; or (3) a contemporary diagnosis.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  Specifically, the Board will consider the Veteran's lay reports of antifungal treatment following his 2005 toenail injury, as well as the Veteran's November 2022 contention that he developed his present athlete's foot condition wearing military boots on hot days for long hours at a time which caused moisture to build up inside his boots.

The Veteran's service treatment records do not reveal a diagnosis of tinea pedis or athlete's foot during the Veteran's active-duty service.  The Veteran's September 2005 Post-deployment Health Assessment did not show any dermatological concerns.  The Veteran's November 2006 National Guard retention physical examination noted psoriasis of bilateral great toes but revealed normal findings for the Veteran's feet and skin.  The Veteran noted in his November 2006 report of medical history that he did not have a history of foot trouble.  The Veteran reported a history of a face rash after returning from service following Hurricane Katrina, but the condition was noted to be resolved following treatment with medication.

In the present case, the probative evidence of record does not show the Veteran's present diagnosis of tinea pedis was incurred in or related to the Veteran's active-duty service.  There is no evidence of an onset of tinea pedis in service.  Further, the Veteran's June 2021private podiatry record does not show a diagnosis or history of athlete's foot or tinea pedis during the initial patient consultation or during the course of the Veteran's treatment for his left great toenail condition.  The medical evidence of record first shows a diagnosis of tinea pedis in 2023, over 20 years after the Veteran's active-duty service and 16 years from separation from National Guard service.  Thus, the Board assigns little probative value to the Veteran's reported symptoms of athlete's foot and antifungal treatment during his National Guard service, as the Veteran's reports have been not been consistent with reports from contemporaneous records throughout the period on appeal.  See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995); see generally Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59, 68 (1994).

Thus, while the Veteran's April 2023 lay statements indicate treatment involving antifungal medication for his toe condition in 2005, the Veteran's medical history of record does not show a nexus between the Veteran's current tinea pedis and his active service.

The absence of evidence is not substantive negative evidence that a nexus relationship does not exist between the Veteran's current condition and service.  Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 239, n.7 (2012) (citing Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011)).  The Board may weigh a claimant's lay statements against the absence of contemporary medical evidence.  Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272 (2015).  However, the Board must first establish a proper foundation for drawing inferences against a claimant from an absence of documentation.  Horn, 25 Vet. App. at 239.

The Board finds the absence of reported symptoms of tinea pedis during the Veteran's November 2006 National Guard physical examination as evidence weighing against a finding that the Veteran's tinea pedis has existed in service.  As noted above, the Veteran had reported having a face rash after returning from his service during Hurricane Katrina.  Given that the Veteran reported a separate skin disorder, this is evidence that the Veteran did not have tinea pedis, as such a fact would be recorded in the course of the Veteran's medical examination and report of medical history.  Buczynski, 24 Vet. App. at 224.  In addition, in the November 2006 examination, when noting the Veteran's face rash, the examiner specifically wrote there were "no further problems" following the entry which noted the face rash.  Further, the absence of reported symptoms of athlete's foot during the Veteran's June 2021 private podiatry treatment is evidence against the existence of any continuity of symptomatology for tinea pedis since service, as such a fact would be recorded in the initial patient consultation by a private specialist.  Buczynski, 24 Vet. App. at 224.

Moreover, the April 2023 VA examiner provided the medical opinion that the Veteran's current condition was most likely due to the use of the Veteran's footwear for his present job.  The Board notes that the probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical experts' personal examination of the patient, their knowledge, and skill in analyzing the data, and their medical conclusion.

The Board also notes the Veteran's contention that his condition developed from wearing military boots during his service.  Here, the Board recognizes that lay persons are competent to provide medical opinions on some medical issues.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  However, although the Veteran is competent to report his observable symptoms, any opinion regarding whether any skin disability is related to his service requires medical expertise that the Veteran has not demonstrated, as such disabilities can have many causes and may occur at many times throughout the Veteran's life.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376.

Finally, the Board recognizes the overlapping nature of the Veteran's claimed toenail condition, to include s/p avulsion, nail plate, removal of nail plate.  The Veteran identified this disability as a distinct and separate condition from his athlete's foot, and appealed the claim for his toenail condition to the Board on a separate docket.  Notably, in January 2025, the Board provided a decision regarding the Veteran's toenail condition.  Thus, presently the Board has only considered the Veteran's appeal regarding his claim for athlete's foot.

Accordingly, in light of the above, the Board finds the evidence of record does not show the Veteran's tinea pedis was incurred in or was otherwise related to the Veteran's active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The Board concludes that, as the evidence persuasively weighs against granting service connection, it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply.  See Lynch, supra.  Thus, entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder, claimed as athlete's foot, is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
