ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for allergic rhinitis is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for tension headaches for the period from October 25, 2023, to October 9, 2024, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's allergic rhinitis did not have greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides nor complete obstruction on one side.

2. From October 25, 2023, to October 9, 2024, the Veteran experienced tension headaches with less frequent attacks. The Veteran did not exhibit characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months; characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over last several months; or very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial compensable evaluation for allergic rhinitis are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.10, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

2. The criteria for a compensable initial evaluation for tension headaches from October 25, 2023, to October 9, 2024, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 1983 to May 1986; and from March 1993 to January 2005.  The Veteran also had service in the U.S. Army Reserves.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Schedule, but that findings sufficient to identify the disease and the resulting disability and above all, coordination of the rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 and 4.21; see also Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining will be resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Evidence to be considered in the appeal of an initial assignment of a disability rating is not limited to that reflecting the then-current severity of the disorder. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). In cases where a claimant disagrees with an initially assigned disability evaluation it is possible for a veteran to receive a staged rating. That is, it is possible to be awarded separate percentage evaluations for separate periods, based on the facts found during the appeal period. Id. at 126-28; see also Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (in determining the present level of a disability for any increased evaluation claim, the Board must consider staged ratings).

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for allergic rhinitis

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis is currently rated as noncompensable pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 8100.  The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a higher evaluation for the entire period on appeal.

Under DC 6522, when there are no polyps, but there is greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, or complete obstruction on one side, a 10 percent evaluation is merited. Allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps is evaluated as 30 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.

This rating code does not contain provisions for a zero percent evaluation. In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

VA treatment records reveal that the Veteran has a reported medical history of allergic rhinitis.  However, these records are limited to reported history and active problem lists and do not provide any indication as to the severity of the Veteran's allergic rhinitis during these visits. See, for example, a history of allergic rhinitis due to pollen in problem list in October 2022 primary care note. 

In March 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination.  A diagnosis of allergic rhinitis was confirmed.  There was no evidence that there was greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides due to rhinitis.  There was no permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates.  There was no evidence of nasal polyps.  No functional impact was found.

Based on a full review of the evidence of record, the Board finds the March 2024 examination report is adequate because it fully addressed rating criteria, included file review, and is fully responsive to the question at issue. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008). 

The probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran did not have greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides nor complete obstruction on one side at any time during the appeal period. Accordingly, his rhinitis symptoms are not severe enough to warrant a 10 percent evaluation. His claim of a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis must be denied.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to the claim.  Rather, the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for tension headaches from October 25, 2023, to October 9, 2024

The Veteran's tension headache disorder is currently rated as noncompensable for the period from October 25, 2023, to October 9, 2024, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.  The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a higher evaluation for the entire period on appeal.

As a point of clarification with respect to the procedural history of the Veteran's claim, the Board notes that the Veteran has had concurrent appeal streams under the AMA for an increased rating for a tension headache disorder.  Specifically, the Veteran was awarded service connection for a tension headache disorder evaluated as noncompensable effective October 25, 2023, in a March 2024 rating decision.  The Veteran appealed this decision in a May 2024 VA Form 10182, which is the appeal currently before the Board.  The Board notes the legal finding that the Veteran is currently receiving a 30 percent rating from October 9, 2024.

During the pendency of that appeal, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, fully developed claim for an increased rating for his service-connected tension headache disorder in October 2024.  The AOJ accepted this claim and proceeded to issue a February 2025 rating decision granting an increase of the Veteran's service-connected unspecified tension headache disorder to 30 percent, but no higher, and assigned an effective date of October 9, 2024.  The Veteran has not appealed the February 2025 rating decision and this issue is not before the Board.  Consequently, the issue before the Board for adjudication is entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for a tension headache disorder for the period from October 25, 2023, to October 9, 2024. 

Pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for headaches with less frequent attacks than the following criteria for a 10 percent rating. A 10 percent rating is assigned for headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months. A 30 percent rating is available for characteristic prostrating attacks, occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months. A maximum 50 percent rating is warranted for very frequent, completely prostrating and prolonged attacks, productive of severe economic inadaptability.

The rating criteria do not define "prostrating." However, prostration commonly is defined as "complete physical or mental exhaustion." MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S NEW COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY at 999 (11th ed. 2007). "Prostration" has also been defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY at 1523 (30th ed. 2003). Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe headache attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018).

The meaning of the phrase "productive of severe economic inadaptability" also is not defined. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court), however, has issued a precedential decision which focuses on the meaning of this phrase. In Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440 (2004), the Court interpreted the phrase as follows: "nothing in DC 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50% rating" because "[i]f 'economic inadaptability' was read to import unemployability," a claimant who "met the economic-inadaptability criterion, would then be eligible for a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability [(TDIU)]... rather than just a 50% rating." Id. The Court therefore rejected the notion that "severe economic inadaptability" was equivalent to an inability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, the unemployability standard for TDIU benefits. Id. (citing 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a)). In addition, the Court in Pierce acknowledged the Secretary's concession that the phrase "productive of severe economic inadaptability" in DC 8100 should be construed as either "producing" or "capable of producing" severe economic inadaptability. Id. at 445.

VA treatment records reveal that the Veteran has a reported medical history of headaches.  However, these records are limited to reported history and active problem lists and do not provide any indication as to the severity of the Veteran's headaches during these visits. See, for example, a February 2023 primary care note showing a sinus headache and assessment/plan of discussing treatment options nonspecific to headaches. 

In March 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination.  A diagnosis of tension headaches was confirmed.  The Veteran reported that he treats his tension headaches with over the counter and prescription medications.  The Veteran endorsed tension headache symptoms of pain on both sides of the head.  The Veteran denied experiencing non-headache symptoms with headaches.  The Veteran reported that typical head pain lasts less than 1 day, with pain on both sides of the head.  The examiner determined that the Veteran did not have prostrating attacks of headache pain.  Further, the examiner found that the Veteran did not have completely prostrating and prolonged attacks of headache pain.  Also, the examiner found that the Veteran's tension headache disorder did not impact his ability to work. 

Based on a full review of the evidence of record, the Board finds the March 2024 VA examination report is adequate because it fully addressed rating criteria, included file review, and is fully responsive to the question at issue. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 295.

In light of the evidence as discussed above, the Board finds that for the period from October 25, 2023, to October 9, 2024, a compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected tension headache disorder is not warranted. The Veteran's VA treatment records during the review period does not show lay or medical evidence of tension headache prostrating attacks. Moreover, at the time of the March 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported that typical headache pain lasts less than one day.  This is not inconsistent with treatment records.

Although the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms, he has not reported having symptoms such as prostrating attacks that more nearly approximate the criteria for a compensable evaluation during the period on appeal. Similarly, the medical evidence does not show that he has symptoms attributable to tension headaches that are reflective of the criteria for a higher disability evaluation.

As such, the overall evidence of record during this period does not show that the Veteran's tension headaches are productive of prostrating attacks occurring on average, once every two months, over the last several months. 

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to the claim.  Rather, the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.
