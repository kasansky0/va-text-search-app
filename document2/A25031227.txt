ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 14, 2022, for entitlement to TDIU is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACTS

1.	The Veteran's combined evaluation for compensation was rated at 100 percent as of January 19, 2022. 

2.	The Veteran received entitlement to service connection for depressive disorder with depressive features and unspecified anxiety disorder from an August 2022 Rating Decision which granted an effective date of July 14, 2022. 

3.	The evidence of record favors the conclusion that the Veteran's service-connected depressive disorder with depressive features and unspecified anxiety disorder alone rendered the Veteran unable to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment as of July 14, 2022, the date entitlement to service connection was awarded.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of July 14, 2022, for the grant of TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.400, 3.2500(c).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1976 to March 1980. The Veteran had additional service from August 1983 to December 1991 and January 2001 to May 2002 in the United States Air Force.

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Date

The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, but only if the claim for an increase is received within one year from such date. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). Where the increase in disability occurs more than one year prior to the date of claim, the effective date for an award of increased compensation will be the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 980 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015) (holding that the effective date for an increased rating is predicated on when the increase in the disability can be ascertained). The effective date for an increased rating, an initial rating, or for staged ratings depends on when the change in disability level can be ascertained based on all of the evidence of record, and VA should not "mechanically" set effective dates based on the date of an examination. Swain, 27 Vet. App. at 224. Instead, VA must examine all the facts to decide when the disability first manifested or the worsening occurred. See McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000); Swain, supra.)

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 14, 2022, TDIU is denied.

The Veteran contends that his grant of TDIU should be granted an earlier effective date, arguing that he became unemployed due to his service-connected disabilities on June 16, 2016. See January 25, 2024, Veteran Legal Correspondence.

The Veteran filed an application for increased compensation based on unemployability on February 6, 2023. However, when entitlement to TDIU is raised during the adjudicatory process of the underlying disability or during the administrative appeal of the initial rating assigned for that disability, it is part of the claim for benefits for the underlying disability. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 454 (2009). 

Here, the Board finds the issue of entitlement to a TDIU was raised in connection with the Veteran's claim seeking service connection for a mental health condition and with the Veteran's claim seeking entitlement to service connection for left foot, right foot, diabetes, and urinary frequency. See July 14, 2022, Fully Developed Claim. See also January 19, 2022, fully Developed Claim. 

After receiving the Fully Developed Claim on July 14, 2022, seeking entitlement to service connection for mental health condition a rating decision was issued on July 25, 2022. The rating decision granted service connection for bilateral foot injury and left shoulder strain; continued the 10 percent rating for gastroesophageal reflux disease; denied earlier effective dates for chronic sinusitis and nephrolithiasis; and denied service connection for diabetes, urinary frequency, and acute intermittent tension headaches. The mental health conditions issue was deferred. See July 25, 2022, Rating Decision. 

Following the deferment, a rating decision was issued on August 26, 2022, which granted entitlement to service connection for depressive disorder with depressive features and unspecified anxiety with an effective date of July 14, 2022. The Veteran did not challenge the rating and the decision became final. 

The Board also considered that on January 19, 2022, the Veteran filed a Fully Developed Claim seeking entitlement to service connection for left foot, right foot, diabetes, and urinary frequency. The issues were also addressed in a July 25, 2022, rating decision. The Veteran then challenged the rating decision by filing a request for Higher-Level Review which was received on August 11, 2022. An additional rating decision was thereafter issued on October 6, 2022, where again diabetes and urinary frequency entitlements to service connection were denied. 

The Veteran challenged the denials by filing a Notice of Disagreement on October 25, 2022. On November 7, 2022, a rating decision addressed the Veteran's left and right foot claims wherein a clear and unmistakable error was found, and separate evaluations were thereafter assigned. The Veteran did not take any further action pertaining to the left and right foot ratings and the November 7, 2022, rating decision became final. The Board reviewed the issues of diabetes and urinary frequency and remanded the matters in January 2025. Those matters are not before the Board currently. 

Here, the Veteran has continuously pursued the issues of entitlement to diabetes and urinary frequency since the filing of the Fully Developed Claim on January 19, 2022. Thus, the earliest receipt of claim date available is January 19, 2022, and the date entitlement arose or when it is factually ascertainable in the record that the Veteran's disabilities rendered him unable to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment is before January 19, 2022. 

Thus, with the January 19, 2022, date being later than the date entitlement arose, January 19, 2022, could be the earliest effective date according to law. 

However, as of January 19, 2022, the Veteran had a combined total service connection percentage of 100 percent. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a Veteran is totally disabled. Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994), citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990). 

Thus, if VA has found a veteran to be totally disabled because of a particular service-connected disability or combination of disabilities pursuant to the rating schedule, there is no need, and no authority, to otherwise rate that veteran totally disabled on any other basis. See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding a request for TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period).

Furthermore, the Veteran continued with a combined disability rating of 100 percent for his service-connected disabilities even when granted entitlement to service connection for depressive disorder with depressive features and unspecified anxiety disorder. The Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection with a 70 percent disability rating for depressive disorder with depressive features and unspecified anxiety disorder effective July 14, 2022. See August 26, 2022, Rating Decision. 

The grant of a combined 100 percent disability rating does not necessarily render the issue of TDIU moot. VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether his disabilities establish entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008). 

Such a scenario is present here, as the Veteran's depressive disorder with depressive features and unspecified anxiety disorder met scheduler requirements and rendered the Veteran unable to secure and maintain employment. 

This finding entitled the Veteran to individual unemployability effective July 14, 2022, as that is the day service connection was granted for the depressive disorder with depressive features and unspecified anxiety disorder. 

Prior to July 14, 2022, the Veteran did not have a single service-connected disability that rendered him unable to secure and maintain employment and thus did not entitle the Veteran to individual unemployability to warrant an earlier effective date.  

Thus, entitlement to an earlier effective date for TDIU must be denied.
