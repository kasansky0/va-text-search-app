ORDER

Entitlement to a rating higher than 30 percent for tinea corporis (also claimed as tinea versicolor) is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for seborrheic dermatitis is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire period on review, the Veteran's tinea corporis (also claimed as tinea versicolor) has manifested in lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; it has not manifested as characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a rating in excess of 30 percent for tinea corporis (also claimed as tinea versicolor) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7813.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1982 to September 1992.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2022 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes that the Veteran submitted new private medical evidence along with the VA Form 10182. As noted, the Board cannot consider this evidence as it was submitted after the December 2022 rating decision on appeal. In Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023) the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that the Board must seek clarification as to the review method selected when an appellant selects the Direct Review docket and attaches evidence to that Notice of Disagreement. See also 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (f). Pursuant to Edwards, in January 2025 the Board sent the Veteran a request for clarification. In January 2025, the Veteran submitted a letter clarifying that he does not elect to change to the Evidence Submission or Hearing dockets. Therefore, the Board will proceed to adjudicate this appeal. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for seborrheic dermatitis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c)(2)(ii). 

Neither the Veteran nor the Veteran's representative has raised any other issues with regard to the duty to notify or duty to assist as they pertain to the issues decided in this appeal. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

The analysis in this decision focuses on the most relevant evidence and on what the evidence shows or does not show with respect to the issues decided in this decision. The Veteran should not assume that evidence that is not explicitly discussed in the decision has been overlooked. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (noting that the law requires only that reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant be addressed).

Entitlement to a rating higher than 30 percent for tinea corporis (also claimed as tinea versicolor) 

The Veteran contends that objective medical evidence submitted in April 2020, December 2020, and June 2021 support a higher evaluation for his service-connected tinea corporis (also claimed as tinea versicolor). In September 2022, he stated that his rash is located on his face, ears, neck, scalp, and body; involve more than 40 percent of his entire body; and cause itching and pain on his scalp and neck.

By way of background, the Veteran was granted service connection for tinea corporis with an initial 30 percent rating in a June 2016 rating decision of the VA RO. 

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for seborrheic dermatitis and tinea versicolor in September 2022. Based on an October 2022 VA examiner's medical opinion, the RO recharacterized his service-connected tinea corporis as tinea corporis (also claimed as tinea versicolor) and treated the Veteran's September 2022 claim as a claim for an increased rating. The RO continued the 30 percent rating for tinea corporis (also claimed as tinea versicolor) in the December 2022 rating decision on appeal. 

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where an increase in the level of a service-connected disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). 

When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The appeal period before the Board begins September 16, 2022, the date VA received the Veteran's claim, plus the one-year look back period. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The analysis in this decision will focus on evidence dated within the appeal period.

The Veteran's tinea corporis is rated under DC 7813 for dermatophytosis (ringworm: of body, tinea corporis). DC 7813 also applies to tinea versicolor.

VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective August 13, 2018. These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after August 13, 2018, therefore, these regulations apply to this claim. 

Effective August 13, 2018, a new General Rating Formula for the Skin applies to Diagnostic Codes 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. 

Under this formula, a 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: (1) characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or (2) systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.  

A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: (1) characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or (2) constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.  

The regulations for the General Formula state that, in the alternative, the disability can be rated as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DC's 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating for the Skin for DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824.

Current regulations explicitly state that systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 (a).

Summary of relevant medical evidence

In September 2022, the Veteran submitted private treatment records pertaining to his skin conditions. A September 2020 letter from K.B., nurse practitioner, stated that the Veteran was treated in their office in February 2018 for seborrheic dermatitis of the face, scalp, and ears which covered six percent of his body surface area and for tinea corporis of trunk, groin, and upper and lower extremities which accounted for 40 percent of his body surface area. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's argument that this serves as objective findings warranting a higher rating. Unfortunately, the Board cannot consider this as evidence of the Veteran's present level of disability, because it relates to February 2018 which is before the appeal period in the present claim, which began September 16, 2022, the date VA received the Veteran's claim, plus the one-year look back period. Gaston, supra. 

At an April 2022 private dermatology new patient video visit, the Veteran reported rash on scalp and face, ongoing since military services; that he was using topical medications; and that he had been prescribed an oral medication by a VA dermatologist. The treatment record did not indicate when the oral medication was prescribed. The Board notes that the evidence of record contains no VA dermatology records dated within the appeal period. The Veteran's physical examination showed nasolabial folds and beard with brown patches with no frank alopecia appreciated by video. The provider diagnosed dermatitis of the scalp, face, and body and noted that a seborrheic dermatitis diagnosis was favored versus atopic dermatitis or tinea due to the history and chronicity. The provider prescribed several topical medications and did not notate what percentage of the Veteran's body or exposed areas were affected.

In October 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA skin diseases examination. The examiner listed the Veteran's diagnoses as seborrheic dermatitis diagnosed in 2018 and dermatophytosis/tinea versicolor diagnosed in 1983. Regarding service-connected tinea versicolor, the Veteran stated that the rash has been intermittent and affects his arms, trunk, back, groin, and legs. The Veteran also reported being treated with non-systemic, topical only corticosteroids for six weeks or more during the past 12 months. The Veteran's physical examination showed that his service-connected dermatophytosis affected 20 to 40 percent of his total body area and none of his exposed area (face, neck, and hands). The dermatophytosis/tinea versicolor appeared as small circular hypo-pigmented spots, few scattered spots, located on his arms, trunk, back, groin, and legs. His non-service-connected dermatitis lesions affected less than five percent of his total body area and less than five percent of his exposed areas and appeared as scattered small scaly lesions on his scalp, face, and neck. The examiner also noted that the Veteran's skin conditions did not cause scarring or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck. The Veteran reported that his skin conditions caused no functional impact on his ability to work. The examiner remarked that the Veteran has more than one skin condition and the combined total body area affected was 20 to 40 percent and combined total exposed area affected was five to less than 20 percent.

Analysis

Here, the evidence of record demonstrates that the predominant service-connected disability is dermatophytosis (tinea corporis/tinea versicolor) There is no competent evidence of scarring or disfigurement, therefore, DCs 7800 to 7805 do not apply.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a rating in excess of 30 percent because the Veteran's tinea corporis does not more nearly approximate (1) characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or (2) constant or near-constant systemic therapy required over the past 12-month period. At the October 2022 VA skin diseases examination, the Veteran's tinea versicolor was noted to affect 20 to 40 percent of his total body area and none of his exposed area and he denied being treated with systemic (non-topical) therapy over the past 12-month period.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects. Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, to include rash on his face, ears, neck, scalp, and body, and these reports are credible. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). However, the October 2022 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's service-connected dermatophytosis/tinea corporis affected 20 to 40 percent of his total body area and none of his exposed area. The Board finds the VA examiner's statement to be highly probative evidence that the Veteran has not met the criteria for a 60 percent rating for his service-connected tinea corporis throughout the appeal period. It was based on an objective in-person physical examination of the Veteran by a medical professional.

The Board has considered whether any other DCs related to disabilities of the skin would provide for a higher disability evaluation. However, the evidence does not reflect that the tinea corporis would warrant a higher rating under a different diagnostic code. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim of a rating in excess of 30 percent for tinea corporis, also claimed as tinea versicolor. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 30 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for seborrheic dermatitis 

By way of background, in January 2019 a VA skin diseases examiner noted new diagnoses of acanthosis nigricans and seborrheic dermatitis. The seborrheic dermatitis appeared as dry flaky skin located on the Veteran's bilateral groin, affecting less than 5 percent of total body area and no exposed area. The examiner remarked that a 1990 service treatment record listed skin condition to posterior neck and groin area that was not entered in original claim and consistent with current diagnosis of acanthosis nigricans and seborrheic dermatitis, and these conditions are separate and unrelated to service-connected disabilities. 

In August 2019, the Veteran underwent another skin diseases VA examination. He reported that the seborrheic dermatitis affecting his face, scalp, and ears began in 1990, when he was in Mississippi and noticed a rash on his scalp which spread to his face and ears. He reported that while on active duty he was treated by a dermatologist and has been receiving treatment from a dermatologist since separation. The August 2019 physical examination showed that the dermatitis affected less than five percent of his total body area and exposed area and appeared as scaly lesions on his scalp. The Veteran's service-connected tinea corporis was noted to affect less than 20 percent of his total body area and no exposed area and appeared as circular scaly irregular plaques located on his anterior and posterior trunk and right arm.

Contrary to the January 2019 examiner's remarks, the August 2019 examiner opined that the Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis and acanthosis nigricans was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner acknowledged an April 1988 dermatology treatment record that noted a scaly rash on the right side of the Veteran's forehead and a diagnosis of eczema. However, the examiner explained that it would be speculation to indicate that the eczema diagnosis is seborrheic dermatitis because the description of skin condition does not show this. 

In June 2021, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim requesting an increased rating for his tinea corporis and dermatitis. A June 2021 VA examiner diagnosed one skin condition only: tinea corporis. The examiner also noted a July 1984 treatment record noting rash on the arms and neck. The Veteran reported that his skin condition began in 1980 and affected his body and head. The physical examination showed that his tinea corporis affected 20 to 40 percent of his total body area and no exposed area and appeared as raised red rash located on his groin back, chest, stomach, legs, and arms. In July 2021, the RO issued a rating decision continuing the 30 percent rating for tinea corporis and noting that the June 2021 VA examiner narrowed his diagnosis to tinea corporis. 

As mentioned, in September 2022 the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for tinea versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis that the RO later treated as a claim for an increased rating. In an attached statement, the Veteran requested multiple ratings for his different skin conditions if deemed necessary, specifically requested a rating for seborrheic dermatitis and tinea versicolor, and asserted that these conditions may have been misdiagnosed or late diagnosed. He stated that the rash is located on his face, ears, neck, scalp, and body. 

An October 2022 VA examiner listed diagnoses of seborrheic dermatitis and dermatophytosis/tinea versicolor. The Veteran reported that his seborrheic dermatitis began in 2015 and affected his scalp and face and that his tinea versicolor began in 1983 and affected his arms, trunk, back, groin, and legs. His physical examination showed that his dermatitis affected less than five percent of his total body area and exposed area and appeared as scattered small scaly lesions on his scalp, face, and neck. His tinea versicolor affected 20 to 40 percent of his total body area and no exposed area and appeared as small circular hypo-pigmented spots on his arms, trunk, back, groin, and legs.

The October 2022 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed seborrheic dermatitis was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner explained, based on review of the available evidence, that there is scant data supporting a nexus between the current diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis and military service and without chronicity during service or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology. Based on this opinion, the December 2022 rating decision on appeal denied service connection for seborrheic dermatitis.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the RO decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2) RO errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). 

Where VA provides an examination or obtains an opinion, it must be adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). The Board must be able to conclude that a medical expert has applied valid medical analysis to the significant facts of the particular case in order to reach the conclusion submitted in the medical opinion. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). An examiner must consider the veteran's lay assertions when rendering an opinion. Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007).

The Board finds that the October 2022 VA medical opinion is inadequate for adjudication purposes because it ignored the Veteran's August 2019 statement to a VA examiner that the seborrheic dermatitis affecting his face, scalp, and ears began in 1990, when he was in Mississippi and noticed a rash on his scalp which spread to his face and ears. It also ignored November 2019 and May 2021 VA treatment records noting a reported 30- to 40-year history of seborrheic dermatitis symptoms affecting his head and the April 2022 private dermatology record indicating rash on scalp and neck ongoing since military service. The opinion also ignored the Veteran's contention that his seborrheic dermatitis may have been misdiagnosed or late diagnosed and failed to address service treatment records indicating complaints of rash to his face and neck. See June 1980, April 1983, July 1984, April 1988, and May 1990 service treatment records.

The Veteran has consistently reported that the seborrheic dermatitis affects his scalp, face, neck, and ears and his tinea corporis affects his arms, trunk, back, groin, and legs. The VA examination findings are generally consistent with this. In narrowing the Veteran's service-connected diagnosis to tinea corporis, the RO effectively precluded consideration of lesions affecting the Veteran's head and neck, thus potentially limiting his rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 (b) states that two or more skin conditions may be combined only if separate areas of skin are involved. The evidence of record does not contain competent medical evidence of a nexus between the Veteran's current seborrheic dermatitis and an in-service disease or injury. While the Board regrets the additional delay, a remand is necessary. The Veteran is encouraged to provide private treatment records or other corroborating evidence that his claimed disability continued since service.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate medical professional who has the requisite experience to render the requested medical opinion. Provide the examiner with the Veteran's complete record, including prior VA skin diseases examinations, the April 2022 private dermatology record, and the Veteran's September 2022 Statement in Support of Claim. No examination of the Veteran is necessary unless the examiner deems otherwise.

The examiner shall provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis had its onset during or is otherwise etiologically related to the Veteran's active service.

The examiner must address the Veteran's contentions, including that his seborrheic dermatitis was misdiagnosed or late diagnosed.

The examiner must also specifically address the June 1980, April 1983, July 1984, April 1988, and May 1990 service treatment records noting complaints of rash on his head or neck; the November 2019 and May 2021 VA treatment records noting a reported 30- to 40-year history of seborrheic dermatitis symptoms affecting his head; and the April 2022 private treatment record noting a reported history of rash to his scalp and face since military service.

A complete rationale must be provided for any opinion or conclusion expressed. The clinician must note that a lack of contemporaneous medical evidence does not, in and of itself, render lay evidence not credible. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). If the examiner is unable to provide this opinion without resorting to speculation, he or she must indicate why this is so.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
