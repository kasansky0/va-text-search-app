ORDER

The appeal regarding the issue of entitlement to basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (Post-9/11 GI Bill) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a September 2023 decision, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Muskogee, Oklahoma determined that the Veteran satisfied the basic eligibility criteria for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There remains no case or controversy with respect to the issue of entitlement to basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) over which the Board may exercise jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.103, 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 2012 to September 2018.  

The determination underlying the present appeal was issued in March 2023 by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Muskogee, Oklahoma. This matter was docketed at the Board based on a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) received in March 2023, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

Dismissal

The Board's jurisdiction is limited to review of questions in a matter which is subject to decision by the Secretary under 38 U.S.C. § 511(a). 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a). One of the principal functions of the Board is to make determinations of appellate jurisdiction. 38 C.F.R. § 20.103. The Board may address questions pertaining to its jurisdictional authority to review a particular case. 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c). In addition, the Board may dismiss a procedurally defective appeal if improperly docketed under claims processing rules. Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, at 333 (2021).

?

In a September 2023 decision, the RO in Muskogee, Oklahoma determined that the Veteran satisfied the basic eligibility criteria for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill). As the benefit sought on appeal has already been allowed, there remains no case or controversy regarding the issue of the Veteran's entitlement to Chapter 33 education benefits over which the Board may exercise jurisdiction. See Shoen v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 456, 457 (1994) (a case or controversy must exist in order to obtain appellate review). The present appeal must therefore be dismissed.
