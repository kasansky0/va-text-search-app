ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on a secondary basis, as due to his service connected disabilities with obesity as an intermediate step, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, he is sedentary due to service-connected disabilities, including but not limited to degenerative disc disease with intervertebral disc syndrome (lumbar disability), a right shoulder disability, bilateral hip disabilities, bilateral knee disabilities, bilateral ankle disabilities, and posttraumatic stress disorder; his sedentary lifestyle causes obesity; and his obesity aggravated his claimed OSA.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for OSA, as due to his service connected disabilities with obesity as an intermediate step, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from October 1997 to January 1998, December 2003 to April 2005, June 2008 to March 2009, and December 2009 to January 2011, with additional service in the Army National Guard.   

In August 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of this claim, most recently addressed in a July 2022 rating decision.  In November 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran maintains that he has OSA as the result of active duty service, including as due to his service-connected degenerative disc disease with intervertebral disc syndrome (lumbar disability), right shoulder disability, bilateral hip disabilities, bilateral knee disabilities, bilateral ankle disabilities, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  See March 2022 Statement in Support of Claim; August 2022 Supplemental Claim.  For the following reasons, the Board finds service connection warranted in this case.  

Service connection is granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service in the line of duty.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or an injury; and (3) a causal relationship ("nexus") between the current disability and the disease or injury in service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for disability caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability, although in this latter instance compensation is limited to the extent of disability owing to the aggravation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) and (b); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).  Obesity, while not a compensable disability itself, can serve as an intermediate step between a service-connected disability and a present disability for the purposes of secondary service connection.  See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), a disability which is proximately due to, or the result of a service-connected disease or injury is service connected.  Where there are potentially multiple causes of harm, an action is considered a proximate cause of the harm if it is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm and the harm would not have occurred but for the action.  See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017; see also Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 306-07 (2020) (holding that obesity can be an "intermediate step" in a causal chain for service connection can be established on either a causal or aggravation basis).

The rating decision on appeal reflects a binding, favorable finding that the Veteran has a current OSA diagnosis and therefore, a current disability.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  It also finding that the primary disabilities, including the various musculoskeletal disabilities and PTSD, have been awarded service connection.  Therefore, the remaining issue for the Board is to determine whether the Veteran's OSA is attributable to, or aggravated by, his service-connected disabilities.  

The AOJ obtained an April 2022 VA examination and medical opinion that found a current OSA disability but concluded that there is no evidence of record or in accepted medical literature suggesting that the Veteran's musculoskeletal disabilities or PTSD causes OSA.  The medical opinion did not discuss whether the Veteran's service connected disabilities aggravate his claimed condition.  Failure to provide that analysis renders this April 2022 medical opinion insufficient to assess secondary service connection.  El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013).  The Board accordingly finds this medical opinion to be of no probative value. 

The AOJ obtained a second, June 2022 VA medical opinion evaluating whether the Veteran's service connected disabilities caused obesity, leading to his OSA.  This medical opinion again failed to discuss whether the Veteran's service connected disabilities aggravated his claimed condition, rendering it inadequate for rating purposes.  Id.  Further, the examiner concluded that there is no causal relationship between "lack of physical activity" and weight gain, although weight gain is caused by conditions including "consuming more calories than are expended."  This is internally contradictory and detracts from the probative value of the medical opinion.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (holding that conclusory, contradictory, or incomplete analysis is inadequate).  This medical opinion is accordingly also of no probative value.  

The Veteran filed an August 2022 private provider opinion from Dr. Z.M.  It is unclear on record whether Dr. Z.M. is a treating provider or what his relationship is to the Veteran.  However, his submission accurately cited multiple medical records, including the Veteran's prescribed PTSD and pain management medications, and addressed the 110 pound weight gain from active duty separation in January 2011 to August 2022.  This evidence was discussed in the context of medical research and journal articles associating the prescribed medications with lack of exercise and eventual obesity, with research studies further linking obesity to OSA.  Dr. Z.M. concluded that the Veteran's service connected PTSD and musculoskeletal disabilities caused weight gain, classified as obesity, that aggravated and may have even caused OSA.  Dr. Z.M. found no evidence of another causal factor that could otherwise explain the development of this claimed condition.  Dr. Z.M. accordingly concluded that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's service connected disabilities resulted in obesity that at least aggravated, if not outright caused, his OSA.  Walsh, 32 Vet. App. at 306-07.  

In addition to providing a complete medical analysis, factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims folder and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000).  The Board is cognizant that Dr. Z.M.'s medical opinion does not indicate any specific access to the claims file or Veteran.  Regardless, this August 2022 medical opinion accurately cites the medical record, is unrefuted by the probative evidence of record, appears based on a review of the Veteran's medical and military history, presented with a cogent rationale supporting its findings, and is consistent with the Veteran's treatment record and lay statements, rendering it probative.  Nieves-Rodriguez, supra.

In sum, the Board finds that the probative evidence of record is in the Veteran's favor, as the only other medical opinions of record are inadequate for rating purposes.  Because the probative evidence of record supports finding that the Veteran's claimed OSA is at least as likely as not attributable service, including as due to his PTSD and musculoskeletal disabilities with obesity as an intermediate step, service connection for OSA is hereby GRANTED on a secondary basis.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).
