DOCKET NO. 240830-470356
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

The issue of entitlement to service connection for somatic sleep disorder (also claimed as anxiety condition) in Docket 240830-470356 is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a separate appeal stream at Docket 240315-424404, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) consolidated the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for somatic sleep disorder (also claimed as anxiety) with an existing claim for service connection for fatigue. All these issues were addressed in the same rating decision on appeal.

2. This appeal stream is now a concurrent appeal stream and is dismissed.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim for service connection for somatic sleep disorder (also claimed as anxiety condition) in Docket 240830-470356 have been met.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1992 to May 1997.

Entitlement to service connection for somatic sleep disorder.

This appeal stream resulted from an August 2024 VA Form 10182. However, the Veteran appealed the issue of service connection for fatigue in a March 2024 VA Form 10182. In an April 2025 decision, the Board recharacterized the claim for service connection for fatigue as a claim for service connection for a sleep disorder, also claimed as anxiety and fatigue. Also, a VA examiner suggested back pain, which is also on appeal in the other stream, may be linked to insomnia disorder. 

As such, the Board finds it is more beneficial to the Veteran for the issue of service connection for a sleep disorder to remain in the other stream. Of note, both streams stem from the same rating decision, so there is no prejudice to the Veteran with this decision. 

Therefore, this situation amounts to a concurrent appeal stream for the same issue. Thus, this appeal stream must be dismissed. 

Under the Appeals Modernization Act, concurrent or duplicate election is prohibited, meaning that once a claimant has filed for review through one option (i.e., higher-level review, supplemental claim, Board review), she cannot seek review under a different one, or in multiple ones, while that review is pending final adjudication. 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.2500(b). Here, the Board has recharacterized the claim for service connection for fatigue into a claim for service connection for a sleep disorder also claimed as anxiety and fatigue, which amounts to concurrent and duplicate review of the same issue.

Accordingly, the appropriate remedy is to dismiss this appeal due to procedural error. Id.; see Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021) (The Board may not dismiss an improperly docketed appeal for lack of jurisdiction but is not precluded from dismissing it for other non-jurisdictional reasons such as a procedural defect-a violation of the claims processing rules).

The Veteran's claim for service connection for a sleep disorder is addressed in a separate Board decision based upon the previously filed appeal stream.
