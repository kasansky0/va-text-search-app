ORDER

The December 18, 2024 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision denying an earlier effective date for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is vacated.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to August 22, 2017, for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

1. In a December 2024 Board decision, the Veteran's appeal for entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for PTSD was dismissed due to an oversight regarding whether he had received an extension for filing his claim as well as a clerical error regarding whether he had responded to previous correspondence from the Board. The dismissal of his earlier effective date claim for PTSD denied him due process of law.

2. August 22, 2017, the date VA received the Veteran's intent to file a claim, is the earliest possible effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The December 18, 2024 Board decision, denying an earlier effective date for service connection for PTSD, is vacated. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7013, 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to August 22, 2017, for the grant of service connection for PTSD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1992 to November 2004.

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2020 notice of rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the April 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R.             §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Vacatur

The December 18, 2024 Board decision, denying an earlier effective date for service connection for PTSD, is vacated.

The Board may vacate an appellate decision at any time upon request of the appellant or his or her representative, or on the Board's own motion, when an appellant has been denied due process of law or when benefits were allowed based on false or fraudulent evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.904.

In a prior December 2024 decision, the Board summarily dismissed the Veteran's appeal for an earlier effective date for service connection for PTSD. However, the December 2024 Board decision did not reference the May 2022 letter granting an extension for filing the April 2022 VA Form 10182. In addition, the Veteran responded to September 2024 correspondence from the Board regarding this untimeliness, however it appears that due to an apparent clerical issue, this response was not entered into the Veteran's file until after the deadline for response had passed. None of these issues are the result of any of the Veteran's actions. Rather, his April 2022 filing of VA Form 10182 was timely as a result of the extension granted by the Board, and his response to the September 2024 BVA letter was also timely.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran was denied due process of law when the Board issued decisions and the December 18, 2024 earlier effective date claim must be vacated.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000(a).

Having vacated the Board's December 18, 2024, decision, the Board will proceed to adjudicating the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for PTSD on its underlying merits.

Earlier Effective Date

Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to August 22, 2017, for service connection for PTSD is denied.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The laws and regulations in effect prior to March 24, 2015, required that a formal or informal claim must be filed for any type of benefit to accrue or be paid, and a claim for service connection must indicate an intent to apply for that benefit. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151 (a), 3.155(a) (in effect prior to March 24, 2015); Jones v. West, 136 F.3d. 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 1998). The March 24, 2015, amendments that require claims for benefits be submitted on the form prescribed by the Secretary are not applicable because the dates at issue are prior to these amendments. 38 C.F.R.        § 3.155 (prior to March 24, 2015).

Prior to March 24, 2015, an informal claim is "[a]ny communication or action, indicating an intention to apply for one or more benefits.... Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought." 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a) (2009). Thus, the essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009). The Board will also note a potentially applicable exception to the informal claim requirements under pre-amended 38 C.F.R. § 3.157 (as in effect prior to March 24, 2015) for Report of examination or hospitalization as a claim for increase or reopen.

A decision that is not appealed becomes final one year after the claimant is notified of the decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103. When there is a prior final decision in the claims file and a later reopened claim results in a grant of the benefit, the general rule for effective dates for reopened claims applies. In such cases, the effective date cannot be earlier than the subsequent claim to reopen. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r), 3.400(q)(2); see Leonard v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2004); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 246-50 (2002), aff'd, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332, 340 (1995). "Nothing in the statute indicates that an effective date can be set based upon an application that resulted in a final disallowance of the claim." Wright v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 343, 347 (1997).

A final rating decision is not subject to revision on the same factual basis except by duly constituted appellate authorities, or when the decision contains clear and unmistakable error (CUE) as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105. See 38 C.F.R.              § 3.104(a). In order for the Veteran to be awarded an effective date based on an earlier claim, he or she has to show CUE in the prior denial of the claim. Flash, 8 Vet. App. 332, 340 (1995); see also Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299 -00 (2006). CUE is a very rare kind of error, which must be clearly and specifically alleged, and is not at issue in this case. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 20.1403.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for service connection for PTSD. Specifically, he has asserted that he should be granted an effective date of November 2004. See April 2022 Notice of Disagreement. The Board notes that the Veteran left active duty in November 2004. See March 2007 VA DD 214. He had previously applied for service connection for PTSD, while still on active duty. See September 2004 VA 21-526 Veterans Application for Compensation or Pension.

By way of procedural history, in September 2004, VA received a compensation claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD, among other disabilities. Service connection for PTSD was subsequently denied in a February 2005 rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal the February 2005 rating decision within one year, and no other pertinent exception to finality applies. As such, the February 2005 rating decision became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100.

The Board acknowledges that there were additional service treatment records associated with the claims file subsequent to the February 2005 rating decision. Specifically, there were Service Treatment Records entered into the file in December 2007, January 2008, and then a number of additional Service Treatment Records entered in December 2014. 

VA regulation provides that, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of the same section (which defines new and material evidence). 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). The regulation further identifies service records related to a claimed in-service event, injury, or disease as relevant service department records. 38 C.F.R.               § 3.156(c)(1)(i). 

In this case, the additional evidence received is redundant of the evidence previously of record, and is not relevant to the appeal, as it does not tend to prove or disprove any matter in issue, i.e., whether or not the Veteran's stressors rise to the level of an extreme, traumatic, and verifiable stressor. Notably, there was an additional therapist report from September 13, 2004, in his Service Treatment Records that had not been discussed in the February 2005 rating decision. This report, however, is nearly identical to the other report that was discussed in the February 2005 rating decision. Further, as stated, it did not speak to the severity of the Veteran's stressors, but rather, briefly discussed his symptoms at the time of the report and discussed ongoing treatment. None of these reports contradict or add information relevant to either rating decision such that readjudication would be required. Accordingly, reconsideration of the Veteran's claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) is not required based upon the additionally received personnel records.

On August 22, 2017, however, the AOJ received the Veteran's intent to file a claim, and subsequently received the Veteran's fully developed claim for PTSD in November 2017. See August 2022 Notification Letter; November 2017 VA 21-526EZ. In the December 2017 rating decision, service connection for PTSD was granted, effective August 22, 2017 (the date the AOJ received the Veteran's intent to file a claim).

As the February 2005 rating decision became final, the effective date of the Veteran's claim of entitlement for service connection for PTSD cannot be earlier than the subsequent claim to reopen. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r), 3.400(q)(2); see Leonard, 17 Vet. App. at 452; Sears, 16 Vet. App. at 246-50; Flash, 8 Vet. App. at 340. Furthermore, between the final February 2005 rating decision and the August 22, 2017, receipt of the Veteran's intent to file, there is no communication, formal or informal, from the Veteran that can in any way be construed as a claim for service connection for PTSD.

Here, the earliest possible effective date for the Veteran's award of service connection for PTSD is August 22, 2017, the date the Veteran submitted his intent to file a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r), 3.400(q)(2).

Additionally, no evidence has been presented that the Veteran never received notification of the denial of his claim for PTSD in February 2005. The presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers, and, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties. Romero v. Tran, 33 Vet. App. 252, 254 (2021). A claimant may rebut the presumption of regularity by producing clear evidence that VA's mailing practices are not regular or that regular practices were not followed. Ashley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 307, 309 (1992). Here, the Veteran has neither alleged, nor does the record show, that he did not receive such notice.

As the Board has found that the February 2005 rating decision became final, the Veteran would have to clearly and specifically allege a claim for CUE to allow for consideration of an effective date prior to August 22, 2017. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 296 (holding that a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date is a nullity, and the only basis for challenging the effective date of a now final decision is CUE). Consequently, an effective date prior to August 22, 2017, for the grant of service connection for PTSD is not warranted.
