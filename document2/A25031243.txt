ORDER

An earlier effective date of August 29, 2016 for service connection for eczema/neurodermatitis is granted.

An earlier effective date of May 20, 2022 for service connection for right leg lymphedema is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. An intent to file was received by VA on August 29, 2016, followed within one year by a formal claim for service connection for a skin condition. Following an initial denial of the claim for service connection for a skin condition, the Veteran timely appealed, opted into RAMP, and subsequently continuously pursued the claim until the March 2024 grant of service connection for eczema/neurodermatitis.

2. A claim for service connection for right leg lymphedema was received by VA on May 20, 2022. This claim was continuously pursued until the March 2024 grant of service connection. 

3. While the March 2024 rating decision contains conflicting language regarding the claim for service connection for right leg lymphedema (referring to it in parts as being for service connection for right knee osteoarthritis), the Board finds that any reference to service connection for right knee osteoarthritis (for which the Veteran was already service-connected) was a scrivener's error. Based on a holistic review of the record, the March 2024 rating decision granted service connection for right leg lymphedema.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an earlier effective date of August 29, 2016 for service connection for eczema/neurodermatitis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an earlier effective date of May 20, 2022 for service connection for right leg lymphedema have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1987 to May 1988, in the United States Navy.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In May 2024, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, electing the Direct Review docket. 

Given this procedural history, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision. See 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. If any evidence was submitted after the March 2024 rating decision, it was not considered. If the Veteran would like any such evidence to be considered, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The Board notes that in her VA Form 10182, the Veteran listed the rating decision on appeal as March 2024 and the issues on appeal as earlier effective dates for the grants of service connection for 1) eczema/neurodermatitis and 2) right knee osteoarthritis. Upon review of the record on appeal, the Board finds that the March 2024 rating decision on appeal contains a scrivener's error regarding the second issue. In the March 2024 rating decision, the RO noted in the introduction that service connection for right knee joint osteoarthritis was granted but in the body of the decision referred to the condition as right leg lymphedema. Based on a holistic review of the record, the Board finds that the claim that was granted in the March 2024 rating decision was service connection for right leg lymphedema, and that, accordingly, the Veteran's May 2024 appeal is seeking an earlier effective date for service connection for right leg lymphedema. See claim stream beginning with Veteran's May 2022 claim for service connection for right leg lymphedema, September 2022 rating decision denying service connection for right leg lymphedema, Veteran's January 2023 request for higher level review of the denial of service connection for right leg lymphedema, RO's April 2023 identification of a duty-to-assist error regarding the claim for service connection for right leg lymphedema and the February 2024 request for a medical opinion regarding the claim for service connection for right leg lymphedema; see also April 2023 codesheet showing that the Veteran was already service connected for right knee conditions that included osteoarthritis. 

Earlier effective date claims

The effective date for a grant of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date for an award based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), if a claimant "continuously pursues" an issue by timely filing any of the available review options (supplemental claim, request for higher level review, or Board appeal) within one year of the issuance of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). 

Under the pre-AMA (legacy) regulations, appellate review of an RO decision was initiated by a notice of disagreement and completed by a VA Form 9 (substantive appeal). 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 19.20.

1. An effective date earlier than August 10, 2022 for service connection for eczema/neurodermatitis

2. An effective date earlier than August 10, 2022 for service connection for right leg lymphedema

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for eczema/neurodermatitis and right leg lymphedema, effective August 10, 2022. The Veteran contends that earlier effective dates for service connection are warranted.

As noted above, the effective date of an award is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. The current effective date of August 10, 2022 is based on the date of enactment of the PACT Act. Accordingly, the question before the Board is whether service connection is warranted on any basis that does not rely on the PACT Act presumptions that became effective on August 10, 2022. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (when presumptive service connection is not warranted, an appellant is not precluded from establishing service connection with proof of direct causation).

The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that all elements necessary for service connection on a direct/facts-found basis have been shown for both disabilities. 

At an October 2017 VA skin diseases examination, the examiner reported a 2013 diagnosis of eczema/neurodermatitis. Also, the Veteran's VA treatment records contain a December 2021 diagnosis of right leg lymphedema. 

In a February 2024 VA memorandum, based on the Veteran's military occupational specialty of Navy Hull Maintenance Technician, VA conceded in-service exposure to fuel products such as diesel, JP-8, JP-4, tars, industrial solvents used in cleaning, degreasing, paint fumes, benzene, acids, adhesives, glues, caulking compounds, fluxes, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric zinc chloride, inorganic lead, carbon monoxide, pest- or rodent-transmitted diseases, and possibly asbestos.

In February 2024, a VA medical opinion was obtained regarding the Veteran's claim for service connection for a skin condition. The examiner noted the toxic exposure discussed above and opined that the Veteran's eczema and neurodermatitis were at least as likely as not caused by this exposure. The examiner explained that "[d]ue to the dermal contact of chemicals and toxics to include paint fumes and industrial solvents veteran developed irritation of the skin that has led to eczema [and neurodermatitis]."

In February 2024, a VA medical opinion was also obtained regarding the Veteran's claim for service connection for right leg lymphedema. The examiner opined that the Veteran's right leg lymphedema condition was also at least as likely as not caused by her in-service toxic exposure risk activities. In a similar way to the opinion discussed above, the examiner explained that the Veteran's skin contact with various chemical substances caused skin irritation that led to right leg lymphedema. 

The Board finds these medical opinions to be probative as they consider the medical evidence of record and provide explanations that contain clear conclusions and supporting data. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

As entitlement to service connection on a direct basis has been shown for both disabilities, the next question before the Board is the date of receipt of the claims. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) (stating that effective date of award "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor"); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Regarding the Veteran's skin condition claim, on August 29, 2016, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension (intent to file) and, within one year, in August 2017 filed a claim for service connection for a skin disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b) (permitting claimants to submit an intent to file and noting that as long as a complete application for benefits is received within one year of the intent to file, VA will consider the complete claim as having been filed on the date of the intent to file). The Veteran's claim was initially denied in an October 2017 legacy rating decision. The Veteran timely initiated an appeal in the traditional manner with a November 2017 notice of disagreement. However, in February 2019, the Veteran opted to participate in VA's Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) test program, the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP). A RAMP rating decision was subsequently issued in September 2019, which again denied the claim for service connection for eczema/neurodermatitis. Around two years later, in October 2021, the Veteran filed a request for higher level review of the September 2019 rating decision and a request for a good cause extension of the one-year filing deadline, citing COVID-19 related delays. In the subsequent November 2021 higher level review rating decision, the RO granted the Veteran's request for a time limit extension and again denied service connection for eczema/neurodermatitis. The Veteran filed a supplemental claim in May 2022, which was denied in a September 2022 rating decision. The Veteran filed a request for higher level review in January 2023. In April 2023, a duty-to-assist error was identified and, following additional development, the May 2024 rating decision on appeal was issued. 

Given the above, the Board finds that the Veteran has maintained continuous pursuit of her claim for service connection for eczema/neurodermatitis since her August 29, 2016 intent to file. The Veteran timely appealed the initial denial of her claim, timely opted her legacy appeal into the AMA appeal system, and subsequently filed an available AMA review option within one year of all subsequent decisions (or received a good cause extension). Accordingly, the remaining question is when entitlement to service connection arose. If it arose prior to the August 29, 2016 date of claim, then the proper effective date is the August 29, 2016 date of claim. If it arose after the date of claim, then the proper effective date is the date entitlement arose. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). A July 2013 VA dermatology record contains a diagnosis of "eczema vs. neurodermatitis." As discussed above, the medical evidence of record persuasively attributes this skin condition to the Veteran's toxic exposures during her service. Therefore, entitlement to service connection for eczema/neurodermatitis arose as of the July 2013 diagnosis. See McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000) (holding that in determining when entitlement arose, the Board must determine when a claimant's disability manifested itself under all the facts found and the date on which the evidence is submitted is irrelevant). As the date of claim was later than when entitlement arose, the proper effective date is the date of claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Accordingly, the proper effective date for the grant of service connection for eczema/neurodermatitis is August 29, 2016, the date of claim. 

Regarding the Veteran's claim for service connection for right leg lymphedema, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for right leg lymphedema on May 20, 2022. This claim was denied in a September 2022 rating decision. The Veteran filed a request for higher level review in January 2023. In April 2023, a duty-to-assist error was identified and, following additional development, the March 2024 rating decision on appeal was issued. Accordingly, as the Veteran filed an available review option within one year of all rating decisions, the Board finds that the Veteran maintained continuous pursuit of her claim for service connection for right leg lymphedema since her May 20, 2022 claim. Thus, the remaining question is when entitlement to service connection arose. The Veteran's VA treatment records contain a December 2021 diagnosis of right leg lymphedema. As discussed above, the medical evidence of record persuasively attributes this condition to the Veteran's toxic exposures during her service. Therefore, entitlement to service connection for right leg lymphedema arose as of the December 2021 diagnosis. See McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35. As the date of claim is later than when entitlement arose, the proper effective date is the date of claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Accordingly, the proper effective date for the grant of service connection for right leg lymphedema is May 20, 2022, the date of claim.

In sum, an earlier effective date of August 29, 2016 for the award of service connection for eczema/neurodermatitis is granted and an earlier effective date of May 20, 2022 for the award of service connection for right leg lymphedema is granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.
