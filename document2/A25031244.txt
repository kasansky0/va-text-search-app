ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is denied. 

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a lower back injury is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have a left ear hearing loss disability for VA purposes.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for left ear?hearing loss have not been met.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107;?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from July 1991 to November 1991. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran filed a May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and selected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that the Veteran included entitlement to service connection for anxiety and depression as secondary to his tinnitus on his May 2024 VA Form 10182. As this issue was not previously claimed and adjudicated by the RO in a rating decision, the Board does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate this issue. As such, the issue of anxiety and depression as secondary to tinnitus is not on appeal. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran contends he suffers from left ear hearing loss as a result of his military service. Specifically, he asserts that he was exposed to hazardous noises from vehicles firing guns and explosions during service. 

Generally, service connection requires a showing of: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Hearing loss is considered a "present disability" for VA purposes when (a) the auditory threshold for any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater, (b) the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are at least 26 decibels, or (c) speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran was afforded a March 2024 VA examination. The examination reveals the following puretone thresholds: 

 

? 	HERTZ? 	 	 	 

 	A 	B 	C 	D 	E 	F 	G 	 

?? 	500 	1000? 	2000? 	3000? 	4000? 	6000 	8000 	Avg (B- E)? 

LEFT? 	15 	20	15	20	20	20	20	18.75

 

Further, the speech discrimination scores in the left ear revealed 94 percent. These do not establish a diagnosis of hearing loss for VA purposes. None of the auditory thresholds in the frequencies between 500 to 4000 hertz are 40 decibels are greater, nor are at least three of them 26 decibels or greater. Further, the speech recognition score under the Maryland CNC test are not below 94 percent. 

Based on the March 2024 examination findings, service connection for left ear hearing loss cannot be granted because the Veteran does not have severe enough left ear hearing loss to be a disability for VA purposes. Accordingly, service connection for left ear hearing loss must be denied.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any additional evidence of left ear hearing loss in the future, including evidence that his left ear hearing has worsened, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is remanded. 

After review of the record, the Board finds that the claim must be remanded to correct errors in satisfying VA's duty to assist and statutory requirements that occurred prior to the April 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

VA's duty to assist includes providing a medical examination and obtaining a medical opinion when there is competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability (or persistent or recurrent symptoms of disability) associated with active service but there is insufficient medical evidence to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 86 (2006). Once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination or medical opinion, it must provide an adequate one. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

VA has conceded that the Veteran has a present diagnosis of right ear hearing loss. VA has also conceded that the Veteran had an in-service injury because he had a military occupational specialty (MOS) of Unit Supply Specialist that is associated with noise exposure.

The March 2024 examiner opined that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss was less likely than not due to service because his MOS has a low probability of hazardous noise exposure, it is unlikely that he would suffer significant hearing loss from typical noise exposure during initial training, and that he only served on active duty for 4 months. This opinion is inadequate for adjudication because VA has conceded that the Veteran's MOS is associated with military noise exposure and the examiner did not sufficiently explain why the Veteran's noise exposure during training or his time on active duty weighs against causation. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (stating that the probative value of a medical opinion lies in factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning).

Because the only medical opinion of record is inadequate for adjudication, remand is required to obtain a new medical opinion.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a lower back injury is remanded.

Remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). Specifically, a medical opinion is needed to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's back condition. The Veteran contends that his back injury began during service. See December 2023 claim.

A medical examination or medical opinion is necessary if the information and evidence of record does not contain sufficient competent medical evidence to decide the claim, but: (1) contains competent evidence of a current diagnosed disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) establishes that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or certain diseases manifested during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies; and (3) indicates that the disability or symptoms may be associated with the established event, injury or disease in service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) there is insufficient competent evidence of record to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).

The record shows the Veteran has expressed that he has symptoms of a back condition. He asserts that his back injury occurred in service. The service treatment records confirm the Veteran injured his back during service. See February 1995 service records. As the McLendon elements have been met, a remand is necessary to afford the Veteran a VA examination. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion, with in-person or telehealth examination of the Veteran only if deemed necessary by a medical professional, to determine the etiology of the Veteran's right ear hearing loss. 

Provide a rationale to support the opinion. If the Veteran's right ear hearing loss is not a result of service, please opine as to its etiology.

2. Schedule the Veteran for an examination with a medical professional to determine the nature and etiology of his back condition. The examiner should review the Veteran's claims file, including a copy of this remand. The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

Is it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's back condition is related to his active service, or was caused by or aggravated by military service, including as a result of his in-service back injury? Provide a rationale to support the opinion(s).

?

In providing the requested opinions, consider the Veteran's description of his/her in-service injury and symptoms as well as his post-service symptoms. If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that the Veteran's reported injury and symptoms in service and thereafter represented the onset of his/her current disability, this should be noted. Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about his symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?
