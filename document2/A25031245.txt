ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left knee strain is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's left knee strain had its onset in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for left knee strain have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1154, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2009 to December 2012.

This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from July 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and readjudication of the claim for service connection for left knee disability was warranted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501 (a)(1), 19.2. The RO readjudicated the claim and denied it on the merits. The Board is bound by this favorable finding that new and relevant evidence was received warranting readjudication of the claim of service connection for left knee disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that the time to modify his NOD under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2) has not yet expired. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024) ("because [38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2)] gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up").  However, as the Board is granting the benefits sought in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in issuing the decision now.

Left Knee  

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in the active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Consistent with this framework, service connection is including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In the July 2024 rating decision, the RO found that the Veteran had a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during the Veteran's service. Specifically, the Veteran's service treatment records shows the Veteran reported bilateral knee pain at his August 2012 separation examination. The RO also found the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability. Specifically, February 2024 VA examination report shows a diagnosis of left knee strain. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A. Therefore, the Board will address whether the Veteran's current left knee disability is related to his active service.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in February 2024. The examiner opined that the claimed condition was at least as likely as not caused by the indicated toxic exposure activity(ies), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran. The examiner's rationale was at his separation examination, the Veteran complained of left knee pain when running and after long runs. The examiner explained that lower limb injuries are associated with physical exercises in the military, and they may be related to altered ankle and knee joint position sense due to fatigue. The examiner further explained that the rates of injury associated with vigorous weight-bearing exercise, such as marching or jumping, are high, and as the frequency, duration, or total amount of training increases, the injuries also increase. The examiner cited medical literature titled, Military Exercises, Knee and Ankle Joint Position Sense, and Injury in Male Conscripts: A Pilot Study-Nov 2013.  

The VA examiner provided an opinion based on toxic exposure activities, however, reading the opinion as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record, it is reasonable to infer from the VA examiner's rationale that the Veteran's in-service symptoms of left knee pain from physical exercises are related to the Veteran's currently diagnosed left knee strain.   Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record). Moreover, the VA examiner explained the reasons for his conclusions based on an accurate characterization of the evidence of record. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning).  There is no contrary medical opinion in the evidence of record.

Given the competent, probative evidence showing current left knee strain to an in-service knee injury and no probative evidence to the contrary, entitlement to service connection for left knee strain is warranted.
