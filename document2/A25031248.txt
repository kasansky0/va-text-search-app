REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for left upper arm disability including arthritis is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1989 to February 1991.	

This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim of left elbow condition including arthritis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Veteran was notified of the April 2024 decision in an April 2, 2024 letter.  Given that more than one year has elapsed since mailing of notice of the rating decision and more than 60 days have elapsed since receipt of the NOD, the time for the Veteran to switch dockets has elapsed.  Cf. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024) "because [38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2)] gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up").

The issue has been recharacterized on the title page based on the reasonable expectations of the claimant and statements made during the processing of the claim.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 4-5 (2009) (a claim should not be limited to the disorder as characterized by the Veteran but must be characterized and addressed based on the reasonable expectations of the non-expert claimant and the evidence in processing the claim).

Left Upper Extremity Disability

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran wrote in his NOD, "I missed an appointment and have been trying like hell to reschedule.  Also to be clear, it's my shoulder not my elbow.  Although these statements were made outside of the evidence window, the Board considers them more akin to argument than evidence.  The Board has thus recharacterized the claim more broadly on the title page.

The claim for service connection for left upper extremity disability is remanded to correct an error in satisfying a regulatory duty, as correction of the error has a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

In February 2024, the RO requested an examination to determine the etiology of the Veteran's left elbow disability. The Veteran subsequently failed to appear for scheduled VA examination on March 29, 2024. In the April 2024 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for left elbow. The RO noted that the Veteran failed to attend his scheduled VA examination without good cause.

Although there is an examination request document indicating that the Veteran was a "no show," the evidence of record is unclear as to whether the Veteran was informed of the date and time of the scheduled examination and the consequences for his failure to attend. In Kyhn v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 228, 237 (2011), the Court indicated that the presumption of regularity applied to notice of VA examinations. However, that decision was vacated on other grounds in Kyhn v. Shinseki, 716 F.3d 572 (Fed. Cir. 2013). On remand, the Court held that the Board is required to discuss the documents it relies on in making a finding that a veteran was notified of an examination at his correct address and to discuss whether this finding is based on the presumption of regularity. Kyhn v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 371 (2016). The Veteran indicated he was homeless on the February 2024 claim VA Form 21-526EZ application for disability compensation and related compensation benefits for which he sought compensation for left elbow. A VA Form 27-0820 report of general information on which the Veteran's homeless status is noted, shows the RO tried to call the Veteran but there was no answer. 

There is insufficient documentation from which the Board can conclude that the Veteran was properly notified of the date and time of his scheduled VA examination. The Board will remand the claim in order to schedule the Veteran for VA examination for his left elbow claim, with appropriate notification.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination with an appropriate VA clinician to determine the nature and etiology of any left upper extremity disability. Ensure that the Veteran is timely notified of the date and time of the examination at the correct and informed of the consequences of failure to attend the scheduled examination.  The notification of the date and time of the examination should be associated with the claims file.

If an examination cannot be scheduled an opinion should be provided without examination.

The claims file must be reviewed by the clinician. The examiner should answer the following question:

Is it at least as likely as not or approximately so that any left upper extremity disability is related to or had its onset during active service?

The clinician should consider the Veteran's statements about symptoms, treatment, and injuries, and these statements must be taken into account in formulating the requested opinion.  The clinician must provide a rationale for the conclusions reached.
