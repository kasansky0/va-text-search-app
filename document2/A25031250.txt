ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for metastatic cholangiocarcinoma is granted, on a direct basis.

Entitlement to service connection for a stroke and residual deficits, secondary to diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, on a causation basis, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's metastatic cholangiocarcinoma had onset in service.  

2. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's stroke and residual deficits was caused by the multifactorial service-connected disabilities of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's metastatic cholangiocarcinoma have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for a stroke and residual deficits, secondary to service-connected diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, on a causation basis, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310; Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F. 4th 1360, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2023); Payne v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 373, 384 (2019).  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army from October 1967 to July 1970.

These matters come the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an appeal of August 2024 and December 2024 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In the August 2024 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for stroke with residual deficits.  In the December 2024 rating decision, the AOJ readjudicated service connection for metastatic cholangiocarcinoma based upon the receipt of new and relevant evidence (and denied the claim of the merits).  The Board is bound by this favorable finding as to new and relevant evidence (see 38 C.F.R. §3.104(c)) and therefore proceeds to decide these claims on the merits of this service connection claim.  

In his March 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decisions on appeal.  

In his May 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decisions, as qualified above, on appeal.  

If evidence was added during the ineligible period, it has not been considered.  If this is the case, and the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any of this evidence, she can at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving a decision and the additional evidence would be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  If filed within one year, this supplemental claim would preserve the date of the claim as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

As a final introductory note, the Court has held that, because 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) "gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up."  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024).  As the Board is granting the benefit sought in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in adjudicating the matter prior to expiration of the relevant period.

Service connection: Applicable Law

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). E stablishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F. 3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

VA laws and regulations provide that, if a veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during service, certain listed diseases are presumptively service connected.  38 U.S.C. § 1116 (a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).  A veteran who served in or offshore of Vietnam is presumed to have been exposed during such service to herbicide agents.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1116(f), 1116A(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii).  

The Veteran's service personnel records indicate that he served in Vietnam and his DD Form 214 indicated that the Veteran received the Vietnam Campaign Medal and the Vietnam Service Medal. This reflects service in Vietnam and warrants the presumption of herbicide agent exposure.  Moreover, the availability of service connection on a presumptive basis does not preclude consideration of service connection on a direct basis pursuant to the principles noted above.  38 U.S.C. § 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection is also warranted for disability that is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). As pertinent to the instant matters, the Court has held that "for a veteran to be service connected on a secondary basis under a causation theory, the primary disability need not be service connected, or even diagnosed, at the time the secondary condition is incurred."  Frost v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 131, 133 (2017).  Moreover, "there is no such temporal requirement inherent in § 3.310(a), even when the veteran claims that the primary condition caused the secondary condition."  Id.  Secondary service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) is warranted where a non-service-connected disability would have been less severe but for a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability.  Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F. 4th 1360, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2023) ("but for" causation "applies to the natural progression of a condition not caused by a service-connected injury or disease, but that nonetheless would have been less severe were it not for the service-connected disability. Stated another way... compensation [is warranted] for a worsening of functionality-whether through an inability to treat or a more direct, etiological cause").  The Court has also held that the "'causation requirement in the phrase 'the result of' is 'broad,' in that it permits entitlement to VA benefits 'based on a multi-link causal chain.'"  Payne v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 373, 384 (2019).  See also Spicer, 61 F. 4th at 1364 ("The but-for causation standard is not limited to a single cause and effect, but rather contemplates multi-causal links, including action and inaction"). 

Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma

A review of the Veteran's 1000-page plus compendium of VA treatment records and progress notes; a June 2024 medical opinion VA-affiliated oncologist researcher (MD, PhD), Dr. B, and a September 2024 VA examination report reflects a diagnosis of metastatic cholangiocarcinoma (cancer originating in the bile ducts).  Therefore, the current disability requirement has been met.

Cholangiocarcinoma is defined as "an adenocarcinoma arising from the epithelium of the intrahepatic bile ducts, composed of eosinophilic cuboidal or columnar epithelial cells arranged in tubules or acini with abundant fibrous stroma." See DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 173 (31st Ed. 2007). It is also known as "bile duct cancer."  The bile duct is defined as "a duct by which bile passes from the gallbladder to the duodenum"  See https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bile%20duct#dictionary-entry-1 (last accessed on April 3, 2025).  Bile is defined as "a yellow or greenish alkaline fluid that is secreted by the liver, stored and concentrated in the gallbladder, and passed into the intestinal duodenum where it aids especially in the breakdown and absorption of fats.  Note: Bile is composed primarily of water containing various organic and inorganic components (such as bile salts, cholesterol, bilirubin, and electrolytes)."  See https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bile (last accessed on April 3, 2025).

As noted above, herbicide agent exposure in this case is presumed.  In his June 2024 opinion, Dr. B reported that the Veteran has been under his personal care since April 2024, after his initial oncology consultation in March 2023.  The Veteran's cholangiocarcinoma, according to this expert, is unresectable.  Noting that this disease entity is not a presumptive disease related to herbicide exposure, Dr. B provided a research-informed, evidence-informed, and anatomy-informed basis for rending a positive etiological opinion and to the Veteran's metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and herbicide exposure.  In pertinent part, Dr, B articulated that, 

While gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies are not on the [presumption] list, the GI tract and respiratory tract have similar embryonic origins (i.e., similar susceptibilities).  The primary difference would be routes of exposure, breathing vs. ingestion, so there may be a connection between Agent Orange (herbicide agent) and [the Veteran's] cancer. [...] 

The Board assigns significant probative value to Dr. B's opinion.  Even though Dr. B, as a researcher, could not established an irrefutable causative association between herbicide exposure and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, his explanation as to embryonic origins/similar susceptibilities suggests, at minimum, that there is a positive association, when considering the benefit of doubt.  Dr. B's reasoning, as already noted is replete with research-informed, and evidence-informed, and anatomy-informed reasoning.  Stated more directly, Dr. B presented a fulsome view of the complex interplay between herbicide exposure and similar embryonic origins oncological disease entities. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning); Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record).

The September 2024 VA nurse practitioner (NP) rendered a negative etiological opinion.  While the clinician provided an extensive chronology of the Veteran's cancer treatment and consultations, the clinician did not mention Dr. B's report of the important similar embryonic origins (i.e., similar susceptibilities) between presumptive cancers and herbicide exposure and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.  Considering the absence of this complex, relevant, oncological finding in the NP's opinion, the Board finds that this negative etiological opinion warrants diminished probative weight.  Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304; Acevedo, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294. 

Considering the above, the Board finds that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's metastatic cholangiocarcinoma was caused directly by exposure to an herbicide agent.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence of record must be resolved in the Veteran's favor, entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's metastatic cholangiocarcinoma is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Stroke and residual deficits

In an August 2024 VA examination report, a VA physician provided a diagnosis of status-post stroke with residual deficits.  Consequently, the current disability requirement has been met.

In the body of the examination report, the VA physician reported the following findings:

[S]troke is a multifactorial process involving multiple cascades and disease processes. Cerebral artery disease, atherosclerosis, and stroke can occur due to obesity, diet, genetics, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, exposure to chemicals etc.  

A review of the evidence of record reflects that the Veteran is service connected for hypertension and service connected for diabetes mellitus type 2 (and associated bilateral diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities, and-lastly-as of this Board decision, metastatic cholangiocarcinoma).  Thus, at least three of the multifactorial factors (cascades and disease factors) are service connected.

Even though the VA physician provided guidance as to the multifactorial process leading to a stroke, with specific identification of several diseases for which the Veteran is service connected, this physician rendered a negative etiological opinion.  As a rationale to support this negative opinion, the physician again recapitulated the Veteran's course of treatment and other, non-service connected disabilities as "causative factors", with minimal consideration of the contributory, multi-link causation roles that service connected hypertension, service connected for diabetes mellitus type 2 (and associated bilateral diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma assumed in the development/causation of the Veteran's stroke and residual deficits.  Consequently, the Board finds that this negative etiological opinion warrants diminished probative weight to the extent that its reasoning was flawed.  Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304; Acevedo, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294.  However, the opinion actually supports service connection, as service connection on a secondary or any other basis does not require a single cause and effect but only requires that one of the causes of the current disability be service or a service-connected disease or injury.  Campbell v. McDonough, No. 22-4537, 2023 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1498, *4-5 (Sept. 27, 2023) (mem dec) (Allen, J.) ("to establish a nexus, the law does not require military service to be the sole cause of the disability at issue, only that military service be at least as likely as not the cause of the disability"); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).  See also Spicer, 61 F. 4th at 1364 (discussing the broad nature of the general causation requirement for establishing service connection).

While the Board could remand for additional opinion, such a remand might well be interpreted as an attempt to develop evidence with the intent of denying the Veteran's service connection claim, especially in light of the VA physician's findings above (as to a multifactorial process involving multiple and disease processes).   Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021) ("Remand is inappropriate where the predominant purpose is not to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision unencumbered by error but to allow VA to obtain more evidence so that it can properly deny the claim").

Thus, the evidence discussed above suffices to decide this service connection claim, as it is least as likely as not that the Veteran's stroke and residual deficits were caused by the Veteran's service connected hypertension, service connected for diabetes mellitus type 2 (and associated bilateral diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and service connected metastatic cholangiocarcinoma in a multi-link chain).  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence of record must be resolved in the Veteran's favor, entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's stroke and residual deficits on a secondary, causation basis, is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
