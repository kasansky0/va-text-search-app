ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 23, 2022, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claim for service connection for tinnitus was denied in an October 20, 2015, rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal the decision, and the Veteran did not submit new and material evidence within one-year of the decision. 

2. On June 23, 2022, VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim Application for service connection for tinnitus.

3. No formal application to assert a claim for tinnitus was received after October 20, 2015, and prior to June 23, 2022.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The October 2015 rating decision denying service connection for tinnitus is final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c) (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103 (2015).

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to June 23, 2022, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from October 1971 to October 1973. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an October 2022 decision.  In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2022 decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

On the 10182, the Veteran's licensed attorney representative states the Veteran intends to submit additional argument. He has not done so. To the extent this was intended to be an extension request, no reasoning was given and it is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 23, 2022, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to June 23, 2022, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus.

Unless specifically provided otherwise in the statute, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim or supplemental claim for compensation benefits shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Effective date provisions regarding revision of a decision based on a supplemental claim or a higher-level review are governed by 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. For continuously pursued or supplemental claims, the effective dates are governed by 38?C.F.R. §?3.2500(h); but that is not the situation here. See also 38?C.F.R. § 3.2501. 

Retroactive effective dates are allowed, to a certain extent, in cases where an award or increase of compensation is granted pursuant to a liberalizing law. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a). However, no liberalizing law is applicable here. 

A claim, for VA compensation purposes, is broadly defined to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-5 (1998). Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. In addition, there is no provision in the law for awarding an earlier effective date for a grant of service connection based simply on the presence of the disability in treatment records. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998).

A claimant may indicate a desire to file a claim for benefits by filing an intent to file a claim to VA. Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by VA. If VA receives a complete application form within one year of the receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). However, the Board does not find an intent to file for this case.

In regard to the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statue or regulation. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ("Court") has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. This is determined on a "facts found" basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); see also McGrath v. Gober; 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). It is important to note that an effective date generally can be no earlier than the facts found. DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011). For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

Historically, on June 10, 2015, the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim was received by VA, which identified a claim of service connection for tinnitus.  An October 2015 rating decision denied service connection for the Veteran's claimed tinnitus.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and the Veteran did not submit new and material evidence within one-year of the decision.  The October 2015 rating decision became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c) (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103 (2015).

On June 23, 2022, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim Application seeking service connection for tinnitus. 

An October 2022 rating decision implicitly found that new and relevant evidence had been received to re-open the Veteran's claim and granted service connection for tinnitus and assigned an effective date of June 23, 2022.  The AOJ explained that the effective date of the grant of service connection was based on the date VA received the Veteran's claim.  Subsequently, in October 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review seeking readjudication of the October 2022 rating decision.  

In the February 2024 rating decision, the 10 percent evaluation for tinnitus effective June 23, 2022, was confirmed and continued.  The Veteran appealed the effective date of the award of service connection to the Board in a July 2024 Notice of Disagreement.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three elements: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after separation when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Turning to the record, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent as to any diagnosis or treatment for tinnitus during active service.  An October 1971 Report of Medical History from the time of enlistment reveals that the Veteran denied any ear trouble.

A VA examination from August 2015 is negative for a diagnosis of recurrent tinnitus.  The examiner noted that the Veteran reported experiencing ringing in his ears every six months for a few seconds and that these symptoms began in 1977 or 1978. 

In July 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination.  The examination report reveals a diagnosis of tinnitus. At the time of the examination, the examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was due to military noise exposure during active service. 

When granting entitlement to compensation for a disability in response to an application to reopen a claim that had previously been denied, VA cannot assign an effective date earlier than the date of receipt of the application of the supplemental claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (r) (effective date of reopened claim is date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later).

Here, after the most recent prior denial of his claim in the October 2015 rating decision, the Veteran did not submit a request to reopen the previously denied claim of service connection for tinnitus until June 23, 2022.  On that date, the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim for service connection for tinnitus was received.  Therefore, the earliest date of filing the claim is June 23, 2022. 

In sum, the effective date for the grant of service connection for tinnitus is the date of filing the claim, which is June 23, 2022. The Veteran's claim is denied.

In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the evidence weighs persuasively against the Veteran's claim, the doctrine is not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.
