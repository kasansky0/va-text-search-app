ORDER

Service connection for right ear hearing loss is granted.

Service connection for arthritis in multiple joints is denied.

REMAND

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left ear hearing loss is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is in approximate balance or greater that the Veteran's hearing loss, right ear, is etiologically related to his in-service exposure to hazardous noise. 

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that arthritis in multiple joints, began during active service, is presumptively related to service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for service connection for right ear hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

2.  The criteria for service connection for arthritis in multiple joints is not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Marine Corps from November 1978 to December 1982.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal that awarded service connection for left ear hearing loss and assigned a noncompensable raring well as the April 2024 rating decision on appeal that denied service connection for arthritis and right ear hearing loss. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal for each of the issues cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for chronic disabilities if such is shown to have been manifested to a compensable degree within one year after the Veteran was separated from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. If a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, then generally a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required for service connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.

To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must persuasively stand against a finding that the evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is granted.

The Veteran contends that he has right ear hearing loss related to his service, when he was exposed to flightline noise from aircraft noise and weapons fire while active duty.  

Sensorineural hearing loss is a "chronic disease" listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Thus, the presumptive service connection provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) apply in this portion of the appeal. Impaired hearing is considered a disability for VA purposes when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels (dB) or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran has been diagnosed with right ear hearing loss by VA standards on the October 2023 VA examination. 

Also, in the April 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ issued the following favorable findings: the Veteran had a high probability of noise exposure due to his military occupational specialty (MOS) of Helicopter Mechanic.  Hearing loss is a condition that the VA recognizes as an organic disease of the nervous system that may warrant service connection on a presumptive basis.  Participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded due to the Veteran having an MOS of Helicopter Mechanic with exposure to jet fuel, exhaust, cleaning chemicals, oil, degreasers, CARC paint. The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during  service.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The Board therefore finds that the first and second elements of service connection for hearing loss, right ear, the existence of a present disability and an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, have been met.

Regarding the nexus element of service connection, the October 2023 VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that right ear hearing loss was due to military noise exposure.  The examiner reasoned that there was no permanent threshold shift in hearing threshold from entrance to separation from service which is evidence of no permanent auditory damage on active duty.  Noise exposure was conceded and noised exposure causing auditory damage was well established, but auditory damage and hearing loss were not conceded based on noise alone.  There was no noise event to relate his current right ear hearing loss to his military noise exposure.  

In a February 20204 addendum, the VA examiner was asked to provide sufficient rational to support the negative medical opinion for right ear hearing loss indicating there was no significant threshold shift given that the May 1978 entrance examination showed 0 decibels at 2000 Hz and the October 1982 separation examination showed 15 decibels at 2000 Hz at separation. The examiner responded that if the hearing evaluations do not state that there has been a significant threshold shift for the Veteran then she does not call one frequency with a 15dB change a significant threshold shift (STS).  The examiner explained that STS refers to a change of more than 30 dB across the frequency ranges tested.  A change of 15 dB at one frequency would not be considered an STS while on active duty.  

However, a rationale for an examiner's opinion must not be based solely on the absence of treatment records during and after service. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007).  As a result, the October 2023 VA medical opinion regarding the Veteran's right ear hearing loss is inadequate.

Furthermore, the examiner did not appear to consider that a significant threshold shift in the right ear was indicated between the Veteran's May 1978 entrance audiogram and a February 1980 audiogram. More specifically, in May 1978, the Veteran's puretone thresholds in decibels were 10, 10, 0, 0, 5, and 0 at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz, respectively.  Whereas, in February 1980, puretone thresholds in decibels were 15, 5, 5, 5, 5, and 55 at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz, respectively.  The October 1982 separation examination puretone thresholds in decibels were 0, 15, 15, 15, 5, and 0 at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz, respectively. Following the examiners logic, there is a change of more than 55 decibels in the 6000 hertz frequency indicating an STS between the May 1978 entrance audiogram and the February 1980 audiogram and there was a change of 15 decibels in the 2000 and 3000 hertz frequencies between the May 1978 and October 1982 audiograms.  Although VA does not have a definition of significant threshold shift, both the Department of Defense and OSHA have defined "significant threshold shift (STS)" as a change in hearing threshold of an average of 10 dB or more. See e.g. Smith v. McDonough, No. 20-4332, 2022 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1010 (Vet. App. June 29, 2022).

Given that the VA examiner determined that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss was related to in-service noise exposure as an aircraft mechanic because he had a significant shift in thresholds during his time in service, it follows that the Veterans right ear hearing loss would also be related to in-service noise exposure as an aircraft mechanic because of a significant shift in thresholds during his time in service.  The Board therefore finds that the evidence is in approximate balance or greater that the Veteran's hearing loss, right ear is etiologically related to his active-duty service. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).  

Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for hearing loss, right ear is warranted and the claim for entitlement to service connection for hearing loss, right ear is granted. In implementing the Board's grant of service connection for right ear hearing loss, the AOJ will rate the Veteran's now service-connected bilateral hearing loss in the first instance. 

Entitlement to service connection for arthritis in multiple joints is denied.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for arthritis in multiple joints. See VA 21-526EZ received September 2023.  The Veteran had also filed a claim at the same time in September 2023 for lower back pain.  A VA examination revealed that he had lumbosacral strain, degenerative arthritis, and degenerative disc disease for which service connection was granted in the February 2024 rating decision.  Therefore, the Board will consider whether or not service connection is warranted for arthritis in multiple joints other than his already service connected lumbar spine.

Prior to the decision on appeal, the Veteran was sent a letter requesting what joint or joints and what location or locations that the Veteran was claiming for arthritis. See February 2024 Subsequent Development Letter. Also, a February 2024 report of general information revealed that an attempt was made to clarify arthritis locations by calling the Veteran, but he was unreachable. 

The records prior to the decision on appeal do not contain any responses from the Veteran as to what joint, joints, or locations he was claiming arthritis.

As to presumptive service connection, the Board finds that records do not show that the Veteran had arthritis in any of his joints during service. His exit examination also does not report complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to arthritis in any joints. Additionally, there are no records prior to the decision on appeal that show continuous symptoms since service. Therefore, the Board denies presumptive service connection for this condition.

However, the Board also considered direct service connection. After considering all the evidence presented during the relevant periods, the Board finds that the evidence weighs against service connection for the Veteran's claim for arthritis of multiple joints.

The Board finds that a link to service for arthritis of multiple joints is not supported at this time. In making this finding, the Board notes that at the time of the decision on appeal, the evidence did not support the need for an opinion and the duty to assist the Veteran in obtaining an opinion ends at the time of the decision on appeal.

The VA must provide an examination when there is: (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies; (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for VA to make a decision on the claim. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i) (2018).

Here, the Veteran submitted his claim alleging that he has arthritis in multiple joints.  He did not identify any treatment records regarding complaints, treatment, or diagnoses of arthritis in multiple joints and a search in CAPRI revealed that no progress notes were found in the VA system. This first requirement of the McLendon analysis has not been satisfied, competent evidence of a current disability.

Furthermore, he failed to provide other statements or evidence that might provide an association between an event, injury, or illness in service and its relationships to his claim current conditions. Also, service treatment records including his separation examination were negative for any complaints, treatment, diagnosis, events, injuries, or illnesses related to arthritis in multiple joints. Therefore, the second requirement of the McLendon analysis had not been satisfied at any prior to the adjudication of the Veteran's claimed condition. 

Reviewing all the evidence prior to the decision on appeal, the Board finds that there was not yet an indication that the general disability of arthritis in multiple joints may be associated with the Veteran's service, to satisfy the third requirement of the McLendon analysis.

Therefore, the Board finds that prior to the decision on appeal the requirements of the McLendon analysis were not satisfied and the VA was not required to provide a competent medical opinion.

While the Veteran may claim that he has arthritis in multiple joints related to his service, the record still does not contain any opinions linking his arthritis of multiple joints to service. The Veteran's mere contentions does not meet the level needed to grant presumptive service connection since there is no evidence to support the Veteran's contentions.  

Additionally, the Veteran has a duty to assist and cooperate with VA in developing evidence - the duty to assist is not a one-way street. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991).

The Board recognizes that the Veteran might sincerely believe his arthritis of the feet or other arthritis is related to his active service in some way.

While the Veteran may believe that his current symptoms are related to service, as a lay person, the Veteran has not shown that he has specialized training sufficient to render such an opinion. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting general competence to testify as to symptoms but not to provide medical diagnosis). In this regard, the diagnosis and etiology of the Veteran's arthritis in multiple joints is a matter not capable of lay observation and requires medical expertise to determine. Accordingly, his opinion as to the etiology of his current symptoms is not competent medical evidence.

The Veteran's file does not contain any other evidence that supports a nexus between his claimed arthritis in multiple joints and his active service. In the absence of any such evidence, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for service connection.

The criteria for service connection for arthritis in multiple joints have not been met, and the claim is denied. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for arthritis of multiple joints is not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS AND BASES FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left ear hearing loss is remanded.

The Board's current decision grants service connection for right ear hearing loss. This decision impacts the resolution of the left ear hearing loss increased rating claim, as right ear and left ear hearing loss are rated together. Thus, the RO must first implement the Board's above grant of service connection for right ear hearing loss. Thereafter, the RO should adjudicate the combined bilateral hearing loss claim, including assigning an initial rating based on the evidence of record.
