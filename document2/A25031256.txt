ORDER

Entitlement to basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (known as Chapter 33 or the Post-9/11 GI Bill), is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

1. The Veteran attended and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, after which he was commissioned as an officer in the Regular Navy.

2. The evidence fails to reflect that, for purposes of establishing entitlement to Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits, the Veteran had any periods of qualifying active duty service after September 10, 2011.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for basic eligibility for entitlement to Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3301, 3311; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.9505, 21.9520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from May 2012 to August 2016, after which he was transferred to the Temporary Disabled Retired List.

This appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arose from a September 2018 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) determination that the Veteran did not meet the basic eligibility requirements for entitlement to Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits.  Specifically, it was determined that the Veteran's service May 29, 2012, through August 28, 2016, was not qualifying active duty service for purposes of entitlement to Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits because it was service obligated due having been commissioned as on Officer after graduating from a service academy.  The Veteran disagreed with that decision and a statement of case (SOC) was issued on September 20, 2019.

On October 17, 2019, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), in which opted in to the then-new Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) review system.  The Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  On February 5, 2024, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2020 SOC, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran, or his representative, within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the September 2020 SOC and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Basic Eligibility for the Post-9/11 GI Bill

Relevant to the instant claim, the Post 9/11 GI Bill provides for VA educational assistance for members of the Armed Forces based on active duty service after September 10, 2001.  For members of the regular components of the Armed Forces, qualifying active duty service is full-time duty other than active duty for training.  38 U.S.C. § 3301(1)(A).  For members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces, qualifying active duty includes service on active duty under a call or order to active duty under 10 U.S.C. §§ 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304, or under 14 U.S.C. § 712 (redesignated as 14 U.S.C. § 3713).  See 38 U.S.C. § 3301(1)(B).

Furthermore, 38 C.F.R. § 21.9505 provides that for the purposes of this subpart (governing the administration and payment of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill)), the following definitions apply: Active duty means full-time duty in the regular components of the Armed Forces or under a call or order to active duty under 10 U.S.C. 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304.  Active duty does not include: (1) Full-time National Guard Duty performed under 32 U.S.C. orders; (2) Any period during which the individual (i) was assigned full-time by the Armed Forces to a civilian institution to pursue a program of education that was substantially the same as programs of education offered to civilians; (ii) served as a cadet or midshipmen at one of the service academies; or (iii) served under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. § 12103(d) pursuant to an enlistment in the Army National Guard, Air National Guard, Army Reserve, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, or Coast Guard Reserve; (3) A period of service (i) required by an officer pursuant to an agreement under 10 U.S.C. 2107(b); (ii) required by an officer pursuant to an agreement under 10 U.S.C. 4348, 6959, or 9348; (iii) that was terminated because the individual is considered a minor by the Armed Forces, was erroneously enlisted, or received a defective enlistment agreement; or (iv) counted for purposes of repayment of an education loan under 10 U.S.C. Chapter 109; or (4) A period of Selected Reserve service used to establish eligibility under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 30 or 10 U.S.C. Chapter 1606 or 1607.  38 U.S.C. § 3301; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9505. 

Regarding the Veteran's period of active duty from May 2012 to August 2016, the evidence shows that Veteran attended the U.S. Naval Academy from July 2008 to May 2012 and incurred a service obligation of five years upon graduation.  As noted above, a period of service required by an officer pursuant to an agreement under 10 U.S.C. § 6959, which states that a midshipman, upon graduation from the Naval Academy, "will accept an appointment, if tendered, as a commissioned officer of the Regular Navy . . . and will serve on active duty for at least five years immediately after such appointment", is not included in the definition of active duty for purposes of establishing eligibility for, and entitlement to, Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.  38 C.F.R. § 21.9505.

In September 2018, the RO inquired with the Department of Defense (DoD) as to whether the Veteran was commissioned upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy and what his obligated service was, noting that the service dates provided in Veterans Information System showed an obligated service period from May 29, 2012, to May 29, 2017, but that the Veteran was released from active duty on August 28, 2016.  Internal communications between VA employees then show a difference of opinion regarding whether, because the Veteran was released from active duty with a service-connected disability, he would be eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits despite the entirety of his service being obligated service.  The RO ultimately determined that the Veteran could not be approved for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits in September 2018 because "[t]ime served fulfilling [his] active duty service obligation for the Service Academy cannot be counted towards Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility."

In disagreeing with that determination, the Veteran noted that he had been honorably discharged after being placed on Temporary Disabled Retired List due to no fault of his own with a non-stabilized medical issue.  In support of this, the Veteran submitted a memorandum from the Navy Personnel Command, dated October 10, 2018, showing that he had been discharged from the Navy by reason of physical disability with severance pay, effective October 10, 2018.  The memorandum stated: "This discharge serves not only to terminate your commission but also any additional service obligations which may have been incurred pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 651."  Based on this memorandum, the RO, in a July 2019 decision, determined that the Veteran was in fact eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.

Then, in August 2019, the RO submitted another inquiry to DoD, noting that DoD records were showing an obligated period of service, but that the October 2018 memorandum indicated that the Veteran's commission terminated, as well as any service obligation, due to the Veteran's disability discharge.  The RO specifically asked whether the service obligation and commission were retroactively terminated.  In September 2019, DoD responded that the Veteran was commissioned after graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy and incurred a service obligation from May 29, 2012, to May 28, 2017.  A September 2019 VA/DOD Identity Repository (VADIR) database report similarly reflects the Veteran's obligated service period as being from May 29, 2012, to May 28, 2017.

On September 20, 2019, the RO sent to the Veteran a letter informing his that his claim for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits could not be approved because he had insufficient qualifying active duty service after September 10, 2011.  That same day, the RO issued an SOC in which it determined that the denial of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits was appropriate based on information received from DoD.

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's period of service from May 29, 2012, to August 28, 2016, is not active duty service for the purpose of establishing eligibility to educational assistance under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.  This is so because that period of service was obligated service as a result of the Veteran having been commissioned after attending the U.S. Naval Academy.  The Board understands that the October 2018 memorandum from the Navy Personnel Command indicates that the Veteran's discharge served to terminate his commission, as well as any additional service obligations which may have been incurred pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 651.  In this regard, the Board points out that the Veteran's service obligation at issue was not incurred pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 651, which provided that "[e]ach person who becomes a member of an armed force, . . . shall serve in the armed forces for a total initial period of not less than six years nor more than eight years."  Further, the termination of the Veteran's commission did not serve to remove that service obligation he incurred when he accepted the commission, as verified by DoD.  

The Board also understands the confusion created due to the RO's determination that the Veteran was eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, only to again deem him ineligible just two months later, and the Board apologizes to the Veteran for the confusion this has caused.  Unfortunately, however, because the Veteran's obligated service is specifically excluded from the definition of "active duty" as it pertains to Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility, and because the record also fails to reflect any additional period of active duty service after September 10, 2001, the Board has no choice but to find that the Veteran is not eligible for educational assistance benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and his claim must be denied on that basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 20.9505.

In so finding, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that he was discharged from the Navy due to disability prior to being able to complete his period of obligated service.  In this regard, the Board acknowledges that the 38 U.S.C. § 3311 provides that an individual who serves at least 30 continuous days on active duty on or after September 11, 2001, and is subsequently discharged or released from active duty for a service-connected disability is entitled to educational assistance under Chapter 33.  However, because the pertinent regulation specifically excludes that the Veteran's type of active duty (i.e. that which is obligated due to having been commissioned as on Officer after graduating from a service academy) from the definition of active duty for purposes of eligibility for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, the fact that the Veteran was discharged due to disability has no bearing on the outcome of this appeal.

While the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran and understands that he may believe he is entitled to Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits, the Board is bound by the laws and regulations that apply to Veterans claims.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.5, 20.101(a).  Those laws and regulations reflect that there is no legal basis on which the Veteran's claim can be granted.  As the law and not the evidence is dispositive in this case, the claim must be denied as a matter of law.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
