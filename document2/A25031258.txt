ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for a heart disability is dismissed.

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for stroke and its residuals, to include are secondary to a heart disability, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In August 2024, the Veteran died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1969 to March 1972.  He served honorably in the U.S. Army, including service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era.  The Board is thankful for his service to our country.  

The matters of entitlement to service connection for a heart disability and stroke and its residuals are on appeal from a December 2021 decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claims at this time and must dismiss this appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim(s).  This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

The AOJ must decide all requests for substitution in the first instance. 38?C.F.R. §?3.1010(e)(1).  In September 2024, VA received a request for substitution through a VA form 21-534EZ, Application for DIC, survivors pension, and/or accrued benefits.  To date, the AOJ has not ruled on that request.  If the request for substitution is granted, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket.  38 C.F.R. §?20.1302(a).
