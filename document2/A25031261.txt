ORDER

An initial compensable rating for hypertension is denied.

REMANDED

An initial rating in excess of 30 percent for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease /obstructive lung disease (COPD) is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more requiring continuous medication for control.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (Code) 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1966 to August 1970, to include service in Thailand.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) thanks the Veteran for his honorable service to our country.

The April 2024 rating decision on appeal, which assigned an initial noncompensable rating for hypertension, was issued by the regional office/agency of original jurisdiction (RO/AOJ) on May 3, 2024.  The June 2024 rating decision on appeal, which assigned an initial 30 percent rating for COPD, was issued by the AOJ on June 18, 2024.  As these are initial decisions, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket and limited his appeal to the "evaluation" (or ratings) of the disabilities, arguing that VA failed "to properly rate" the claims.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 3, 2024, and June 18, 2024, notices of the decisions on appeal which respect to each issue, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

The Board is cognizant of the decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  There, the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  In the present case, the Veteran submitted evidence in support of his appeal within 90 days following the receipt of his VA Form 10182, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  As such, a docket switch is no longer possible.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) ("Requests to modify a Notice of Disagreement will not be granted if the appellant has submitted evidence or testimony as described in 20.302 and 20.303.").  Under the circumstances, the Board may proceed with adjudication of the Veteran's appeal without further delay.

As to the claim for a higher initial rating for hypertension, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim for a higher initial rating for COPD, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are based on a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries.  The ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).

In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  Where the question is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, consideration of the medical evidence since the effective date of the award of service connection is required.  Fenderson, at 126.  Where the question is the propriety of a non-initial evaluation, consideration of the evidence up to one year prior to the filing of the claim is appropriate.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

In McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28 (2000), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that when evidence is created is irrelevant compared to when the Veteran was actually experiencing the symptoms.  Thus, the Board will consider whether the evidence suggests that the severity of the Veteran's symptoms increased sometime prior to the date of the examination reports.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension is denied.  

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an initial compensable rating for hypertension.  The period on appeal runs from August 10, 2022, the effective date of service connection for hypertension, to May 3, 2024, the notification date of the rating decision on appeal.  The Veteran has advanced no specific argument as to why a compensable rating is warranted.  

The Veteran's service-connected hypertension is currently rated as zero percent disabling under Code 7101.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104.  Code 7101 provides a 10 percent disability evaluation when diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressure is predominantly 160 or more, or the individual has a history of diastolic pressure of 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent disability evaluation is warranted when diastolic pressure is predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure is predominantly 200 or more.  A 40 percent evaluation is warranted where diastolic pressure is predominantly 120 or more, and a 60 percent evaluation is warranted where diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 130 or more.  With regard to a 10 percent rating, "[t]he plain text of Code 7101 directs VA to consider historical, rather than current, blood pressure readings and that the relevant 'historical blood pressure readings' are those taken before the veteran began medication."  Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75, 76 (2021).

There are three notes to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Code 7101.  Note (1) provides that hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days.  For purposes of this section, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure (i.e., bottom number) is predominantly 90 mm or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means the systolic blood pressure (i.e., top number) is predominantly 160 mm or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm.  Note (2) requires the evaluation of hypertension due to aortic insufficiency or hyperthyroidism, which is usually the isolated systolic type, as part of the condition causing it rather than by a separate evaluation.  Note (3) states that hypertension should be evaluated separately from hypertensive heart disease and other types of heart disease.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria.  Predominantly means "being most frequent or common."  See Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant (last accessed April 3, 2025).  In the context of Code 7101, this means "above a certain level more often than it was below it."  See Thompkins v. McDonald, No. 15-4128, 2016 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 2013 (Dec. 29, 2016) (Greenberg, J.) (accepting this definition of predominant in the Board's decision and affirming based on the Board's application of the definition to the facts of that case); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).

The Board notes that, because Code 7101 lists "continuous medication for control" as a criterion in the 10 percent rating, the Code, when read as a whole, contemplates the effects of medication in assigning a disability evaluation.  McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 272-73 (2016).

A February 2024 VA Hypertension examination report presents three blood pressure readings of "169/93" and "175/93" taken on February 1, 2024 and "132/72" taken on November 22, 2023.  It is noted the Veteran treatment plan included taking medication, Diovan, twice daily.  The examiner noted review of the Veteran's claims file and stated that the Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more.  The Veteran also had no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs or symptoms related to his hypertension and his hypertension had no functional impact on his ability to work.  The Board finds this examination to be adequate for rating purposes.  It was in-person and contains sufficient detail (specifically the blood pressure readings) as well as an assessment of the Veteran's historical blood pressure readings.  

Although the VA examination report notes 2 systolic reading above 160 on February 1, 2024; review of the Veteran's VA treatment during the appeal period shows his systolic blood pressure readings were not predominantly 160 or more.  Specifically, these records show readings of 137/87 on September 26, 2023; 155/87, 134/75, and 146/80 on September 16, 2023; 135/74 on September 15, 2023; 142/76, 146/79 and 173/85 on September 14, 2023; 136/78 on March 13, 2023, 153/84 on October 12, 2022; and 146/87 and 162/79 on September 21, 2022.  With the exception of systolic readings above 160 noted on February 1, 2024, September 14, 2023, and September 21, 2022; the remaining treatment records do not show diastolic pressure of 100 or more, or; systolic pressure 160 or more; or a history of diastolic pressure of 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control.  Therefore, the Board cannot conclude that the Veteran's rating for hypertension is compensable under Code 7101 at any time during the appeal period.

On review, the Board finds that the criteria for a compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected hypertension are not met.  The medical evidence shows that the Veteran has been prescribed medication for hypertension and continuous medication is needed for control, however, there is no showing of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, including historically.  In so finding, the Board has considered all instances of documented blood pressure readings.  The blood pressure readings are sufficient for making an increased rating determination even considering the Veteran's use of medications to control his blood pressure.  See McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267. 276-77 (2016) (the Board may properly consider ameliorative effects of blood pressure medication in adjudicating claims for increased ratings for hypertension, because medication is specifically mentioned in Code 7101).

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertion that an initial compensable rating for his hypertension is warranted.  The Veteran is competent to report any observable hypertensive symptoms, he is not competent to assess the severity of his symptomatology in accordance with the rating criteria.  See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007).  The criteria for an increased rating are set by specific numerical values and the medical evidence does not support a higher rating.

The evidence is persuasively against the claim for a compensable rating for hypertension.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable, and a compensable rating for hypertension is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

Beyond what is addressed elsewhere in this decision, neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues arising from this rating matter, nor have any other associated issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for COPD is remanded.

The appeal period for consideration for the Veteran's COPD increased initial rating claim is from August 10, 2022, the effective date of service connection, to June 18, 2024, the notification date of the rating decision on appeal.  

The Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error exists as to this claim, as prior to the June 2024 rating decision on appeal, additional outstanding potentially relevant medical records, through a community care provider, were identified by the record.  Specifically, a September 2023 VA treatment record shows the Veteran had had been approved for community care pulmonology referral for COPD.  These records show the community care provider was Dr. C.B. of Pulmonary Critical Care Sleep Disorder Medicine in Pensacola, Florida.  These records also show the Veteran was followed by and had been prescribed medication by the community care provider.  When reference is made to pertinent medical records, VA is on notice of their existence and has a duty to assist the claimant in attempting to obtain them.  Therefore, due to this duty to assist error, remand is required to allow VA to request any relevant records from Dr. C.B., through community care via the VHA Choice program, as these records are potentially relevant to this claim.  The Veteran may also submit these records to VA.

The Board also advises that, at this time, it intimates no opinion as to the credibility or probative value of any lay statements in relation to the Veteran's claim and defers any credibility determinations until final adjudication of this claim.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Please obtain and associate with the Veteran's claims file all records relevant to treatment of his COPD conducted by a community care provider through the VA Choice program, including records from Dr. Charles Bryan of Pulmonary Critical Care Sleep Disorder Medicine in Pensacola, Florida, identified in September 2023 VA medical records; if a release form is needed to request any records, ask the Veteran to complete such form.  Please also advise the Veteran that he may associate these records with his VA benefits file himself.
