2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC Chapter 35 have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1991 to April 1994.

This appeal comes before the Board from a June 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement appealing a March 2024 rating decision.

1. The claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of individual unemployability

2. The claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC Chapter 35

By way of history, the Veteran filed a claim for TDIU in October 2017. That claim was granted in a February 2018 rating decision, with an effective date of October 10, 2017. The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement in April 2018, challenging the effective date. In January 2019, he opted the claims into the AMA review system by submitting a Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) election form. A RAMP rating decision was issued in August 2019, which the Veteran appealed to the Board. A Board decision was issued in June 2020, and a rating decision was issued in July 2020 implementing that decision. 

In November 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review of the July 2020 rating decision. A rating decision was issued in March 2021. The Veteran filed an NOD in April 2021, selecting direct review by the Board. 

In June 2021, the Veteran filed an appeal of the June 2020 Board decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). The Court issued a decision remanding the matters to the Board in December 2021. The Board subsequently remanded the issues in a September 2022 decision. A rating decision was issued in March 2024, which led to the June 2024 NOD this appeal stream stems from. 

At the time of the Veteran's June 2024 VA Form 10182, the claim for an earlier effective date for TDIU and DEA benefits was already pending before the Board under another docket, stemming from the April 2021 VA Form 10182. That docket was adjudicated by the Board, and the issues were remanded, in July 2024. 

The Veteran's June 2024 NOD constitutes an impermissible concurrent review. Thus, this appeal stream must be dismissed due to procedural error. 

Under the Appeals Modernization Act, concurrent or duplicate election is prohibited, meaning that once a claimant has filed for review through one option (i.e., higher-level review, supplemental claim, Board review), he cannot seek review under a different one, or in multiple ones, while that review is pending final adjudication. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b). Here, the Veteran sought concurrent and duplicate review of the same issue.

Accordingly, this appeal was improperly docketed at the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), and the appropriate remedy is to dismiss the appeal due to procedural error. Id.; see Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021) (The Board may not dismiss an improperly docketed appeal for lack of jurisdiction but is not precluded from dismissing it for other non-jurisdictional reasons such as a procedural defect-a violation of the claims processing rules).

Again, the Board notes that the Veteran's claim has been addressed in a separate July 2024 Board decision based upon the previously filed appeal stream.
