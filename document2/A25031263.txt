ORDER

Readjudication of the claim of service connection for cervical spine degenerative arthritis, based on the submission of new and relevant evidence, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

By letter dated in December 2022, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran withdrew his claim for readjudication of the claim of service connection for cervical spine degenerative arthritis. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met as to the issue of readjudication of the claim of service connection for cervical spine degenerative arthritis.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2), (d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service from June 2006 to May 2007.   

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2022 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In January 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested review of a December 2021 rating decision that denied the claim on appeal.  In February 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received and readjudication of the claim was denied. 

In the February 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

Withdrawal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id. 

By letter dated December 2022, the Veteran's attorney indicated that the Veteran was withdrawing his claim for service connection for cervical spine degenerative arthritis. This withdraw was in writing, included the name of the Veteran, the file number, a statement that the appeal was withdrawn and was specific as to which issue was withdrawn. See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020).  The withdrawal was effective immediately upon receipt by VA. 38 C.F.R. §20.204(b)(3).  As there remains no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration regarding the above-mentioned issue, the Board does not have jurisdiction over the issue, it is dismissed.
