FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The January 2021 rating decision deferred decisions on the issues of entitlement to compensation for bronchitis, shortness of breath, and Tietze syndrome, and headaches, migraines; therefore, the rating decision did not constitute a final, appealable decision as to those claims.

2. In September 2022 and February 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on active duty from June 1999 to February 2008.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a January 2021 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In September 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) and requested a hearing before the Board.  A Board hearing was scheduled for April 2025.  However, as discussed below, the Veteran withdrew his appeal prior to the scheduled hearing.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2021 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the RO issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As an aside, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran has another pending appeal regarding eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA).  That appeal will be addressed in a separate decision.

1. The appeal seeking compensation for bronchitis, shortness of breath, and Tietze syndrome

2. The appeal seeking compensation for headaches, migraines

An appeal may be initiated only once a decision is made by an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  Actions by the AOJ to defer a decision are not appealable decisions.  See Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 462 (2011) ("Because there is no 'final decision' when the RO issues a deferred rating decision, there has been no 'adjudicative determination' from which [a] [Notice of Disagreement] can be filed.").  The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).  

In the January 2021 rating decision on appeal, the RO deferred decisions on the issues of entitlement to compensation for: (1) bronchitis, shortness of breath, and Tietze syndrome; and (2) headaches, migraines.  The RO noted that further development would be undertaken on these claims.  This rating decision, which only advised the Veteran of future action to be taken by the RO, is not a final, appealable decision as to the claims for service connection for bronchitis, shortness of breath, and Tietze syndrome and headaches, migraines.  Therefore, it was an administrative error for the Board to accept the September 2021 VA Form 10182 as to these issues.  Accordingly, the appeals as to these issues must be dismissed as a matter of law.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500; Shipley, 24 Vet. App. at 462.

As an aside, the Board notes that in a March 2021 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for migraine including migraine variants and assigned an initial disability rating of 50 percent, effective June 8, 2020.  Additionally, in a January 2022 rating decision (of which the Veteran was notified in February 2022), the RO granted service connection for bronchitis with shortness of breath and assigned an initial disability rating of 10 percent, effective June 8, 2020.  The RO also denied entitlement to service connection for costochondritis (claimed as Tietze syndrome) in that decision.

4. The appeal seeking service connection for hypothyroidism

5. The appeal seeking service connection for a left hand condition

6. The appeal seeking service connection for a left knee condition

7. The appeal seeking service connection for a left shoulder condition

8. The appeal seeking service connection for a left testicular condition

9. The appeal seeking service connection for PTSD, major depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, memory loss and stress disorder

10. The appeal seeking service connection for restless leg syndrome

11. The appeal seeking service connection for a right ankle condition

12. The appeal seeking service connection for a right foot, heel condition

13. The appeal seeking service connection for a right hand condition

14. The appeal seeking service connection for a right shoulder condition

15. The appeal seeking service connection for a right knee condition

16. The appeal seeking service connection for a right wrist condition

18. The appeal seeking service connection for tuberculosis

19. The appeal seeking service connection for an upper back, neck condition

20. The appeal regarding the Veteran's service-connected sinusitis

21. The appeal regarding the Veteran's service-connected TBI

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  In Hembree v. Wilkie, the United States Court of Appeals for of Veterans Claims held that written withdrawals of an appeal are governed by the applicable regulations instead of DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011) (requiring a withdrawal to be explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences).  See 33 Vet. App. 1,7 (2020).  As this case is governed by the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the applicable regulation is 38 C.F.R. § 20.205, which requires that the withdrawal includes the name of the appellant and the file number.  Additionally, the veteran or representative must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(c), withdrawal of an appeal will be deemed a withdrawal of the Notice of Disagreement as to all issues to which the withdrawal applies.

Here, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, initially requested withdrawal of the instant appeal before the Board in September 2022.  See September 2022 "Third Party Correspondence."  The Veteran reiterated his request to withdraw the appeal in February 2025.  See February 2025 "Third Party Correspondence."  The written withdrawals include the Veteran's name, file number, and Board docket number, and requested that all 21 issues on appeal be withdrawn.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's written withdrawals of the appeal are valid.

As there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration regarding this claim, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
