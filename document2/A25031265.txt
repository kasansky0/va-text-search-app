ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability rating of 30 percent, but not higher, for chronic bronchitis associated with emphysema is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's chronic bronchitis associated with emphysema is manifested by a post-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV-1) of 68-percent predicted; it does not more nearly approximate FEV-1 of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or FEV-1 to Forced Vital Capacity (FEV-1/FVC) of 40 to 55 percent, or Diffusion Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide by the Single Breath Method (DLCO (SB)) of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or maximum oxygen consumption of 15 to 20 milliliters of oxygen consumed in a minute per kilogram of body weight (ml/kg/min) (with cardiorespiratory limit) at any time during the appeal period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial disability rating of 30 percent, but not higher, for chronic bronchitis associated with emphysema have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.27, 4.96, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6600.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1967 to November 1968.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a September 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on February 11, 2025; a transcript is of record.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of September 2024 supplemental claim decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. §?20.302.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the September 2024 rating decision and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107; 38 C.F.R. § 20.800.

Entitlement to an initial disability rating of 30 percent, but not higher, for chronic bronchitis associated with emphysema is granted.

The Veteran disagrees with his initial noncompensable rating for chronic bronchitis associated with emphysema, effective July 26, 2023, which was assigned in the September 2024 rating decision.  See November 2024 VA Form 10182.  

Ratings are based on a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  The ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations.  Id.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When, after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.  

The Veteran's chronic bronchitis has been rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6600, for the entire rating period ending on the date of the September 2024 rating decision.  The Board notes that the Veteran has a separate diagnosis for emphysema, which may be rated under DC 6603.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.  However, as DC 6600 and DC 6603 are coexisting respiratory conditions, they cannot be combined with each other; as such, the Veteran has been assigned a single rating under the DC which reflects his predominant disability of chronic bronchitis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(a).  Further, as DC 6600 and DC 6603 are rated under the same criteria, the Veteran's rating would not change, regardless of the DC assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.      

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6600, chronic bronchitis is rated as follows: a 10 percent rating is warranted when pulmonary function tests (PFTs) show an FEV-1 of 71- to 80-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent, or DLCO (SB) 66- to 80-percent predicted; a 30 percent rating is warranted when PFTs show an FEV-1 of 56- to 70-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or DLCO (SB) 56- to 65-percent predicted; a 60 percent rating is warranted when PFTs show an FEV-1 of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or DLCO (SB) of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or maximum oxygen consumption of 15 to 20 ml/kg/min (with cardiorespiratory limit); and a 100 percent rating is warranted when PFTs show FEV-1 less than 40 percent of predicted value, or FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, or DLCO (SB) less than 40-percent predicted, or maximum exercise capacity less than 15 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption (with cardiac or respiratory limitation), or cor pulmonale (right heart failure), or right ventricular hypertrophy, or pulmonary hypertension (shown by Echo or cardiac catheterization), or episode(s) of acute respiratory failure, or requires outpatient oxygen therapy.

PFTs are required to evaluate chronic bronchitis (DC 6600) except when the results of a maximum exercise capacity test are of record and are 20 ml/kg/min or less (if a maximum exercise capacity test is not of record, alternative criteria should be used); when pulmonary hypertension (documented by an echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization), cor pulmonale, or right ventricular hypertrophy has been diagnosed; when there have been one or more episodes of acute respiratory failure; or when outpatient oxygen therapy is required.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d).

If the DLCO (SB) test is not of record, evaluation should be based on alternative criteria as long as the examiner states why the test would not be useful or valid in a particular case.  Id.  When the PFTs are not consistent with clinical findings, the examiner should evaluate based on the PFTs or state why PFTs are not a valid indication of respiratory functional impairment in a particular case.  Id.

Post-bronchodilator studies are required when PFTs are done for disability evaluation purposes except when the results of pre-bronchodilator pulmonary function tests are normal or when the examiner determines that post-bronchodilator studies should not be done and states why.  Id.  When evaluating based on PFTs, post-bronchodilator results must be used in applying the evaluation criteria in the rating schedule unless the post-bronchodilator results were poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results; in those cases, pre-bronchodilator values are used for rating purposes.  Id.

When there is a disparity between the results of different PFTs (FEV-1, FVC, etc.) so that the level of evaluation would differ depending on which test result is used, the test result that the examiner states most accurately reflects the level of disability is used.  Id.  If the FEV-1 and the FVC are both greater than 100 percent, a compensable evaluation based on a decreased FEV-1/FVC ratio is not assigned.  Id.

A September 2023 VA examination confirmed the Veteran's diagnoses for chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and the examiner noted that his respiratory condition did not require the use of oral or parenteral corticosteroid medications, antibiotics, or oxygen therapy but did require daily use of inhalational bronchodilator therapy and oral bronchodilators.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's FEV-1 test results most accurately reflect his level of disability, and PFT testing performed on August 28, 2023, reflected pre-bronchodilator values as follows:  FVC at 99 percent of the predicted value, FEV-1 at 61 percent of the predicted value, and FEV-1/FVC at 59 percent of the predicted value.  His post-bronchodilator values were as follows:  FVC at 106 percent of the predicted value, FEV-1 at 68 percent of the predicted value, and FEV-1/FVC at 64 percent of the predicted value.  DLCO (SB) testing and exercise capacity testing were not indicated.  

A June 2024 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's respiratory condition did not require the use of oral bronchodilators or oxygen therapy, but did require intermittent use of oral or parenteral corticosteroid medications, daily use of inhaled medication, and use of antibiotics.  However, a September 2024 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's respiratory condition did not require the use of oral or parenteral corticosteroid medications, oral bronchodilators, antibiotics, or oxygen therapy, but did require daily use of inhaled medication.  Both the June 2024 and September 2024 VA examiners noted the same PFT test results from August 28, 2023.  At the February 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran confirmed his use of daily inhaled medications and that his last VA examination was accurate.  

The Board notes that the Veteran also submitted a January 2025 private spirometry report with PFT test results within the 90-day evidence window following the February 2025 Board hearing.  38 C.F.R. §?20.302.  However, as the PFT test performed on January 14, 2025, did not include any post-bronchodilator studies and the private treatment provider did not discuss why such studies should not be done, the January 2025 private spirometry report cannot be used for rating purposes.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d).  

All three VA examiners of record, including the most recent September 2024 VA examiner, indicate that the August 2023 FEV-1 result most accurately reflects the Veteran's condition, and as such, his chronic bronchitis is manifested by a post-bronchodilator FEV-1 of 68-percent predicted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(6).  Additionally, the post-bronchodilator FEV-1 result of 68-percent predicted is better than the pre-bronchodilator FEV-1 result of 61-percent predicted, and as such, the post-bronchodilator FEV-1 result must be used for evaluation purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(5).  Consequently, a rating of 30 percent for the Veteran's chronic bronchitis associated with emphysema is appropriate.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6600

The Board finds that the Veteran's chronic bronchitis does not more nearly approximate an FEV-1 of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or DLCO (SB) of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or maximum oxygen consumption of 15 to 20 ml/kg/min (with cardiorespiratory limit).  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6600. As the Veteran's post-bronchodilator FEV-1 result is 68-percent predicted and there are no additional respiratory findings or other relevant evidence in the Veteran's file that the Board may consider at this time, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.97, DC 6600; 20.301.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to report lay statements regarding his worsening symptoms of chronic bronchitis associated with emphysema.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994).  However, the Veteran is not competent to determine the clinical severity of his respiratory disabilities, as the record does not reflect that he has sufficient knowledge to interpret such complex medical testing.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307-08 (2007).  The medical findings provided in conjunction with the VA examinations of record were made by medical professionals, and directly address the criteria under which the Veteran's disabilities are rated; as such, the Board finds that medical evidence is more probative than the Veteran's lay statements.  King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2012).

In light of the above, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of an initial disability rating of 30 percent, but not higher, for the Veteran's service-connected chronic bronchitis associated with emphysema.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
