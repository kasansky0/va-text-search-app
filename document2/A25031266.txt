FINDING OF FACT

On March 27, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this entire appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal/dismissal of this entire appeal by the appellant-or their authorized representative-have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1985 to December 2005.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sincerely thanks the Veteran for her many years honorable service to our country.

This case comes before the Board on appeal from an August 2020 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the August 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  The Veteran withdrew her request for a hearing on March 26, 2025.

Withdrawal/Dismissal Analysis

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by their authorized representative.  Id.

In the present case, the Veteran submitted a signed, written statement dated March 26, 2025 and received by VA on March 27, 2025 which stated "I request to withdraw my appeal and cancel my Board of Veterans['] Appeals hearing scheduled for 4 April 2025 at 9:30 a.m.  Docket Number 210813-179267."  See March 2025 VA Form 21-4138. 

This appeal-represented by Docket Number 210813-179267-was pending at the time of the Veteran's written correspondence.  Thus, on March 26, 2025 the Veteran withdrew this entire appeal.

Therefore, with all issues for this docket number being withdrawn, there remain no allegations of error of fact or law for appellate consideration with respect to this matter.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the Veteran's appeal regarding this claim and it is hereby DISMISSED.
