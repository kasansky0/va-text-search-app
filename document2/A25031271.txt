ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The persuasive evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran's right ankle disability was incurred in or caused by his service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1984 to June 1985 and from November 1986 to October 1994.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability

The Veteran is seeking service connection for his right ankle disability.

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed.Cir.2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).

In the May 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable finding that the Veteran has a currently diagnosed right ankle disability. Any favorable findings made by an AOJ, or any other prior VA adjudicator, is binding on the Board, absent evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.

Thus, the question before the Board is whether the currently diagnosed right ankle disability is related to service. The Board finds that it is not. 

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are negative for any right ankle complaints. The Board notes that the Veteran sought medical attention on numerous occasions for his left ankle and right knee.

Records submitted in March 2024 and April 2024, document that the Veteran was diagnosed with a right ankle disability. However, there are no statements pertaining to the etiology of the right ankle diagnoses.

A VA examination was not conducted as to the right ankle disability, but the Board finds the duty to assist does not require one in this case because there is no competent or credible evidence of an in-service event or indication that a current disability may be associated with service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006).

Furthermore, there is no incident in service which has been shown to have as likely as not caused the Veteran's right ankle disability. As the evidence of record is persuasively against the claim of entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability, the benefit of the doubt rule is not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Service connection for a right ankle disability is denied.
