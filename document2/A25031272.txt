ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of March 31, 2022, and no earlier, for service connection for asthma is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of March 31, 2022, and no earlier, for service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of March 31, 2022, and no earlier, for service connection for dry eye syndrome is granted.

Entitlement to an initial 20 percent rating, and no higher, for dry eye syndrome from March 31, 2022, and no earlier, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation, that was received on March 31, 2022.

2. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526, Fully Developed Claim (including a respiratory disability, GERD, and dry eye syndrome) on April 3, 2023. 

3. The Veteran included a message with his VA Form 21-526EZ asking that the VA accept his intent to file on March 31, 2022, as timely given the good cause exemptions allowed by the COVID-19 National Emergency. 

4. As each of the Veteran's claims may be granted on a direct basis and are not dependent on the PACT Act, service connection for asthma, GERD, and dry eye syndrome may be granted from March 31, 2022, pursuant to the good cause extensions allowed by the COVID-19 National Emergency. 

5. The Veteran's dry eye syndrome manifested functional impairment equivalent to bilateral disability of the lacrimal apparatus, and no higher, for the entire period.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1982 to February 1992.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a March 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), in May 2024.  He chose the direct review docket.  This means that the evidentiary review period closed at the time of the initial decision. The Board received and docketed the appeal in May 2024.

VA regulations require that the Board contact an appellant and request clarification if the Board cannot identify which review option an appellant intends to select. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f).  A NOD may be unclear if an appellant attaches evidence to a NOD indicating that the appellant is seeking Direct Review, as evidence submitted along with a NOD may not be considered by the Board under that review option. See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023).

In the instant appeal, the Veteran's representative submitted statements along with the NOD, to include argument that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) erred by not awarding effective dates of service connection from the effective date of the PACT Act on August 10, 2022. These contentions are posited as errors of application of the law and are properly before the Board. The present appeal is factually distinguishable from Edwards, and the Board can proceed with a decision without clarifying the Veteran's intent pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f).

Earlier Effective Date - Analysis

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for asthma, GERD, and dry eye syndrome.  He asserts that the effective date should be from the intent to file received on March 31, 2022.  Alternatively, he asserts the effective date for each disability should be August 10, 2022, pursuant to the PACT Act.

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award based on an original claim, a claim for increase, or a claim reopened after final disallowance shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred coincident with or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing direct service connection generally requires competent evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act added additional requirements to VA's duty to assist in providing exams and medical opinions for veterans who engaged in a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) during active duty service. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); PACT Act, Pub. L. No 117-168, § 404(c) (2022). This includes providing an examination to discuss the combined impact of all of a veteran's toxic exposures unless an exception to the rule applies. 38 U.S.C. § 1168.

The PACT Act also expanded presumptions that certain veterans were exposed to fine particulate matter during service and that certain diseases including asthma, rhinitis, and sinusitis, are presumptively linked to such exposure regardless of when such disability manifests after qualifying service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.320. This includes veterans who served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War.  38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(5).  Prior to the PACT Act, the law required that the qualifying condition manifest within ten years of discharge, but still presumed that Persian Gulf War veterans were exposed to particulate matter.  

Where pension, compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or a monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 for an individual who is a child of a Vietnam veteran or child of a veteran with covered service in Korea is awarded or increased pursuant to a liberalizing law, or a liberalizing VA issue approved by the Secretary or by the Secretary's direction, the effective date of such award or increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the act or administrative issue.  38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a).

If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of VA within 1 year from the effective date of the law or VA issue, or at the request of a claimant received within 1 year from that date, benefits may be authorized from the effective date of the law or VA issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(1).

After March 24, 2015, VA accepts intent to file a claim as a way of preserving the effective date of claims. A claimant, authorized representative, or some person acting as next friend of claimant who is not of full age or capacity may indicate a claimant's desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant. Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in paragraph (a) of § 3.160, appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

If VA receives a complete claim within 1 year of the filing of an intent to file a claim that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the intent to file a claim. Only one complete claim for a benefit (e.g., compensation, pension) may be associated with each intent to file a claim for that benefit, though multiple issues may be contained within a complete claim. In the event multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within 1 year of an intent to file a claim for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(ii).

On March 13, 2020, the President declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency, effective March 1, 2020.  In April 2020, VA issued guidance on the financial relief actions and time limit extensions it would be providing Veterans given this national emergency.  Although claimants were able to continue to file claims for compensations by mail, fax, or online, for those unable to file a claim due to the COVID-19 pandemic, VA was able to grant time limit extension requests and postpone final actions on a claim "provided good cause is shown for the delay. VA has determined that delays due to COVID-19 constitute good cause." See VBA Policy Letter 20-02 (Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)) Financial Relief Actions and Time Limit Extensions. The letter provided instructions for how a claimant should request such an extension, including that claimants should note the request on their filing submission or attach the request as a separate document.  

The COVID-19 National Emergency was legally ended on May 11, 2023.  See National Public Radio, Biden ends COVID national emergency after Congress acts, https://www.npr.org/2023/04/11/1169191865/biden-ends-covid-national-emergency (last accessed March 19, 2025).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  An approximate balance of the evidence includes but is not limited to equipoise.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Evidence is not in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  Id.

A brief discussion of the procedural history is necessary.  

The Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim that was received on March 22, 2022.  He did not submit a formal claim for VA benefits within a year of the intent to file. 

VA received a formal claim for service connection for 10 disabilities (including "chronic dyspnea, cough", GERD, dry eye syndrome) on April 3, 2023. Dyspnea is simply the medical term for trouble breathing.  See Dyspnea, Cleveland Clinic, https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/16942-dyspnea ("Dyspnea, or shortness of breath, is the feeling that you can't get enough air into your lungs").  He indicated that his disorders were related to exposure to sarin gas during service.  

He also submitted a statement in which he wrote, among other things, that:

"Per VA guidance dated April 2020 (attached), I am respectfully requesting that my intent to file date be honored under an exemption for timely filing because of COVID-19." 

There is a favorable VA medical opinion linking the Veteran's asthma to toxic exposures/airborne particulate matter in October 2023.  The examiner opined, among other things, that during deployment to Southwest Asia during Desert Storm, the Veteran was exposed to burn pits and smoke from oil fires and possible nerve gas exposure. He found that the Veteran developed a chronic dry cough and mild shortness of breath and that these symptoms have persisted since service. 

An October 2023 rating decision granted service connection for asthma (claimed as chronic dyspnea, cough) and assigned a 10 percent rating from September 2, 2023.  It assigned the effective date based on medical evidence showing the diagnosis of the condition.  However, it also found that service connection was granted based on the newly enacted presumptions under the PACT Act.  The AOJ deferred action on the Veteran's claims for GERD and dry eye syndrome until further development. 

A March 2024 rating decision granted service connection for GERD and dry eye syndrome.  It assigned a 10 percent rating for GERD and a non-compensable rating for dry eye syndrome both effective from April 3, 2023.  The AOJ also concluded that a clear and unmistakable error had occurred in the evaluation of asthma and "a decreased evaluation of 10 percent is established from August 10, 2023."  This actually represents a favorable grant of benefits because the evaluation for asthma remained at 10 percent and an earlier effective date was granted for compensation. 

The Veteran appealed this decision to the Board where it is now under review. His VA Form 10182 shows that he only challenged the rating for dry eye syndrome.  He limited his other appeals to an earlier effective date of service connection.

The Veteran filed an intent to file that was received on March 31, 2022.  He asked for VA to apply the good cause extensions of the COVID-19 National Emergency when he submitted his formal claim in April 2023.  It appears that he is eligible for such relief.  The Board sees no legal reason why the extension should not apply.  The Board will assign earlier effective dates of service connection for asthma, GERD, and dry eye syndrome from March 31, 2022.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b). 

The Board recognizes that the effective date of the PACT Act is August 10, 2022.  The AOJ claimed that service connection for asthma was granted based on the newly-established PACT Act presumption in appealed rating decision.  However, the Board finds that the Veteran was eligible for direct service connection for asthma. 

Here, the Veteran was diagnosed with asthma, was already presumed to have been exposed to airborne pollutants/particulate matter per the version of 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 in effect prior to the PACT Act, and a VA examiner provided a favorable nexus opinion in October 2023 linking asthma to exposure to airborne particulate matter.  As such, it appears that the Veteran's claim of service connection for asthma is not limited by the effective date of the PACT Act from August 10, 2022.  

The Board will resolve reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and grant earlier effective dates of service connection for asthma, GERD, and dry eye syndrome from March 31, 2022.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. This is consistent with the intent to file received on March 3, 2022, and the good cause extensions to the one-year deadline allowed by the COVID-19 National Emergency.  The Board does not see any basis for an earlier effective date prior to March 31, 2022, in the claims file.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative has asserted otherwise in cognizable form.  The appeal is granted to the aforementioned extent.

Increased Rating - Dry Eye Syndrome

The Veteran seeks an increased rating for dry eyes.  His representative asserted that VA erred by not assigning a 20 percent rating for bilateral dry eye syndrome. 

Dry eye disease affects the layers of tears that cover your cornea. It happens when you don't have enough tears or when your tears evaporate too quickly. Symptoms include burning, itching and a gritty feeling in your eye.  See Dry Eye, Cleveland Clinic, https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24479-dry-eye (last accessed March 18, 2025).

The tear system (lacrimal apparatus) is a network of glands, sacs and ducts around your eyes. It makes new tears and drains old ones out of your eyes. Dry or watery eyes are the most common symptom of something interfering with your tear system. Some of the most common conditions that affect your tear system include dry eyes, watery eyes, and blocked tear ducts.  See Tear System (Lacrimal Apparatus), Cleveland Clinic, https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24415-lacrimal-apparatus (last accessed March 18, 2025).

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a service-connected disability adversely affects ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods in which the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different evaluations, the assignment of staged ratings is appropriate. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

The Veteran's dry eye syndrome is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, DC 6099-6025.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires the use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  The disability is actively rated under DC 6025.

DC 6025 assigns ratings for disorders of the lacrimal apparatus (epiphora, dacryocystitis, etc.).  A 20 percent rating is warranted when such disorders are bilateral.  A 10 percent rating is warranted when such disorders are unilateral. 

The VA examination in January 2024 documented that the Veteran has bilateral dry eye syndrome.  The examiner checked the box for "yes" indicating that the Veteran has dry eye syndrome and specified that it was in both eyes.  Perplexingly, the examiner also checked the box for "no" when asked whether the Veteran has a disorder of the lacrimal apparatus (including dry eyes).  

The Veteran's representative made the following statement:

"The rating was assigned as an analogous rating under diagnostic code 6025. The criteria for a 20% rating under that diagnostic code is simply "bilateral". The rater stated that the 20% is not warranted unless there is the actual diagnosis listed in the regulation. This logic would mean that no analogous ratings could get compensable ratings because they don't have the diagnosis for the diagnostic code it is being assigned to. The Veteran clearly meets the criteria for 20% based on it being bilateral as an analogous rating."

The Board agrees.  The Veteran has bilateral dry eye syndrome.  The rating criteria allow a 20 percent rating for bilateral eye disorder affecting the lacrimal apparatus.  Dry eye is considered a disorder of the lacrimal apparatus.  An initial 20 percent rating is warranted from March 31, 2022.  The appeal is granted to that extent.

A higher rating was considered.  However, a 20 percent rating is the maximum that may be assigned for bilateral eye disorders of the lacrimal apparatus.  The evidence does not show that the Veteran's dry eyes causes visual impairment.  Neither the Veteran nor the evidence of record has suggested the existence of exceptional or unusual impairment to warrant referral for consideration of an extraschedular rating.  38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b).  A higher rating than 20 percent is not warranted.

In summary, an initial 20 percent rating, and no higher, is warranted for dry eye syndrome from March 31, 2022.  The appeal is granted to this extent.
