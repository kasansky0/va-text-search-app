REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2023 decision.  In July 2023 the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2023 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 decision [and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window].  

In July 2024 VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), as completed by the Veteran's attorney. The July 2024 VA Form 10182 did not reflect election of a Board review option, and also indicated that the Veteran sought to appeal a denial of benefits by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which was inconsistent with the identification of the issue on appeal as arising from a July 2023 decision by a Regional Office of the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). 

The Veteran and his attorney were advised by correspondence dated August 8, 2024, that the Board could not proceed with review of his appeal until and unless he timely submitted a properly completed VA Form 10182. In August 2024 VA received a properly completed VA Form 10182 reflecting the Veteran's election of the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. This evidence includes evidence submitted in conjunction with his August 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran and his attorney were advised by correspondence Dated September 4, 2024, that because he selected the Direct Review option, any additional evidence submitted on or with his VA Form 10182 could not be legally considered. The Veteran and his attorney were advised of his option to change his Board appeal request and switch to either the Evidence Submission or Hearing dockets. The record does not reflect any request by the Veteran to switch dockets. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

An August 2024 brief filed by the Veteran, through counsel, reflect his request that the Board grant service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The Board finds that clarification of the matter on appeal would be of assistance to the Veteran and his attorney. 

In October 2021 VA received a claim of service connection for PTSD. In January 2022 the AOJ granted service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability characterized as unspecified trauma and stressor-related disorder and assigned an initial rating of 30 percent. In January 2023 VA received a Supplemental Claim from the Veteran in which he challenged the "accuracy of mental health diagnosis." In the February 2023 Supplemental Claim decision on appeal the AOJ adjudicated the issue of entitlement to an initial rating in excess 30 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress. The AOJ did not adjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD. Therefore, the Board cannot adjudicate this issue.  The appellant may resubmit the review request to the AOJ or notify the AOJ that the issue is still pending. The only issue presently on appeal before the Board is entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress (depressive disorder). 

1. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress is remanded.

The Board may remand for correction of error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. The Board finds that remand of the Veteran's rating claim is required to correct a failure to satisfy a statutory duty. 

In adjudicating a claim for benefits, VA must consider all pertinent lay and medical evidence of record. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1154(a), § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Prior to the February 2023 AOJ decision, which was later subject to HLR, the Veteran submitted non-VA medical evidence, to include treatment records and an evaluation performed for the purpose of supporting his claim for disability benefits. Neither the February 2023 rating decision nor the July 2023 HLR decision on appeal reflect that this evidence was considered. Accordingly, the Board cannot find that the AOJ has satisfied VA's duty to consider all pertinent lay and medical evidence of record and remand is required.
