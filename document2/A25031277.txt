ORDER

Entitlement to an annual clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for topical medications used to treat the Veteran's service-connected skin disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The topical medications prescribed for the Veteran's service-connected skin disability are shown to have caused irreparable damage to his outer garments during 2020.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for topical medications used to treat a service-connected skin disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1162 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 3.810 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1986 to May 1993 and from August 1998 to October 2010.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a purported October 2020 determination issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Prosthetics Department.

In his November 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to an annual clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for topical medications used to treat the Veteran's service-connected skin disability 

The law provides for payment of an annual clothing allowance for each veteran who, because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance which VA determines tends to wear out or tear the clothing of the veteran or uses medication which a physician has prescribed for a skin condition which is due to a service-connected disability and VA determines causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer garments. 38 U.S.C. § 1162.

The implementing regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.810, provides, in pertinent part, that an annual clothing allowance may be granted when the Under Secretary for Health or a designee certifies that a veteran, because of a service-connected disability or disabilities, wears or uses one qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair) which tends to wear or tear clothing, or that a veteran uses medication prescribed by a physician for one skin condition, which is due to a service-connected disability, that causes irreparable damage to the Veteran's outer garments. 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1)(ii).

The Veteran's clothing allowance claim for the calendar year 2020 was denied on the basis that his prescribed skin medication did not cause irreparable staining. The Veteran is service connected for eczema.  Excerpts from his VA treatment records show that he has been prescribed triamcinolone and hydrocortisone to treat his service-connected skin disability.   

The clothing allowance section of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Handbook indicates that the VA Prosthetics and Pharmacy workgroup has created a list of skin medications, ointments, or lotions that it found may cause irreparable staining, discoloration, bleeding, and damage to clothing, which is not removable by laundering or dry cleaning and lists skin medications that it found may not cause such damage. The medication reported by the Veteran are categorized by VHA as medications determined not to stain or damage clothing.

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, however, the Board finds that a clothing allowance for calendar year 2020 is warranted for the topical medications. The Board notes the AOJ determined the topical medications were not considered the type to stain or damage the Veteran's clothing. However, the Veteran is competent to report that these medications cause staining and wear and tear to his outer garments, as wear and tear to his own clothing is an observable phenomenon.  The simple fact that he appealed this denial indicates the Veteran's position that his clothing is stained by the prescribed medications.

Given the above, and resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that a clothing allowance is warranted for the 2020 calendar year for the Veteran's topical medications used to treat his service-connected skin disability. Accordingly, a clothing allowance for calendar year 2020 is granted.
