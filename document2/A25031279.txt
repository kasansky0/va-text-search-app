ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that bladder cancer began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bladder cancer are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty with the United States Air Force from March 2003 to November 2003, July 2006 to February 2007, November 2007, to September 2011, and October 2012 to May 2013.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See, e.g., Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

An adequate medical opinion with regard to etiology should consist of a thorough review of the claims file and discussion of the relevant evidence (including the disability in question), a consideration of the lay contentions of the Veteran, and clear conclusions with a reasoned supporting rationale.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999).  When the evidence is at least evenly balanced between positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant; however, if the evidence is persuasively for or against a claim, then the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the issue is adjudicated in accordance with the evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

The July 2023 rating decision made the favorable findings: participation in toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) is conceded; the Veteran is diagnosed with a disability; the June 2023 VA medical exam confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of bladder cancer.

Factual Background

The February 2023 private treatment record notes the Veteran quit smoking 26 years prior.  The Veteran's past smoking included cigarettes.

In the April 2023 VA 21-526 EZ fully developed claim the Veteran claimed entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer as a result of burn pits during periods of deployment.

The June 2023 VA memo confirmed the Veteran participated in a TERA.  The Veteran's record confirms service in a Southwest Asia theater of operations location.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e)(2).

The July 2023 VA medical exam (urinary conditions) reviewed the Veteran's records and conducted an in-person examination.  The examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of bladder cancer, with an onset in February 2023, and surgical removal of the bladder in March 2023.  The examiner opined the Veteran's bladder cancer was less likely than not caused by the TERA after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran, and the synergistic combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran.  The examiner opined the risk factors in developing bladder cancer include: smoking cigarettes, which cause harmful chemicals to accumulate in the urine, in turn damaging the lining of the bladder; advancing age, with most diagnosed with bladder cancer being over 55; being male; exposure to chemicals including arsenic and those used in the production of dyes, rubber, leather, textiles, and paint; previous treatment for cancer; family history of bladder cancer.  The examiner opined that while exposure to certain chemicals is a risk factor in bladder cancer, the Veteran's record did not show he had exposure to those particular chemicals.  Therefore, the Veteran's bladder cancer was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments, and the synergistic combined effect of all TERA activities of the Veteran.

Analysis

The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer due to exposure to burn pits (TERA).  The July 2023 rating decision made the favorable findings; TERA is conceded, the Veteran is diagnosed with the disability of bladder cancer.  Therefore, the matter remaining before the Board is whether there is a nexus (causal relationship) between the Veteran's bladder cancer and his TERA exposure while in active-duty service.  

The Board notes that bladder cancer is presumptively service connected in some TERA, including radiation exposed Veterans, and Veterans exposed to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (d) and (f).  The Board finds there is no evidence of record the Veteran's TERA falls within the requirements of a Veteran exposed to radiation or contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a) (7), 3.309 (d) (3). 

The Board notes certain chronic disabilities and infectious diseases occurring in Persian Gulf Veterans are presumptively service connected.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317, 3.320.  However, bladder cancer is not one of the diseases that qualify for presumptive service connection due to service in the Persian Gulf, or exposure to fine particulate matter.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317, 3.320. 

The Board acknowledges that the absence of a disease from the presumptive list does not preclude the Veteran from otherwise proving that his disability resulted from exposure in a TERA on the basis of "facts found."  Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

The Board finds the July 2023 VA medical exam competent and credible.  The July 2023 VA medical exam was completed by an appropriately qualified medical professional following review of the Veteran's records, and an in-person examination of the Veteran.  The Board finds the July 2023 VA medical exam is generally consistent with the evidence of record.  The Board finds the July 2023 VA medical exam provided adequate reasons for the conclusion reached.  The Board affords the July 2023 VA medical exam probative weight.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran is competent to report his readily observable symptoms and the circumstances of his active-duty service.  However, the etiology of the Veteran's bladder cancer is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical knowledge.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Board finds there is no evidence of record the Veteran is appropriately qualified to opine on the etiology of his bladder cancer.  

The Board finds the persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding the Veteran's bladder cancer is as likely as not related to his TERA, including exposure to burn bits, during active-duty service.  

The Board finds the July 2023 VA medical exam noted the Veteran's record did not contain evidence of exposure to the particular chemicals with known risks of developing bladder cancer.  The July 2023 VA medical exam found the Veteran's conceded TERA are not well known or established to cause or increase risk of developing bladder cancer.  The July 2023 VA medical exam noted the risks of developing bladder cancer include being a male over 55, with a history of cigarette smoking.  The Board finds the February 2023 private treatment record confirms the Veteran is a former cigarette smoker.  The July 2023 VA medical exam found the Veteran's personal risk factors were more likely to have caused his bladder cancer.  Said another way, the Veteran's bladder cancer is less likely than not a result of his TERA.  

The Board finds the July 2023 VA medical exam determined it is more likely than not the Veteran's bladder cancer was caused by non-service-related personal risk factors including age, sex, and a history of cigarette smoking.  The Board emphasizes the etiology of the Veteran's bladder cancer is medically complex requiring an appropriately qualified medical professional opinion.  As stated above the July 2023 VA medical exam provides a full rationale for the conclusions reached.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).  The Board further emphasizes the applicable standard is not whether the Veteran's TERA presents a theoretical risk of developing bladder cancer, but rather whether the Veteran's TERA is more likely than other personal risk factors to be the cause of the Veteran's bladder cancer.     

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim.  As a result, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the Veteran's claim is adjudicated in accordance with the evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  The Veteran's claim for service connection of bladder cancer is not warranted by the persuasive weight of the evidence and the Veteran's appeal must hereby be DENIED.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.
