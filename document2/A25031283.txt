ORDER

The claim for an initial 10 percent rating, but not higher, for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's IBS manifests symptoms of diarrhea that most nearly approximate moderate severity, with frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial 10 percent rating, but not higher, for IBS are met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.16, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7319 (2023).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from July 2001 to July 2005. This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400 (a)(1). Here, the September 2023 rating decision issued by the VA, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), was generated in response to the Veteran's April 2023 claim for service connection. The September 2023 rating decision constitutes an initial decision, and the AMA applies.

Service connection for IBS was granted in the September 2023 rating decision on appeal with an initial noncompensable (0 percent) evaluation assigned effective August 10, 2022. In response, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal on August 22, 2024. He elected to place his appeal on the Direct Review docket. As a valid and timely VA Form 10182 was received, the appeal is properly before the Board.

The Veteran elected to place this appeal on the Direct Review docket on the August 2024 VA Form 10182. Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. In other words, the Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the AOJ issued the September 2023 rating decision.

The Veteran's August 2024 VA Form 10182 includes an attached statement from the Veteran's representative. Typically, this would necessitate clarification of the Veteran's document selection, as the Direct Review docket does not allow the Board to consider any evidence added to the record after the issuance of the September 2023 decision. See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023). However, the representative's August 2024 statement constitutes argument (as opposed to evidence), and a docket clarification is not necessary. The representative's argument has been considered by the Board in the decision below. 

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for IBS.

Service connection for IBS was granted in the September 2023 rating decision on appeal with an initial noncompensable (0 percent) evaluation assigned effective August 10, 2022. The Veteran contends that a higher rating is warranted as he experiences frequent episodes of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and gas that limit his ability to travel outside his home. 

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. Where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods in which the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different evaluations at any point during the appeal, the assignment of staged ratings is appropriate. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

For disabilities evaluated based on limitation of motion, VA is required to apply the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, pertaining to functional impairment. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); Johnston v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 80, 84-5 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 4.59; see also Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021) (ankylosis may be met by evidence demonstrating the functional equivalent of ankylosis).

The Veteran's IBS is rated as noncompensably disabling by analogy under Diagnostic Code 7913 pertaining to irritable colon syndrome (spastic colitis, mucous colitis, etc.).  The Board notes that the criteria for rating disabilities of the digestive system were amended effective May 19, 2024. See Schedule for Rating Disabilities; The Digestive System, 89 Fed. Reg. 19,735 (March 20, 2024). These changes created the new Diagnostic Code 7319 specifically pertaining to IBS. However, as the rating period under review in this case ends in September 2023, the change in criteria effective from May 2024 does not apply. The Board will therefore apply the older version of 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 and continue to rate the Veteran's IBS by analogy to irritable colon syndrome. 

Under Diagnostic Code 7319, a noncompensable rating is warranted for mild irritable symptoms with disturbances of bowel function with occasional episodes of abdominal distress. A 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate symptoms with frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress. A maximum rating of 30 percent is warranted for severe diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea and constipation, with more or less constant abdominal distress. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7319. 

The Board notes that words such as "severe," "moderate," and "mild" are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all evidence, to the end that decisions will be just. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, it is not dispositive of an issue. Rather, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision for an initial disability rating. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

The adjective "mild" is defined as "not being or involving what is extreme," and "not severe: temperate." Mild, Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mild, Definitions 2 and 3 (last visited April 1, 2025). The adjective "moderate" is defined as "not violent, severe, or intense;" and "limited in scope or effect." Moderate, Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moderate, Definitions 3 and 5 (last visited April 1, 2025). "Severe," as an adjective, is defined as "causing discomfort or hardship;" "very painful or harmful;" "of a great degree." Severe, Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/severe, Definitions 6a, 6b, and 8 (last visited April 1, 2025). It is noted that the Veteran has not provided any definitions of those terms for the Board's consideration.

The Board finds that an initial 10 percent evaluation is warranted for the Veteran's IBS based on the reports of a moderate disability that manifests frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress. The medical evidence during the relevant rating period supports the award of an initial 10 percent evaluation. Upon VA examination in August 2023, the Veteran reported experiencing symptoms of chronic diarrhea after eating certain foods. The examiner specifically found that the Veteran had frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress, criteria contemplated by a 10 percent evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7319. The Board also finds that an April 2023 statement from the Veteran supports the claim for a higher 10 percent evaluation. The Veteran reported having bouts of diarrhea several times a week, along with abdominal pain, gas, cramping, and bloating. His condition impacts his ability to travel comfortably outside his home and causes embarrassment at work. These reports are consistent with a higher rating, as well as the competent medical evidence, and the evidence therefore supports the award of an initial 10 percent evaluation for IBS under Diagnostic Code 7319.

The Board has also considered whether a higher initial rating is warranted but finds that the Veteran's IBS does not most nearly approximate the criteria contemplated by a maximum 30 percent evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7319. While the medical and lay evidence establishes the presence of frequent diarrhea, there is no evidence of alternating diarrhea and constipation as part of the Veteran's IBS as specifically provided for in the rating criteria. 

Additionally, the evidence does not establish the presence of more or less constant abdominal distress due to IBS. In his April 2023 statement, the Veteran reported that he experienced diarrhea several times a week occurring "every few days." The Veteran also described needing to go to the bathroom seven to eight times a day during an IBS exacerbation, and experiencing incontinence requiring the wearing of absorbent materials. However, the Board finds this characterization of the severity of his IBS, incontinence, and other symptoms, is not consistent with the other evidence of record. Notably, VA treatment records dated during the relevant rating period are entirely absent for complaints or treatment related to the Veteran's IBS. He was seen at the VAMC in May 2018 and November 2019 for complaints of acute diarrhea requiring him to miss work and visit the bathroom eight times, but the Board observes these incidences occurred years before the effective date of the Veteran's award of service connection for IBS (on August 10, 2022). To the extent the Veteran's description of his symptoms in the April 2023 statement may pertain to the severity of his disability in 2018 and 2019, the Board finds his statements are not relevant to the current rating period. 

Furthermore, VAMC records dated during the relevant rating period document the Veteran's consistent denial of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and gas. The Veteran also never reported experiencing incontinence or requiring absorbent materials while receiving medical treatment. Finally, the Veteran's only reported symptoms of IBS at the August 2023 VA examination was diarrhea after eating certain foods; he did not report experiencing any pain, or incontinence, and certainly not to the severity argued in the April 2023 statement. The Board also acknowledges the Veteran's reports that he sometimes misses work due to exacerbations of IBS, but observes the August 2023 VA examiner found that the service-connected IBS did not impact the Veteran's occupational functioning. 

The Veteran is competent to report the symptoms he experiences, but the Board finds that the characterization of his symptoms provided in the context of receiving contemporaneous medical treatment, such as with his VAMC providers, is more credible than that provided during a claim for disability compensation. As such, the Board reiterates that the Veteran consistently denied experiencing any GI symptoms on multiple occasions at the VAMC and was never seen for any IBS-related manifestations. Thus, while the Veteran's April 2023 statement regarding the frequent, but not constant nature of his IBS is consistent with an increased 10 percent evaluation, the Board finds that it does not support a maximum 30 percent evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7319.

Thus, the Board finds the evidence is consistent with the current 10 percent evaluation and a disability that is "limited in scope and effect" and moderate in degree. The evidence establishes the presence of frequent bouts of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms, but not more or less constant, and only occurring several times a week. The competent medical evidence, based on medical expertise, also shows there is no impact on actual occupational functioning, though the Board acknowledges the embarrassment associated with the Veteran's IBS and has considered this impact in the assignment of an initial 10 percent evaluation. Additionally, the frequent, but not constant, nature of the Veteran's symptoms is contemplated by the current initial 10 percent evaluation and is not consistent with a severe or "very harmful" disability as the Veteran indicates that some days he experiences no symptoms of IBS. 

The medical and lay evidence therefore establishes that the Veteran's IBS most nearly approximates an initial 10 percent evaluation, but not higher, under Diagnostic Code 7319. The Board has considered the Veteran's reports that his symptoms are more severe than reflected by the rating above, but the Board finds the credibility of these statements is reduced as they are not consistent with the competent medical evidence, which is based on objective testing and medical expertise. The Board has also considered whether there is any other schedular basis for granting a higher rating, but has found none. In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran's representative specifically contends in the August 2024 statement that Diagnostic Code 7319 applies to the current claim. In addition, the Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt but has determined that it is not applicable because the evidence significantly and substantially weighs against the claim for a rating higher than that granted above. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
