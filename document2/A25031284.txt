ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for left ventricular hypertrophy is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's left ventricular hypertrophy is characterized by cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram, but not by workload of 3.1-5.0 metabolic equivalents (METs) resulting in heart failure symptoms, or worse.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for left ventricular hypertrophy have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.100, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7007.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1991 to May 1998.

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2022 decision.  In September 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2022 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.

Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, consideration of the medical evidence since the effective date of the award of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of a "staged" rating is required. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999). VA adjudicators must consider whether to assign different ratings at different times during the rating period to compensate the Veteran for times when the disability may have been more severe than at others. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has since extended this practice even to established ratings, not just initial ratings. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for left ventricular hypertrophy.

The Veteran seeks a compensable disability rating for left ventricular hypertrophy, rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7007, which is rated in accordance with the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart. Rating of hypertensive heart disease is based in part on the level of METs at which dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops. For purposes of the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart, heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (3). 

A 10 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 7.1-10.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or continuous medication is required for control. A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 5.1-7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or where there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multi-gated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging). A 60 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.1-5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms. A 100 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms. 

Review of the record shows that service connection is also in effect, with a separate noncompensable rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. Note (3) to Diagnostic Code 7101 states that hypertension should be evaluated separately from hypertensive heart disease and other types of heart disease. 

The February 2022 VA Heart Conditions examination report noted an August 2019 diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy, and diagnosed no other heart conditions. The Veteran reported no symptoms from the disorder, but noted he was prescribed two medications which treated both the hypertension and the ventricular hypertrophy. In interview-based METs testing, the Veteran denied the presence of any symptoms attributable to a cardiac condition with any level of physical activity. The examiner reported no functional impairment caused by the heart condition; a normal functional status was confirmed by a June 2021 normal chest X-ray and by an August 2019 echocardiogram, which showed both cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dilation. The Board's review of the Veteran's claims file revealed the August 2019 echocardiogram report, which confirmed these findings. 

As noted above, a 30 percent rating may be assigned where there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent, even in the absence of dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope at the METs level in question. Thus, a 30 percent rating is warranted. However, the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of a rating greater than 30 percent. Neither the February 2022 VA Heart Conditions examination nor the Veteran's outpatient treatment records dated during the period on appeal show heart failure symptoms were present at any time during the appeal period. As noted above, the Veteran confirmed at the February 2022 VA Heart Conditions examination that he had no heart-related difficulties with any level of physical activity.

Accordingly, a 30 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's left ventricular hypertrophy. To this extent only, the appeal is granted. The Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt but has determined that it is inapplicable, because the evidence of record persuasively weighs against higher ratings beyond that awarded by this decision. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
