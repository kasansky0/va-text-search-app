REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 1974 to March 1982.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the June 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. This development was completed, and the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a decision in July 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300,?20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for bilateral hearing loss, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his bilateral hearing loss is proximately due to noise exposure while in service. The Veteran's Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) was an Aerospace Ground Equipment Technician, which the AOJ has conceded has a high probability of hazardous noise exposure. The Veteran has also submitted several medical articles related to delayed onset hearing loss. The Veteran submitted a statement in May 2023 indicating he noticed hearing loss a few years after discharge from service when he started working as an auto-mechanic.

The Veteran has undergone three VA examinations related to his bilateral hearing loss, with each providing an opinion that the Veteran's hearing loss was less likely than not related to service. The VA examinations occurred in December 2022, May 2023 and a toxic exposure examination in November 2023. The December 2022 and May 2023 VA examiners based their opinion on the fact that the Veteran did not have a shift in audiometric testing while in service, despite the fact the Veteran received four separate audiological evaluations due to his MOS hazardous noise exposure. The November 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran's hearing loss was not due to toxic exposure while in service, but did not address whether the Veteran's hearing loss was directly related to noise exposure while in service. No VA examiner specifically addressed the Veteran's statement that he experienced hearing loss shortly after service.

It is well-established that service connection for a hearing loss disability can still be warranted even when the Veteran had normal audiometric tests upon discharge from service. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993). The failure of the VA examiners to address the Veteran's competent lay statements regarding the inset of his hearing loss render the examinations inadequate for adjudication purposes. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (stating that "The Board must be able to conclude that a medical expert has applied valid medical analysis to the significant facts of the particular case in order to reach the conclusion submitted in the medical opinion."). 

The failure of the AOJ to secure a VA examination which addresses the significant facts of the Veteran's case constitutes a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error requiring a remand to correct. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (holding that once VA provides an examination to the Veteran, it must be an adequate one).

Accordingly, on remand, the AOJ must secure an addendum opinion where the examiner addresses the Veteran's lay statements regarding the chronology of his hearing loss and which does not base the conclusion on the absence of audiological shift evidence while in service.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's hearing loss is at least as likely as not related noise exposure while in service. The examiner must explicitly address the Veteran's May 2023 statement indicating the onset and course of his bilateral hearing loss. Additionally, the VA examiner must explicitly address the hearing loss articles the Veteran submitted in May 2023 and October 2023.

Finally, the VA examiner cannot rely on the absence of hearing loss documented while in service to support a negative conclusion. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993).
