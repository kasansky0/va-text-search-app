REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1966 to February 1970.  

This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which denied entitlement to service connection for COPD.  

In a December 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (notice of disagreement (NOD)) (VA Form 10182), the Veteran timely appealed the September 2024 rating decision and elected the Evidence Submission docket.  As the Veteran has requested the Evidence Submission Docket, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on the issue or issues on appeal and evidence submitted with the NOD and within 90 days following receipt of the NOD.  The Board will not consider evidence added to the record in between the date of the AOJ decision on appeal and the date of the NOD or after 90 days following the date of the NOD.  If evidence was added during this ineligible period, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, she may at any time, file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

The Board notes that the issue of entitlement to service connection for COPD was addressed in a separate appeal stream under a different docket number (240928-477179).  Given that the in the modernized review system it is possible to have the same issue adjudicated in separate appeal streams, the Board will address the issue consistent with the remand under the other docket number.  Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394, 401 (2024) ("because TDIU can come up basically any time VA is rating a disability, VA may need to address it as part of separate claim streams when it is rating different disabilities").

Finally, although one year has not elapsed since the September 2024 rating decision on appeal, and because 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) "gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up," Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024), given that the Veteran submitted additional evidence within 90 days of the NOD, he cannot modify his NOD.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c) ("Requests to modify a Notice of Disagreement will not be granted if the appellant has submitted evidence or testimony as described in §§ 20.302 and 20.303").

Service Connection

A June 2016 VA treatment note indicates he is diagnosed with COPD.  Thus, a current disability has been demonstrated.

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) was signed into law on August 10, 2022.  The PACT Act included changes to medical examination requirements where there is documented toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).  Under the PACT Act, Section 303 implemented 38 U.S.C. § 1168, requiring VA to schedule an examination and request a medical opinion for certain non-presumptive diseases involving TERA.  For such claims, absent a specific exception that does not apply here, VA is required to provide a disability examination and medical opinion when a veteran submits a claim for compensation, has evidence of a disability, has evidence of participation in a TERA, and such evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability.  Under 38 U.S.C. § 1710(e)(4), a TERA is defined as any activity that required a corresponding entry in an exposure tracking record system, to include any system used by the Secretary of Defense to track how veterans or members of the Armed Forces have been exposed to various occupational or environmental hazards.  See also 38 U.S.C. § 1119(c)(2).

In a July 2024 VA Memorandum, the AOJ determined he participated in TERA.  Therefore, the in-service injury or disease requirement is met.  

The remaining question is whether a nexus exists between the Veteran's current COPD and his military service.  

The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination or medical opinion for his claim of service connection for COPD.  VA is obliged to provide an examination or obtain a medical opinion in a claim when the record contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a current disability, the record indicates that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of disability may be associated with active service, and the record does not contain sufficient information to make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

The threshold for triggering VA's duty to assist by affording the Veteran a VA examination or opinion is low.  Locklear v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 410 (2006); McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83.  The Veteran's reports of a continuity of symptomatology can satisfy the requirement for evidence that the claimed disability may be associated with service.  McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83.  

The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination for his COPD.  In its remand under the other docket number, the Board found that the Veteran had good cause for not reporting to a scheduled examination as to the etiology of his COPD and the Board adheres to this finding under this docket number.  Given the Veteran's current diagnosis of COPD and in-service TERA, a remand is necessary for a VA examination or opinion to determine the etiology of this disability and to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d), (f)(2)(A); 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's COPD.  If an examination is deemed necessary, one should be conducted, to include via telehealth if necessary.  

The clinician must opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that his COPD (1) began during active service; or (2) is related to an in-service injury or disease, including participation in toxic exposure risk activity or activities.  Specifically, the clinician must acknowledge the Veteran's exposure to TERAs.

In forming these opinions, the clinician must consider and specifically discuss (i) the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments; and (ii) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities.

The clinician is advised that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms and treatment and that his reports must be taken into account in formulating the requested opinion.
