REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer, to include as due to ionizing radiation, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1976 to April 1983 and from February 1986 to June 2004.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2023 issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In his June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

1. Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is remanded.

The evidence of record reflects that the Veteran submitted a claim in March 2023, seeking entitlement to service connection for a number of disorders, including prostate cancer.  In support of this claim he submitted letter from a physician's assistant at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego, California, who stated that it the Veteran's prostate cancer was at least as likely as not related to his military service, and in particular to his exposure to ionizing radiation as an X-ray technician.

While developing this claim, the RO considered whether the Veteran's disorder was related to participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), as is required by the PACT Act, See PL 117-168 (August 10, 2022), and obtained an VA opinion to consider this question.  In September 2023, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's prostate cancer was less likely than not related to the Veteran's toxic exposure, including his ionizing radiation exposure. The RO denied the claim on the basis of this opinion.

While both opinions have addressed the nature of the Veteran's duties, and did consider the effects of the Veteran's participation in a TERA, nothing in the PACT Act supersedes the development required for radiogenic diseases under 38 C.F.R. § 3.311.  Here, it is indisputable that prostate cancer is a radiogenic disease under that section.  Moreover, it is also clear that the Veteran was exposed to ionizing radiation based on his DD-1141 record of exposure, which is in the claims file.   

Therefore, in order to address the specific question of whether the Veteran's prostate cancer is related to his ionizing radiation exposure, VA must consider whether entitlement is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 3.311, to include obtaining an advisory opinion that considers the Veteran's lifetime ionizing radiation dose, and whether such exposure may be responsible for his prostate cancer.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Follow the procedures of 38 C.F.R. § 3.311, to refer the claim for entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer, due to exposure to ionizing radiation to the VA Under Secretary for Benefits for further consideration in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.311(c), who may request an advisory medical opinion from the VA Under Secretary of Health under 38 C.F.R. § 3.311(b), (c)(1). If needed, include pertinent evidence of the Veteran's exposure to ionizing radiation and dose estimates, to include Radiation Exposure History. 

2. The RO should conduct any additional development deemed necessary, to include obtaining any additional examinations or opinions.
