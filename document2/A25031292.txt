REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from May 2004 to June 2010.

This matter comes to the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) on appeal from an August 2020 supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) issued by a VA Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the?Direct?Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the?evidence?of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.? 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

In a February 2024 Decision, the Board denied entitlement to an evaluation higher than 10 percent for GERD throughout the appeal period.  The Veteran appealed the denial to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC).  The Veteran and the Office of the General Counsel for VA (collectively referred to as "the Parties") resolved that appeal by way of a January 2025 Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR).  The Parties agreed that the Board needed to readjudicate the issue and it was vacated and remanded to the Board.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

As noted above, in January 2025, CAVC granted a JMPR and remanded the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an increased evaluation for GERD.

The JMPR noted that the Board erred when it failed to ensure substantial compliance with the Board's October 2019 remand order prior to adjudicating the above issue.  See 38 U.S.C § 5103A; Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998) (holding that the Board errs as a matter of law when it fails to ensure compliance with remand orders); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (holding that once the Secretary undertakes the effort to provide an examination, he must provide an adequate one).  Failure to comply with Board remand directives constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159 (c), 20.802(a). 

The Court noted that the October 2019 remand instructed the agency of original jurisdiction to obtain a new VA examination to determine the current severity of the Veteran's GERD.  The examiner was instructed to specifically consider whether the Veteran's medication had any ameliorating effects on his symptoms and, if so, indicate or estimate the severity of his condition without the medication.  The January 2020 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran was taking medication to treat his GERD but did not address the ameliorating effects of this medication.  As such, remand is required in order to obtain an adequate VA opinion that complies with prior Board remand directives.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a retrospective opinion regarding the severity of the Veteran's GERD at the time of the January 2020 VA examination.  To the extent possible, the examiner should specifically consider whether the Veteran's medication has any ameliorating effects on his symptoms and, if so, indicate or estimate what the severity of his condition would be without these effects.  The claims file should be reviewed by the examiner.  All symptomatology associated with the Veteran's GERD should be reported.  A complete rationale should be provided for all opinions and conclusions expressed.
