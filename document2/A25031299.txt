REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right hand condition is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a left hand condition is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1983 to March 1994, with additional service in the Army National Guard.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2020 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the January 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2020 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right hand condition

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left hand condition

The Board must remand an appeal to the AOJ for correction of an error on the part of the AOJ to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A if the error occurred prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. These claims must be remanded for correction of the following pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for a bilateral hand condition in January 2020. His theory of entitlement was that he had a bilateral hand disability "due to work in [the] chow hall" during service. See January 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ. The AOJ did not request a VA examination in connection with the claims.

VA must provide a medical exam when there is: (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies; (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). 

The AOJ has favorably found that service treatment records (STR) show treatment for the left hand in 1986 and 1990. See March 2020 Rating Decision-Narrative. The Board is bound by this finding and finds no clear and unmistakable error to rebut it. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The Veteran's military personnel records reflect that during his active service he was a food service specialist (see VA Form DD-214; see also June 2017 DPRIS Response- Evaluation Report), and his STRs document at least one symptom possibly attributable to a right hand condition. In that regard, shortly after his separation from active duty and enlistment to the National Guard, his Report of Medical Examination documents a "scar rt thumb;" and the Report of Medical History denotes the Veteran's report of "stitches, hands." See April 18, 1995 Report of Medical Examination; see also April 18, 1995 Report of Medical History. 

The Board finds that the foregoing pre-decisional evidence met the low threshold of the McLendon standard. As a VA examination was not obtained, this pre-decisional duty to assist error must be corrected on remand.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of any right and left hand conditions. After reviewing the claims file, performing a physical examination of the Veteran, and conducting any indicated tests, the examiner is asked to address the following:

(a) Please identify all current left and right hand disabilities by diagnosis or functional impairment of earning capacity.

(b) For each left and right hand disability identified, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the disability was incurred in or caused by an in-service injury, event, or illness? Please explain why or why not, specifically considering and discussing:

1) the Veteran's April 1984 STR indicating a PIP fracture on the 5th finger, with a deformity noted;

2) the Veteran's April 1988 STR documenting a laceration on the left hand, avulsion of tip of left thumb;

3) the Veteran's January 2, 1990 STR indicating he "accidentally cut finger index tip on knife while working" in mess hall, superficial skin flap laceration noted, left hand 2nd digit; 

4) the Veteran's 1994 Report of Medical History-ETS denoting his report that he was admitted in Germany for a broken thumb around February 4, 1986;

5) the Veteran's April 18, 1995 Report of Medical Examination-National Guard enlistment, documenting "scar rt thumb;" and

6) the Veteran's April 18, 1995 Report of Medical History-National Guard enlistment, denoting his report of "stitches, hands."

Please include a complete rationale for the opinions provided. If you cannot provide the requested opinions without resorting to speculation, please expressly indicate this and state why it is so.
