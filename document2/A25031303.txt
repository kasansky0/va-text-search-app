REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for Parkinson-like symptoms is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from June 1966 to April 1970.  The Veteran passed away in June 2022.  The Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In May 2023, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2022 decision.  In September 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2022 decision.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for Parkinson-like symptoms, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for Parkinson's like symptoms is remanded.

The Appellant contends that the Veteran's Parkinson's-like disability is due to the Veteran's conceded Agent Orange exposure during service.  See September 2024 Notice of Disagreement.

For the reasons stated below, the Board finds that to remedy pre-decisional duty to assist errors, a remand is warranted. 

First, a remand is warranted to remedy the pre-decisional duty to assist error of failing to obtain a medical opinion pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act).  See 38 U.S.C. § 1168.  

The PACT Act requires that, when a veteran whose active service subjected the veteran to participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) files a claim to service connect a disability and there is evidence of such disability, VA must provide the veteran with a VA examination and obtain a medical opinion addressing the possibility of a nexus between the claimed disability and the TERA. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a)(1). 

The September 2023 rating decision made the favorable findings that the Veteran had been diagnosed with axonal sensorimotor neuropathy and cervical radiculopathy, and in-service Agent Orange herbicide exposure is conceded due to the Veteran's service at U-Tapoa Royal Thai Air Force Base in 1968.  Because the Board is unable to grant this claim at this time, and because the requirements to obtain a medical opinion compliant with 38 U.S.C. § 1168 are met, but such opinion has not yet been obtained, a remand is needed for VA to obtain one. 

Next, despite the presumed exposure, the Board reflects that early demyelinating polyneuropathy is not among the list of diseases for which service connection will be presumed.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e).  However, clarification should be obtained from the VA examiner upon remand as to whether the diagnosis of early demyelinating polyneuropathy is considered early onset peripheral neuropathy, as early onset peripheral neuropathy is one of the presumed diseases.  

Even though the Veteran may not be entitled to presumptive service connection, the Board must still engage in a direct analysis.  See Combee v. Principi, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

Therefore, the Board finds a remand is warranted to also remedy the predecisional duty to assist error of failing to obtain an adequate VA opinion regarding direct service connection prior to the rating decision on appeal.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2021.  The VA examiner explained that no diagnosis of Parkinson's or Parkinsonism was found.  However, the examiner did note that the Veteran had been diagnosed with early demyelinating polyneuropathy.  The examiner did not provide a nexus opinion.

Once VA undertakes the effort to provide a medical examination or opinion, it must provide an adequate one.  Barr v. Nicholson, 2 Vet. App. 303, 311-12 (2007).

As the VA examiner did not provide a nexus opinion, while noting a diagnosis of early demyelinating polyneuropathy, the Board finds the October 2021 VA examination inadequate for adjudicatory purposes.  

Therefore, a remand is warranted. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a VA opinion that addresses:  

(a.) Is the Veteran's diagnosis of early demyelinating polyneuropathy, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, and/or cervical radiculopathy, at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to the Veteran's conceded in-service exposure to Agent Orange during his service at U-Tapoa Royal Thai Air Force Base in 1968?  

(b.) Is early demyelinating polyneuropathy, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, and/or cervical radiculopathy, considered the same as early onset peripheral neuropathy?
