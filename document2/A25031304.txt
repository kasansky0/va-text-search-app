ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 1, 2022 for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence weighs persuasively against an effective date earlier than December 1, 2022 for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

2. The Veteran's original claim for PTSD was denied in a September 2017 rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal the decision or submit new and material evidence within one year.

3. The September 2017 rating decision is final.

4. The Veteran's December 1, 2022 VA Form 20-0995 supplemental claim is the earliest communication that can be construed as a petition to reopen the previously denied PTSD claim.

5. The Veteran's PTSD was diagnosed concurrently with the filing of the December 1, 2022 claim. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date for service connection for PTSD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5107, 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1. 3.104, 3.105, 3.155, 3.156, 3.400, 19.52, 20.1103.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1968 to June 1970. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

An August 2023 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD and assigned a 30 percent rating effective December 1, 2022. The Veteran submitted a July 2024 supplemental claim to appeal the effective date. Despite finding that new and relevant evidence had not been received, the October 2024 rating decision nevertheless substantively decided the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date based on the merits. Therefore, the Board need not address whether new and relevant evidence has been received. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). 

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2024 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the rating decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The December 2024 VA Form 10182 and lay statement asserted clear and unmistakable error (CUE) occurred in the September 2017 rating decision. See December 2024 VA Form 10182; December 2024 Lay Statement. Although the Veteran's July 2024 supplemental claim and lay statement asserted the issue of CUE, the October 2024 rating decision on appeal did not adjudicate the issue of CUE. See July 2024 VA Form 20-0995; July 2024 Lay Statement. The motion seeking revision on the basis of CUE is separate from entitlement to an earlier effective date and must be adjudicated by the AOJ in the first instance. See 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006). An assertion of CUE is a motion or a request, not a theory of entitlement that can be considered part of another claim. See, e.g., Hillyard v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 343, 355 (2011). Therefore, the Board cannot adjudicate the issue of CUE. The Veteran may resubmit the July 2024 supplemental claim to the AOJ or notify the AOJ that the issue is still pending. 

Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless otherwise provided. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. There is an exception in that the effective date of an increase in disability compensation is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the claim is received within one year from such date. Id.

For AMA appeals, the effective date will be the date VA received a Veteran's initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a Veteran continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h)(1). Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing administrative review options after any decision by the AOJ, Board, or U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).

When direct service connection is granted, the effective date may be the day following separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose, if a claim is received within one year after separation from service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i). Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Id.

A claim must be filed in the form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (a). "Claim" means a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p) (2019).

An earlier effective date for service connection for PTSD.

The Veteran seeks an effective date of April 21, 2017, for service connection for PTSD. See July 2024 VA Form 20-0995; December 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran asserts VA did not ensure the August 2017 VA medical examination was adequate, the opinion's rationale is not consistent with the medical and lay evidence, and the examiner was removed from his position at VA after an internal VA investigation found the examiner intentionally provided negative medical nexus opinions for Veterans' claims. See July 2024 Lay Statement; December 2024 Lay Statement. The Veteran's service-connected PTSD is currently assigned a 30 percent rating effective December 1, 2022, the date of the Veteran's supplemental claim. See August 2023 Rating Decision.

The Veteran first submitted a claim for service connection for PTSD on April 21, 2017. See April 2017 VA Form 21-526EZ. A September 2017 rating decision denied the claim. See September 2017 Rating Decision. Under VA's legacy appeals system, appellate review is initiated by filing a timely notice of disagreement (NOD) in writing, and after a statement of the case (SOC) has been furnished, is completed by filing a timely substantive appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.200, 20.201 (2018). A claimant or his/her representative must file a NOD within one year from the date VA mailed NOD. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302 (a) (2018). A NOD must be a "written communication from the claimant or her representative expressing dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative determination by the agency of original jurisdiction and a desire to contest the result." 38 C.F.R. § 20.201. If a NOD is not filed within the one-year time period, the AOJ's decision becomes final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160 (d), 20.200, 20.201, 20.302, 20.1103 (2018). The Veteran did not file a NOD during the one-year period following the September 2017 rating decision. Additionally, no new and material evidence was received within the one-year time period following the September 2017 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. 3.156(b). Thus, the September 2017 rating decision denying service connection for PTSD became final. 

Previous determinations that are final and binding, including decisions of service connection, will be accepted as correct in the absence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a). As discussed above, the AOJ has not decided the issue of CUE, which must be determined by the AOJ in the first instance, so CUE is not at issue in this appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006).  

Following the September 2017 rating decision, Veteran did not file a supplemental claim for service connection for PTSD until December 1, 2022. See December 2022 VA Form 20-0995. The Veteran's March 2021 supplemental claim sought entitlement to service connection for left hip and right ankle but did not seek entitlement to service connection for PTSD. See March 2021 VA Form 20-0995; March 2021 Lay Statement. The March 2021 Form DD215 shows a correction reflecting the Veteran's receipt of the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Vietnam Service Medal with three Bronze Service Stars, as well as other medals that show the Veteran served in combat in the Republic of Vietnam. See March 2021 DD215; March 2021 DD214. However, the Veteran did not assert entitlement to service connection for PTSD when he submitted the March 2021 supplemental claim, and VA is not required to anticipate any potential claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998); Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995). Therefore, December 1, 2022 is the earliest claim date for service connection for PTSD. 

The Veteran's entitlement to service connection for PTSD was established concurrently with his December 2022 supplemental claim. The June 2023 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD, indicating the Veteran's PTSD is the result of fear of hostile military activity that the Veteran experienced during his service as a combat infantryman in the Republic of Vietnam. See June 2023 VA Examination. Thus, entitlement to service connection for PTSD was established with the Veteran's December 1, 2022 supplemental claim. Therefore, the earliest effective date that can be assigned to entitlement to service connection for PTSD is December 1, 2022. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

The Veteran's lay statements do not weigh in favor of an effective date earlier than December 1, 2022 for service connection for PTSD. See July 2024 Lay Statement; December 2024 Lay Statement. Veterans are competent to provide evidence of that which they experience. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). The Veteran is competent to emphasize the ways in which the April 2017 VA examiner's findings conflict with the medical and lay evidence of record, but the Veteran is not competent to assess events occurring outside of his experience, including VA examinations other than his own or internal VA investigations. See July 2024 Lay Statement; December 2024 Lay Statement. The Veteran's assertion that the August 2017 VA examination conflicts with other evidence is credible but does not support a finding that the September 2017 rating decision did not become final. Therefore, the Veteran's competent, credible statements do not weigh in favor of entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 1, 2022 for service connection for PTSD.

For the above reasons, the probative evidence weighs against the claim and demonstrates the appropriate effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD remains December 1, 2022, the date VA received the Veteran's supplemental claim. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply and an effective date earlier than December 1, 2022 for service connection for PTSD is not warranted.
