FINDING OF FACT

On July 24, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran's representative that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.? 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for?withdrawal?of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.?38 U.S.C. § 7105;?38 C.F.R. § 20.205.? 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from March 1986 to March 1987, from February 1991 to October 1991, and from November 1991 to February 1992. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The Veteran filed a July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and selected the?Direct Review?docket. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.?38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.?38 C.F.R. § 20.205.?Withdrawal?may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized?representative.?38 C.F.R. § 20.205. In the present case, the Veteran, through her authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal in a July 2024 letter and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
