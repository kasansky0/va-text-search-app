ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.  

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for service-connected mallet finger, fifth digit is denied.  

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for service-connected mallet finger, fourth digit is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. After the appeal was initiated, a June 2024 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  As this rating action represented a complete grant of the benefits sought on appeal, there is no remaining case or controversy pertaining to the currently pending claim.

2. The Veteran's right little finger disability manifested by reduced range of motion with pain, but without favorable or unfavorable ankylosis.

3. The Veteran's right ring finger disability manifested by reduced range of motion with pain, but without favorable or unfavorable ankylosis.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal pertaining entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

2. The criteria for a compensable rating for mallet finger, fifth digit disability, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes (DCs) 5230, 5024-5230.

3. The criteria for a compensable rating for mallet finger, fourth digit disability, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, DCs 5230, 5024-5230.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service with the Army from September 1987 to April 1994. 

A rating decision was issued under the Legacy system in March 2013 denying entitlement to service connection for a right-hand disability, finger disability, and tinnitus.  The Veteran timely submitted a notice of disagreement, and a statement of the case was issued in May 2016.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and it became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.

In October 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting entitlement to service connection for dislocated fingers resulting in pain and disfigurement, a right-hand injury, and ringing in the ears.  In January 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision finding no new and relevant evidence to reconsider the Veteran's claims for entitlement to service connection for dislocated fingers resulting in pain and disfigurement, percentage of loss of right hand, and ringing in the ears.  This constituted an initial decision, therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeal Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In March 2022, the VA received the Veteran's intent to file and subsequently the same month a VA Form 20-0995 seeking entitlement to service connection for dislocated fingers resulting in pain and disfigurement, a right-hand injury, and ringing in the ears.  A June 2022 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for mallet finger, fifth digit at a noncompensable rate effective October 22, 2021, and mallet finger, fourth digit at a noncompensable rate effective October 22, 2021.  The AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  In June 2022, the VA received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD), electing Direct Review of the June 2022 rating decision.  

The Board notes that the Veteran subsequently also submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, requesting increased ratings for his injury to the right hand/two fingers.  A February 2023 rating decision was issued denying entitlement to compensable evaluations for the right-hand mallet fingers of the fifth and fourth digits.  

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 requesting reconsideration of the claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  A June 2024 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for tinnitus at 10 percent disabling effective February 16, 2024.  

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that in a March 2022 report of general information the Veteran requested expedited processing of his claim due to homelessness.  To request to have his appeal reviewed sooner than its place on the Board's docket would normally allow he could request to have the appeal "Advanced on the Docket," which would require a brief explanation of the reasons why the case should be prioritized (i.e., advanced age (defined as 75 years or more), serious illness, severe financial hardship, or administrative error resulting in a significant delay).  Any motion for advancement should be supported by pertinent documentation.  

A review of the record showed in January 2022 he reported to VA treating providers that he was without stable housing and staying with various friends and his mother.  In February 2022, he was waiting on a voucher for HUD-VASH to be issued to him.  By March 2022, homelessness was listed as an inactive problem by his VA treating providers because he was incarcerated and unable to participate in the homelessness programing.  May 2022 VA treatment records showed the Veteran being referred for GPD placement and living at a VOA shelter.  By the end of May, he had received his HUD-VASH voucher and reported looking at housing.  In November 2022, he was evicted for non-payment of rent and reported temporarily staying with his mother while he received treatment from the Healing Place following a relapse in his sobriety.  In January 2023, he was working part-time through a security agency.  The Veteran was getting ready to move into a lease to buy house by September 2023.  

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's financial hardship is not so severe as to warrant an advancement on the docket.  Additionally, neither the Veteran nor his representative submitted an AOD motion with relevant supporting evidence.  Therefore, the appeal will remain in its current docket number order.  However, the Board notes that this determination does not prevent the Veteran from filing an AOD motion and submitting relevant supporting evidence in the future.

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

Generally, the Board has jurisdiction over questions of law or fact on appeal to the Secretary.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.101(d).  The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege a specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  As noted above, the VA received a VA Form 10182 appealing entitlement to service connection for tinnitus in June 2022.  Subsequently, a June 2024 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  Since the Regional Office (RO) fully granted the benefit sought on appeal in the June 2024 rating decision, there is no remaining allegation of law or fact for appellate consideration.  Therefore, the Board is without jurisdiction to review the appeal and the Veteran's appeal for service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for service-connected mallet finger, fifth digit is denied.  

3. Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for service-connected mallet finger, fourth digit is denied.

Applicable Law and Regulations

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentages contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Separate evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found.  In other words, the evaluations may be "staged."  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (staged ratings are appropriate when the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.); see also Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (2001).  A disability may require re-evaluation in accordance with changes in a veteran's condition.  It is thus essential, in determining the level of current impairment, that the disability be considered in the context of the entire recorded history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

From October 22, 2021, the Veteran's mallet finger disabilities were rated under DC 5230. 

From January 20, 2023, the Veteran's mallet finger disabilities were rated under DC 5024-5230.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the assigned rating.  The hyphenated disability will be rated by analogy under a diagnostic code for a closely related disability that affects the same anatomical functions and has closely analogous symptomatology.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4.27. 

The hyphenated diagnostic code indicates that the Veteran's tenosynovitis, tendinitis, tendinosis, or tendinopathy (DC 5024) was rated under the criteria for limitation of motion ring or little finger (DC 5230).  

Under DC 5024, which evaluates tenosynovitis, a disability will be rated on limitation of motion of affected parts, as degenerative arthritis.  Degenerative arthritis is rated under DC 5003, which provides that, when the limitation of motion of the specific joint or joints involved is noncompensable under the appropriate diagnostic code for that joint, a rating of 10 percent is for application for each such major joint or group of minor joints affected by (noncompensable) limitation of motion.  In the absence of limitation of motion, a 20 percent rating is provided where there is x-ray evidence of involvement of two or more major joints, or two or more minor joint groups with occasional incapacitating exacerbations.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5003.  The hand, which includes involvement of the interphalangeal, metacarpal and carpal joints of the upper extremities, is considered a group of minor joints.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45(f).

Under DC 5230, which evaluates limitation of motion of the ring or little finger, the Board notes that this code only provides a noncompensable evaluation for all limitations of motion (whether on the major (dominant) or minor (non-dominant) hand.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Therefore, the Veteran is already in receipt of the maximum disability rating available under DC 5230.

The Board notes that the revisions to the rating schedule that took effect February 7, 2021, with respect to the musculoskeletal system did not change DCs 5216-5230, relating to finger disabilities.

When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (reasonable doubt to be resolved in the Veteran's favor); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (the benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies if the competing evidence is in approximate balance).

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran asserts entitlement to an increased ratings for his service-connected mallet finger disabilities. 

In March 2022, the Veteran reported to VA treating providers that he experienced increased chronic right hand and finger pain with a change in his grasp.  He denied recent injury, redness, swelling, or tingling to the hand.  He reported decreased range of motion in the last two months of the fourth and fifth digits with some pain with maximal range of motion.  Physical examination found the right hand fourth and fifth digits with flexor contractions, greater in the fourth than the fifth finger.  The Veteran was unable to fully extend the fifth digit.  There was also evidence of some fibrosis of the flexor tendons to these digits.  The treating providers noted no tenosynovitis or joint swelling.  

A June 2022 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with mallet fingers of the right hand.  The Veteran reported he could not fully straighten out the fourth and fifth digits on the right hand.  He was unable to grip or write for a long period of time due to pain.  He reported pain with repetitive use and felt like the hand locked up requiring him to work out the stiffness.  The Veteran reported flare ups in the right hand daily, which were moderate to severe in severity and lasted minutes.  The VA examiner found no gap between the pad of the thumb and fingers, no gap between the finger and proximal transverse crease of the hand on maximal finger flexion, and no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue.  However, there was evidence of pain during examination with active and passive motion in the ring and little fingers on the right hand, but it did not result in or cause functional loss.  

The Veteran could perform repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions and without additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions.  He was not examined immediately after repeated use over time or during a flare up.  The evidence suggested that pain significantly limited his functional ability with repeated use over time or during a flare up.  However, the estimated gap between the pad of the thumb and fingers immediately after repeated use over time or during a flare up remained zero centimeters (cm).  The VA examiner noted the PIP of the fourth digit and the DIP of the fifth digit were unable to fully straighten, which were additional factors contributing to his disability.  Despite these findings, the Veteran retained five out of five grip strength, showed no evidence of muscle atrophy, and no evidence of ankylosis.  The VA examiner opined the Veteran's finger disability impacted his ability to perform any type of occupational task.  He was unable to write or grip for long periods of time due to pain and could not complete repetitive motions due to pain.  The June 2022 VA examiner had access to the claims file and was sufficiently informed of the relevant facts including the Veteran's lay statements so as to be able to form an appropriate medical opinion.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  Therefore, this opinion was accorded positive probative value.

The Veteran is already in receipt of the maximum disability rating available under DC 5230, and a higher rating is not possible under this DC.  Although the Veteran experiences pain, functional loss, and some limitation of motion, a compensable rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not for application when the applicable DC does not provide a compensable rating.  See Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472, 480 (2016); Petitti v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 415, 428-29 (2015) (a compensable rating is warranted for joint pain pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 for orthopedic disabilities, but only if they are rated under diagnostic codes containing a compensable rating).

The Board has therefore considered whether separate ratings are warranted under other potentially pertinent diagnostic codes.  A review of the file does not reflect the Veteran's fourth and fifth fingers of the right hand were ankylosed nor are they analogous to an amputation for consideration under DCs 5216 through 5227, and DCs 5153 and 5154.  Ankylosis is stiffening or fixation of a joint as the result of a disease process, with fibrous or bony union across the joint.  Dinsay v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 79, 81 (1996).  Ankylosis is medically defined as immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure.  The Board observes that consideration must be given to whether the Veteran is functionally ankylosed in the right fourth and fifth fingers.  See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 15-18 (2021).  The Veteran's lay assertions were considered.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  To the extent that the Veteran has argued that higher ratings are warranted for the right finger disabilities, these assertions are outweighed by more probative evidence provided by the examination of a qualified medical professional.  See Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134, 137-138 (1994).  As such, his lay statements do not provide any basis upon which to assign any higher rating.

As such, the Board concludes that the evidence of record is against increased ratings, is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Therefore, entitlement to initial compensable evaluations for the mallet finger disabilities of the right hand are not warranted.
