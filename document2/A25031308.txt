REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1964 to February 1965.

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the issue of entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer most recently addressed in a June 2022 Board decision.  In June 27, 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. 

In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2024 supplemental claim decision.  In September 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 27, 2024 decision.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. In response to a December 2024 Board letter, the Veteran waived his right to select a different review option. See Correspondence (option 2024). See also, Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 supplemental claim decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c). 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b).

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his prostate cancer is due to in-service exposures, including to contaminated water and/or dioxins during his service at Camp LeJeune. See VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim (July 2018); Form 9 (December 2019). In support of his contentions, in March 2022, the Veteran submitted multiple articles, including Trichloroethylene CAS No. 79-01-6. See Correspondence (February 2024).

Favorable findings from the March 2024 rating decision include (1) diagnosis of prostate cancer and (2) exposure to contaminated water during his service at Camp LeJeune. A February 2024 VA Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) memorandum also found that the Veteran participated in TERA, based on his service at Camp LeJeune and included exposure to water contamination, specifically, perchloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), vinyl chloride and benzene. See other (February 2024). 

The issue of entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is remanded to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the September 2024 rating decision on appeal. 

First, VA's duty to assist claimants in the development of their claims included obtaining an examination and/or opinion when necessary to decide the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Further, once an examination or opinion is obtained, VA must ensure that it is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that it is adequate). 

Here, prior to the decision on appeal, VA-obtained multiple examinations and opinions (VAMOs). See C&P exam (February 2022); C&P Exam (April 2022); C&P Exam (March 2024). The AOJ obtained medical opinions, all are inadequate to decide the matter.

A February 2022 VAMO obtained without an examination reflects that the prostate cancer "is less likely as not caused by or a result of" the Veteran's exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. See C&P Exam at 2 (February 2022). The rationale was that:

ATSDR [Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry] and medical and scientific literature of epidemiologic rigor, does not show an association between the two events. Claimant has some risk factors for this condition, as well. Taking that into account, we conclude that the claimed condition is less likely as not (less than 50/50 probability) caused by or a result of the Veteran's exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.

Further, the VAMO provides that:

ATSDR  concludes that there is some evidence for a positive association between TCE and prostate cancer. However, the findings from the cohort and case-control studies are mixed with several studies finding no elevated risk. Therefore, ATSDR concludes that there is below equipoise evidence for causation for TCE and prostate cancer. Conclusion: ATSDR concludes that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether an association exists between PCE exposure and prostate cancer. Therefore, ATSDR concludes that there is below equipoise evidence for causation for PCE and prostate cancer. Therefore, ATSDR concludes that there is below equipoise evidence for causation for vinyl chloride and prostate cancer.

An April 2022 VAMO reflects that the Veteran's prostate cancer was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event or illness. The rationale was that:

The veteran had a prostate cancer treated in 2004 by prostatectomy. According to available peer-reviewed medical literature, there is no link between exposure to the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune and prostate cancer. The risk factors for prostate cancer include family history, age, race, hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome, Agent orange exposure and eating habits.

See C&P Exam at 2 (April 2024).

A March 2024 VAMO addressing the Veteran's TERA's concluded that prostate cancer "is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service connected condition." The rationale was that:

Menigioma's [sic] as well as prostate cancer, have been addressed previously, and are enot [sic] caused by the presumed exposures at lejeune[sic]. The literature simply doesn't suppport [sic] it. Nor are menigiomas [sic] due to head trauma. See previous opiniomn [sic] whhich [sic] are very clear and I cocur [sic] with them.

See C&P Exam at 4 (March 2024).

The Board finds that these VAMOs are inadequate to decide the claim. None of the VAMOs supports the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate for the Board to consider and weigh against other evidence of record. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007).

First, the February 2022 VAMO is internally incongruent, stating that medical and scientific literature "does not show an association," between prostate cancer and contaminated water at Camp LeJeune, while later in the same opinion stating that there is some evidence for a positive association between TCE and prostate cancer. Additionally, the VAMO does not answer why the risk factors of age and family history more likely caused the Veteran's prostate cancer than his exposure to toxins, such as TCE, when stationed at Camp Lejeune. In cases involving chemical exposure and cancer, the examiner's rationale may not be based solely on general medical articles. Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 54, 60 (2018). 

The April 2022 and March 2024 VAMOs are inadequate as the essential rationale is missing. Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012). The VAMOs appear to rely on the absence of medical literature supporting causation, and the April 2022 opinion strongly relies on general risk factors, but does not discuss the medical literature vis-à-vis any facts specific to this Veteran, to include his specific risk factors for prostate cancer. See Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 54, 60 (2018). Further the March 2024 opinion addressing the Veteran's TERAs does not reflect consideration the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran. Instead, the VAMO vaguely states that prostate cancer is not presumed to be caused by exposures at Camp LeJeune. See C&P Exam at 5 (March 2024). 

Second, VA's duty to assist claimants includes obtaining records in the custody of a Federal department or agency and making reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records not in the custody of a Federal department or agency, to include records from private medical care providers. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2).

Here, prior to the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran's VA treatment records indicated that there were non-VA medical records that had been scanned into VistA, including January 26, 2017 (non-VA note from High Point Family Practice); January 10, 2020 (community care consult result note); June 29, 2017, and May 8, 2019 (outside medical records (non-VA note laboratory results Wake Forest Baptist Health); and November 5, 2018, and March 29, 2019 (outside medical records). See CAPRI at 284, 294, 214, 333, 353 (May 2022). However, copies of these scanned records were not associated with the claim file prior to issuing the decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b), (c); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); see also Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist errors on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A , which occurred prior to the October 2023 rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Lastly, the Board acknowledges the Veteran-obtained favorable medical opinion, from M.R.K., M.D (March 2022), which provides that the Veteran's exposure to "water contamination at Camp Lejeune from 1964-1970" and this "could contribute to the fact that he has developed three separate neoplasms." See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 1 (March 2022). This opinion is inadequate because has the Veteran's dates of exposure incorrect, adding five more years, and it is speculative. it relies on incorrect facts. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 460, 461 (1993) (an opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value). See also, Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999) (use of term "could," without other rationale or supporting data, is speculative); Goss v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 109, 114 (1996) (use of the phrase "could not rule out" was too speculative to establish medical nexus); Tirpak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 609, 611 (1992) (medical opinions are speculative and of little or no probative value when a clinician makes equivocal findings).

In remanding this matter, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions. Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate copies of all treatment records from private treatment providers that have been scanned into the VistA Imaging system with the Veteran's claims folder, including from

(a.) January 26, 2017 (non-VA note from High Point Family Practice); 

(b.) January 10, 2020 (community care consult result note); 

(c.) June 29, 2017, and May 8, 2019 (outside medical records (non-VA note laboratory results Wake Forest Baptist Health); and 

(d.) November 5, 2018, and March 29, 2019 (outside medical records).

2. Obtain an addendum opinion addressing the etiology of the Veteran's prostate cancer. The entire claims file, to include a copy of this REMAND, should be made available to and reviewed by the clinician. The phrase "at least as likely as not" means the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal.

NOTE (1): A negative opinion should not be predicated on the absence of prostate cancer on the list of diseases enumerated as presumptively associated with contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune.

NOTE (2): An adequate medical opinion may not be predicated solely on medical literature to support a negative conclusion without discussing those facts specific to this Veteran; and may not rely solely on the absence of medical literature without explaining how or why this is dispositive.

The clinician should address the following:

(a.) Whether the Veran's prostate cancer is, at least as likely as not, related to the Veteran's in-service exposure to PCE, TCE, vinyl chloride and/or benzene through the water supply at Camp Lejeune between October 20, 1964, and February 3, 1965, to include whether the exposure to one or more of these toxins shared in the causation or his development of any prostate cancer. Explain.

When providing this opinion, the clinician must consider:

i.	the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and

ii.	the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

(b.) Is Veteran's prostate cancer clearly due to or the result of another etiology? If yes, identify and fully explain.

The opinion should identify the Veteran's risk factors associated with his diagnosed prostate cancer (e.g. age, family history, etc.) and address their role if any in the Veteran's development of any prostate cancer.
