ORDER

Service connection for a disability manifested by dizziness as secondary to service connected migraines is denied.

A compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The competent medical evidence does not demonstrate a diagnosis of a disability manifested by dizziness.

2. During the appeal period, the Veteran had, at its highest degree of severity, Level I hearing impairment in both ears.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a disability manifested by dizziness have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

2. The criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.10, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 2009 to May 2010. 

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from October 18, 2023 and October 31, 2023 rating decisions. The Veteran requested a higher level review (HLR) of these rating decisions. The HLR decision denied the claims in April 2024, and the Veteran timely appealed the April 2024 rating decision to the Board, requesting the Direct Review Docket. This means that the Board, in adjudicating this appeal, may only review the evidence that was of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decisions. To the extent evidence was received after that time, the Board may not consider it unless a supplemental claim is received that either identifies or resubmits the evidence.

i) Service connection for a disability manifested by dizziness as secondary to migraines is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a disability manifested by dizziness. He claims that he has a disability manifested by dizziness that is secondary to his service-connected migraines. See VA Form 21-526 EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) and VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, each received by VA in May 2023. 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

With chronic disease shown as such in service so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b). For the showing of chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. Id. When the disease identity is established, there is no requirement of evidentiary showing of continuity. Id. For this purpose, a chronic disease is one listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a). See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding that the term "chronic disease" in 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) is limited to a chronic disease listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a)).

Additionally, a disability which is proximately due to, or the result of a service-connected disease or injury shall be service connected. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Additionally, when aggravation of a Veteran's nonservice-connected condition is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected condition, the Veteran shall be compensated for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

In this appeal, there is no evidence of a confirmed diagnosis of a disability manifested by dizziness. The Veteran's service treatment records, as well as post-service VA and private treatment and examination reports, are silent to any complaints of dizziness, imbalance or periods of unconsciousness. Notably, a July 2023 VA Headache Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) did not contain any clinician findings of dizziness and/or imbalance as a symptom(s) of the Veteran's service-connected headaches. See July 2023 Headache DBQ, received by VA in September 2023, at page (pg.) 3)). In the absence of proof of present disability there can be no successful claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the requirement for service connection that a current disability be present is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudicate on of the claim. See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

In Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) held that where pain causes functional impairment, a disability for VA compensation purposes exists, even if there is no underlying diagnosis. In sum, pain alone resulting in functional impairment may in fact be considered a disability and should not be summarily discounted as a bar to benefits based on a finding of no current diagnosis. However, here, the Veteran does not claim, nor do the medical records show, that he experiences any functional impairment of earning capacity as a result of a disability manifested by dizziness. As such, Saunders is not applicable to this claim.

The Veteran is considered competent to report the observable manifestations. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994). However, he lacks the medical training or expertise to diagnose a chronic medical condition. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Accordingly, his statements are not found to be sufficient to establish the presence of a disabling disability manifested by dizziness.

The Veteran has not been afforded an examination in connection with his claim seeking service connection for his disability manifested by dizziness that is separate from the July 2023 headache examination, but VA does not have a duty to provide one, as there is no indication that the Veteran even has a diagnosable condition with such symptomatology that may be associated with his service. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006). Accordingly, without supporting records, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have, and has not had during the appeal period, a disability manifested by dizziness. In the absence of competent supporting evidence, a VA examination also is not required. Service connection for a disability manifested by dizziness is denied. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

ii) A compensable rating for a bilateral hearing loss disability is denied.

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss. 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part IV.  If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Under the applicable criteria, ratings for hearing loss are determined in accordance with the findings obtained on audiometric evaluations. Ratings for hearing impairment range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of controlled speech discrimination tests, together with the average hearing threshold level as measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 cycles per second. To evaluate the degree of disability from hearing impairment, the rating schedule establishes eleven auditory acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal acuity through Level XI for profound deafness. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

Hearing tests will be conducted without hearing aids, and the results of above-described testing are charted on Table VI and Table VII. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

Exceptional patterns of hearing impairment are evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86.

(a) When the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 hertz) is 55 decibels or more, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever results in the higher numeral. Each ear will be evaluated separately. 

(b) When the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever results in the higher numeral. That numeral will then be elevated to the next higher Roman numeral. Each ear will be evaluated separately.

As noted above, under VA rating criteria, an adequate evaluation of impairment of hearing acuity rests upon the results of controlled speech discrimination tests, together with tests of the average hearing threshold levels at certain specified frequencies. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

Pertinent case law provides that the assignment of disability ratings for hearing impairment is to be derived by the mechanical application of the Ratings Schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometry evaluations are rendered. Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

Pertinent evidence includes a September 2023 VA audiological evaluation. 

Audiometric testing to include, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, and speech recognition scores were reported as follows:

	HERTZ	CNC

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	%

RIGHT	30	40	45	35	38	100

LEFT	35	35	40	35	36	98

With regard to a schedular rating, when applying the method for evaluating hearing loss to the results of the Veteran's audiological evaluations, the September 2023 audiometric evaluation revealed Level I hearing acuity in both ears, based on application of the reported findings to Table VI. Application of these findings to Table VII corresponds to an initial noncompensable disability rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

As the September 2023 VA audiological evaluation does not reflect that the Veteran had 55 decibels or more in all pure tone thresholds of either ear from 1000-4000 Hertz, or 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, exceptional hearing impairment has not been demonstrated in either ear at the September 2023 evaluation and, thus, 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 is not for application in the appeal.

The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements and reports of hearing loss for this period on appeal. Notably, in Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447, 455 (2007), it was the holding of CAVC that in addition to dictating objective test results, a VA audiologist must fully describe the functional effects caused by a hearing disability in his or her final report. In this regard, it was noted, during the Veteran's September 2023 audiological evaluation, that his hearing loss had interfered with his ability to hear in background noise. See September 2023 VA Hearing Loss DBQ at pg. 6.

While the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's assertions that he has difficulty hearing, the VA rating criteria are definitive and provide for a precise result based on audiometric test results. His subjective report of difficulty hearing under situational circumstances unfortunately cannot be the basis for an evaluative rating. The Board is bound to apply the VA rating schedule, under which the rating criteria are defined by audiometric test findings involving hearing acuity in a controlled laboratory environment. The rating criteria are designed to evaluate difficulty hearing, the complaint put forth by the Veteran.

As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for service-connected bilateral hearing loss, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  The claim must be denied.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.
