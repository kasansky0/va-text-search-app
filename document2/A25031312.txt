REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 50 percent for a psychiatric disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Air Force from August 2000 to October 2007 and from December 2016 to January 2017.  

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) decision on their claim to seek review.? The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.?38?C.F.R. §?3.2400(a)(1).? The AMA applies to all?initial?decisions issued after February 19, 2019.?? 

The present matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 higher-level review (HLR) decision issued by VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).? Accordingly, this decision is subject to the AMA.

The Veteran's initial increased rating claim was denied in a January 2024 rating decision.  In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR).  In June 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the initial rating decision.  

Next, the Veteran timely appealed the HLR decision to the Board in a July 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. The Veteran requested the direct review docket, which limits the Board's review to evidence of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal.

1. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 50 percent for a psychiatric disability.

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). For the reasons set forth below, the Board finds that remand is warranted to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

In December 2023, the Veteran filed an initial increased rating claim for his depressive disorder.  In April 2023, the Veteran reported to his private doctor in that he was in psychotherapy.  He also reported to a VA examiner in January 2024 that he has seen the same therapist since 2021.  These records are not in the record, and the AOJ made no attempts to obtain them before deciding his increased rating claim.  The Board finds that failure to obtain these records constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand is necessary.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. The AOJ should provide the Veteran with an opportunity to provide authorization to release any private records related to treatment for his depression, including psychotherapy.  

2. After completing the preceding development, the AOJ should re-adjudicate the claim.
