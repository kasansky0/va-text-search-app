REMANDED

The matter of whether the retroactive termination of payment of additional Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits for A. effective January 1, 2014, was proper, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from July 2011 to December 2013.

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2023 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which retroactively terminated payment of a dependency allowance for A. effective January 1, 2014.  This action resulted in an overpayment in the amount of $9,369.  

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), on which he identified the October 2023 decision and elected the Direct Review Docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Overpayment Debt

The law provides for the rates of disability compensation, and for payment of additional compensation for dependents of veterans who are at least 30 percent disabled.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114 (c), 1115, 1134, 1135.

In March 2013, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-686c, Declaration of Status of Dependents, on which he reported that he and A. had married in October 2012.  

In a March 2014 rating decision, the RO awarded the Veteran VA compensation at the 50 percent rate, effective December 31, 2013.  In a March 2014 letter, he was notified of the decision and further advised that he had been awarded additional compensation for A.  He was advised to let the RO know right away of any changes in his marital status, including divorce.  He was also provided a VA Form 21-8764 which reiterated that additional benefits were included for his spouse and that failure to notify the RO in a prompt fashion of a dependency change would result in an overpayment.

In October 2017, a friend of the Veteran's telephoned VA to reported that the Veteran had been incarcerated.  VA attempted to locate incarceration information, but was unable to verify that the Veteran was incarcerated.  

In November 2017, the RO sent the Veteran correspondence to his address of record (on S. Drive).  The mail was returned as undeliverable.  A new address for the Veteran was never resolved.  Subsequent correspondence sent to the same address in November 2018, November 2019, November 2020, and November 2021, however, was not returned as undeliverable.  

In April 2022, the RO sent the Veteran a letter to his address of record reminding him that his VA compensation included an additional amount for dependents.  He was asked to complete and return an enclosed dependency form within 60 days.  This letter was not returned as undeliverable.  He did not respond.  

In an August 2022 letter, also mailed to his address of record, the RO proposed to remove A. from his award effective January 1, 2014, based on his failure to provide verification of his dependents.  He was advised that he could submit evidence showing that the change should not be made within 60 days.  The RO explained that if it did not receive additional evidence from him within 60 days, it would take the proposed action.  The letter was not returned as undeliverable.  

In November 2022, the RO began sending correspondence to the Veteran at a different address (on C. Drive).   None of the subsequent correspondence was returned as undeliverable.  

In an April 2023 letter, mailed to the Veteran at the new address (on C. Drive), the RO advised him that A. had been removed from his VA compensation award effective April 1, 2023 because he failed to confirm continued dependency.  The April 1, 2023, date was to prevent accrual of an additional overpayment.  The RO again provided the Veteran with a VA Form 21-686c, Declaration of Status of Dependents, for the Veteran to complete and return.  The RO advised the Veteran that if the RO did not receive this form in the next 90 days, it would take the action proposed in the letter dated August 10, 2022 to remove his dependent spouse A. effective January 1, 2014.  He was told that this adjustment would result in an overpayment of benefits which had been paid to him, and if the proposed decision was implemented, he would be notified of the exact amount of the overpayment and given information about repayment.  He was also told that the RO might be able to reinstate benefits for his dependent(s) back to the earliest possible effective date if he submitted the requested dependent verification within a year from the date of this letter.  The letter was not returned as undeliverable.  

The Veteran did not reply.  

In the October 2023 decision letter, also mailed to the Veteran at the new address, the RO advised the Veteran that A. had been removed from his award effective January 1, 2014.  That action resulted in an overpayment of $9,369.00, of which the Veteran was notified later that month.  Neither letter was returned as undeliverable.  

As set forth above, the Veteran has appealed the decision.  In his March 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated that the basis for his disagreement was that he and A. had divorced on May 8, 2017.   The address he listed on his form was different than either of the previous two addresses.  The return address on the envelope listed yet another address, also different than either of the previous two addresses.  

The Board notes at this juncture that a Veteran has an obligation to keep VA apprised of his or her whereabouts.  If they do not do so, then there is no burden on the part of VA to "turn up heaven and earth to find [them]."  See Hyson v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 262, 265 (1993); see also Thompson v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 169, 175 (1995) (finding VA may rely on the "last known address" shown of record and burden is on appellant to keep VA apprised of his or her whereabouts).  In other words, ultimately it is the Veteran's responsibility to provide VA with his current contact information of record and comply with any requests for information.  

During the course of the dependency adjustment, however, the RO sent correspondence to various addresses and there is no indication in the file if this was the result of the Veteran's updating VA of an address change or the RO's discovery of a different address.  Given the various addresses used by the RO in this case, and affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the presumption of regularity in the mailing of the April 2022 due process letter has been rebutted.  Cf. Boyd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 63, 71-72 (2014).  

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802, the Board may remand for correction of any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  In this case, the potential failure to provide the necessary due process prior to the retroactive termination is an error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty requiring remand.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the Veteran due process by remailing the April 2022 and August 2022 letters to his current address of record and provide the required time to respond.
