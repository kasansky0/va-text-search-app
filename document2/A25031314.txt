ORDER

Entitlement to a 30 percent disability rating, but not higher, from July 5, 2023, for the service-connected dyspepsia (claimed as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. After resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, from July 5, 2023, the nature, frequency, and severity of symptoms of the Veteran's service-connected dyspepsia (claimed as GERD), including heartburn with acid reflux, regurgitation of stomach contents into throat, feeling of lump in throat, upper abdominal pain, sleep disturbance, chest pain, burning in chest, belching, and gas, are productive of considerable impairment of health.

2. The evidence of record is persuasively against the finding that at any time during the appeal period the Veteran's service-connected dyspepsia manifested by symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss, and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health; stricture, spasm and motility disorder, or acquired diverticulum of esophagus; Barrett's esophagus; adhesions of peritoneum; upper gastrointestinal surgery; gastric, duodenal, gastrojejunal, or peptic ulcers; hypertrophic or chronic gastritis; postgastrectomy syndromes; stenosis of stomach; injury of stomach; irritable colon or irritable bowel syndrome; ulcerative colitis; chronic enteritis; chronic enterocolitis or Crohn's disease or undifferentiated form of inflammatory bowel disease; diverticulitis and diverticulosis; impairment of sphincter control of rectum and anus; stricture of rectum and anus; or prolapse of rectum.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a 30 percent disability rating, but not higher, from July 5, 2023, for the service-connected dyspepsia (claimed as GERD) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110, 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, 4.1, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.14, 4.20, 4.27, 4.112, 4.113, 4.114, Diagnostic code 7203-07, 7301, 7303-10; 7319, 7323, 7325-27, 7332-34, 7346.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army/Army National Guard from March 2004 to August 2004, October 2004 to January 2006, January 2010 to April 2010, and March 2011 to July 2011 with additional Reserve service.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 RO decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to a 30 percent disability rating, but not higher, from July 5, 2023, for the service-connected dyspepsia (claimed as GERD) is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for the service-connected dyspepsia (claimed as GERD). In a September 2024 correspondence, the Veteran's representative argued that the Veteran is entitled to a 30 percent disability rating for the service-connected dyspepsia (claimed as GERD) from July 5, 2023, when he filed the claim for increased rating.

The Board notes that in a December 2017 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for dyspepsia (claimed as GERD) and assigned a 10 percent disability rating from October 18, 2016. The Veteran did not appeal this rating decision, which became final. Subsequently, the Veteran filed the increased rating claim on July 5, 2023. The RO adjudicated the Veteran's increased rating claim, and in the October 2023 rating decision, the RO continued a 10 percent disability rating for the service-connected dyspepsia. The Veteran timely appealed the matter to the Board.

Initially, the Board finds that the applicable rating period on appeal for the service-connected dyspepsia (claimed as GERD) begins from July 5, 2022, one year prior to the receipt of the increased rating claim, if it is factually ascertainable that the increase in disability occurred on that date; otherwise, it is the date of receipt of increased rating claim, which is July 5, 2023. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Where evidence demonstrates a factually ascertainable increase in disability during the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation, the law provides that the effective date of the award "shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Therefore, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of a case: (1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)); (2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable), otherwise; (3) date of receipt of claim. See Harper, 10 Vet. App. at 126; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Thus, the appeal period begins from July 5, 2022, one year prior to the receipt of the increased rating claim for the service-connected dyspepsia, if it is factually ascertainable that the increase in disability occurred on that date; otherwise, it is the date of receipt of increased rating claim, which is July 5, 2023. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Thus, the question for the Board is whether the Veteran is entitled to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for the service-connected dyspepsia (claimed as GERD). After resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that a 30 percent disability rating, but not higher, from July 5, 2023, for the service-connected dyspepsia (claimed as GERD) is warranted based on the following reasons.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of a service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of a disability is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3. 

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when assigning disability rating. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991); 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The Board will consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the period of claim on appeal. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-510 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

The Veteran's service-connected dyspepsia is rated as 10 percent disabling from October 18, 2016, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7399-7346 Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires the use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating assigned; additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Here, the use of diagnostic code 7399-7346 reflects that there is no diagnostic code specifically for dyspepsia, and that the disability has been rated by analogy to hiatal hernia under diagnostic code 7346. The disability is rated by analogy under a diagnostic code for a closely related disability that affects the same anatomical functions and has closely analogous symptomatology. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4.27. Thus, diagnostic code 7399 is a general reference to the rating criteria for disabilities of the digestive system, and diagnostic code 7346 rates hiatal hernia. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7399-7346.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.113, certain diseases of the digestive system, "particularly within the abdomen, which, while differing in the site of pathology, produce a common disability picture characterized in the main by varying degrees of abdominal distress or pain, anemia, and disturbances in nutrition." 38 C.F.R. § 4.113. Consequently, certain coexisting diseases in this area "do not lend themselves to distinct and separate disability evaluations without violating the fundamental principle relating to pyramiding as outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 4.14." Id.

When disabilities have duplicative or overlapping symptoms, the rule against pyramiding prohibits VA from compensating the Veteran more than once for the same symptom or impairment. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

The Board notes that recently, the evaluation criteria for digestive disabilities were amended effective May 19, 2024. Schedule for Rating Disabilities: The Digestive System, 89 Fed. Reg. 19735, 19743, 19754 (Mar. 20, 2024). Because these amendments were not made retroactive, the Board can consider the pre-amended criteria for the entire period, but the amended criteria only as of May 19, 2024. Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

Prior to May 19, 2024, in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, ratings under diagnostic codes 7301 to 7329, inclusive, 7331, 7342, and 7345 to 7348 inclusive will not be combined with each other. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 (2023). A single evaluation will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation. Id.

From May 19, 2024, 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 instructs to not combine ratings under diagnostic codes 7301 through 7329 inclusive, 7331, 7342, 7345 through 7350 inclusive, 7352, and 7355 through 7357 inclusive, with each other. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 (2024). Instead, when more than one rating is warranted under those diagnostic codes, a single evaluation should be assigned under the diagnostic code that reflects the predominant disability picture, and should elevate it to the next higher evaluation if warranted by the severity of the overall disability.

To determine the predominant disability, the evaluator should determine the evaluation each condition would support on its own. The condition that has the highest disability rating is the predominant disability.

As noted above, the Veteran's service-connected dyspepsia is rated under diagnostic code 7346. The Board notes that the May 2024 amendments changed the name of diagnostic code 7346 from "Hernia hiatal" to "Hiatal hernia and paraesophageal hernia," and directs to rate this as stricture of esophagus under diagnostic code 7203. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346 (2024)

Prior to May 19, 2024, under diagnostic code 7346, a 10 percent rating is warranted if the claimant experiences two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent rating of less severity. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346 (2023). A 30 percent rating is warranted for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), pyrosis (heartburn), and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. Id. A 60 percent rating is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis (vomiting of blood) or melena (black, tarry feces associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage) with moderate anemia (a decreased number of red blood cells); or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. Id.

The rating criteria does not define the terms "considerable" or "severe." Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are equitable and just. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. 

The Board is obligated to support its decision with a statement of reasons and bases adequate to enable the Veteran to understand the precise basis for the decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(d)(1); Allday v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 517, 527 (1995). Therefore, it is appropriate to turn to a general-purpose dictionary definition of these terms. See Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (in the absence of an express definition, words are given their ordinary meaning).

The term "considerable" is defined by the dictionary as "large in extent or degree," and "severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267, 1140 (11th ed. 2012).

In assigning a rating under diagnostic 7346, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). The rating criteria are not successive or cumulative with that of the lower rating. See Tatum v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 152, 155 (2009); see also Stankevich v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 470, 472 (2006) (The Court recognized that disabilities rated by analogy will not show all objective criteria of the analogous rating).

As noted above, starting from May 19, 2024, the diagnostic code 7346 directs to rate hiatal hernia and paraesophageal hernia under diagnostic code 7203 that rates stricture of esophagus. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7203, 7346 (2024). From May 19, 2024, under diagnostic code 7203, a zero percent rating is warranted for documented history of stricture of esophagus without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7203 (2024). A 10 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic. Id. A 30 percent rating is warranted for documented history of recurrent esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year. Id. A 50 percent rating is warranted for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement. Id. A maximum of 80 percent rating is warranted for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube). Id.

For purposes of evaluating conditions in 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, the term "substantial weight loss" means a loss of greater than 20 percent of the individual's baseline weight, sustained for three months or longer; and the term "minor weight loss" means a weight loss of 10 to 20 percent of the individual's baseline weight, sustained for three months or longer. 38 C.F.R. § 4.112. The term "inability to gain weight" means that there has been substantial weight loss with inability to regain it despite appropriate therapy. Id. "Baseline weight" means the average weight for the two-year-period preceding onset of the disease. Id. 

The Board has reviewed the relevant evidence of record from beginning of the rating period on appeal to analyze the level of severity of the Veteran's service-connected dyspepsia.

In a July 2023 statement in support of claim, the Veteran stated that he had symptoms of heartburn with acid reflux, regurgitation of stomach contents into throat, feeling of lump in throat, upper abdominal pain monthly, belching, and gas. He also stated that regurgitation was worse on sleeping, with certain food, eating large amounts, or eating fast. He also stated that he gets chest pain with acid reflux flare-ups. He reported new symptom of burning sensation in chest. He reported sleeping difficulty at night due to acid reflux, due to which he has daytime fatigue, mood changes, irritability, frequent yawning, and difficulty enjoying social events and interactions.

In July 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for esophageal conditions (including GERD, hiatal hernia and other esophageal disorders). In the July 2023 VA examination report, the examiner noted the diagnosis of dyspepsia (claimed as GERD). As a medical history, the examiner noted the Veteran's reports of onset of his dyspepsia disability in 2006 with intermittent reflux with late night meals preceding sleep. The Veteran reported that his symptoms progressively worsened. He reported symptoms due to acidic meals, large meals, or fast eating. The examiner noted no history of EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy). As current symptoms, the Veteran reported heartburn and reflux. The examiner noted no reported symptoms of dysphagia, odynophagia, sleep disturbances, weight changes, hematemesis, or melena. The examiner did not note use of continuous medication for the Veteran's dyspepsia.

As signs and symptoms of dyspepsia, the examiner noted the symptoms of pyrosis (heartburn) and reflux. The examiner did not note sleep disturbance cause by esophageal reflux, material weight loss, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, or melena with moderate anemia. Also, the examiner did not note that the symptoms of the Veteran's esophageal condition are productive of considerable impairment of health, or productive of severe impairment of health.

The examiner also noted that the Veteran does not have esophageal stricture, spasm of esophagus (cardiospasm or achalasia), or an acquired diverticulum of the esophagus. No tumors or neoplasms were noted. The examiner noted that no diagnostic testing or laboratory testing was performed. Finally, the examiner did not note any functional impact of the Veteran's esophageal condition. 

In the September 2024 correspondence, the Veteran's representative argued that a 30 percent disability rating is warranted from July 5, 2023, for the Veteran's dyspepsia based on the Veteran's reported symptoms in the July 2023 statement because these symptoms are productive of considerable impairment of health.

After resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the nature, frequency, and severity of symptoms of the Veteran's service-connected dyspepsia (claimed as GERD), including heartburn with acid reflux, regurgitation of stomach contents into throat, feeling of lump in throat, upper abdominal pain, sleep disturbance, chest pain, burning in chest, belching, and gas, are productive of considerable impairment of health, which warrants a 30 percent disability rating under diagnostic code 7346 effective prior to May 19, 2024. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346 (2023).

The Veteran does not have all the symptoms listed in the 30 percent rating criteria, but he has substernal pain (chest pain), pyrosis (heartburn), and regurgitation that are listed in the 30 percent rating criteria. Furthermore, he has additional symptoms of feeling of a lump in throat, upper abdominal pain, sleep disturbance, burning in chest, belching, and gas. As noted above, in Stankevich, the Court recognized that disabilities rated by analogy will not show all objective criteria of the analogous rating. 19 Vet. App. at 472.

As far as impact of the above noted symptoms on the Veteran's health is concerned, the Board notes that the Veteran has reported that he has sleep impairment due to acid reflux at night, chest pain with acid reflux flare-ups, and burning sensation in chest. He also has daytime fatigue, mood changes, irritability, frequent yawning, and difficulty enjoying social events and interactions due to lack of sleep due to acid reflux at night. Thus, the Board finds that these symptoms are productive of considerable impairment of health, which warrants a 30 percent rating under diagnostic code 7346 effective prior to May 19, 2024. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346 (2023). 

As noted above, starting from May 19, 2024, the diagnostic code 7346 directs to rate hiatal hernia and paraesophageal hernia under diagnostic code 7203 that rates stricture of esophagus. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7203, 7346 (2024). As noted above, from May 19, 2024, under diagnostic code 7203, a 30 percent rating is warranted for documented history of recurrent esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year. Id. However, in this case, there is no evidence of record that shows that the Veteran has or had recurrent esophageal stricture(s) during the rating period on appeal. Thus, the Board finds that the pre-amended diagnostic code 7346 is more favorable to the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346 (2023). As noted above, the Board can consider the pre-amended criteria for the entire period, but the amended criteria only as of May 19, 2024. Kuzma, 341 F.3d 1327. Therefore, the Board will utilize the pre-amended diagnostic code 7346 in this case, under which a 30 percent disability rating is warranted from July 5, 2023, the date of receipt of increased rating claim. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346 (2023).

Furthermore, there is no factually ascertainable increase in the service-connected disability of dyspepsia during the one-year period preceding the filing of the increased rating claim on July 5, 2023. Thus, the correct date of assignment of the increased rating of 30 percent is July 5, 2023, the date of receipt of increased rating claim.

However, a disability rating in excess of 30 percent under pre-amended diagnostic code 7346 is not warranted because the evidence of record does not show symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346 (2023). As noted above, "severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful." The Veteran has asserted that he has chest pain during the flare-ups of acid reflux. However, the evidence of record does not reflect that the Veteran has vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

Additionally, in the September 2024 correspondence, the Veteran's representative argued that a 30 percent rating is warranted from July 5, 2023, based on the Veteran's reported symptoms in the July 2023 statement because these symptoms are productive of a considerable impairment of health. However, the representative did not allege that the symptoms of the Veteran's dyspepsia are productive of severe impairment of health.

The Board notes that the assignment of a particular diagnostic code is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case." See Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993). One diagnostic code may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, the diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology. Therefore, the Board has considered other potential diagnostic codes that rate gastroesophageal conditions. 

The Board notes that the May 2024 amendments added a new diagnostic code 7206 specifically for GERD. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7206 (2024). Under diagnostic code 7206, a zero percent rating is warranted for documented history of GERD without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications. Id. A 10 percent rating is warranted for documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic. Id. A 30 percent rating is warranted for documented history of recurrent esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year. Id. A 50 percent rating is warranted for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement. Id. An 80 percent rating is warranted for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction of esophageal stricture(s) or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube). Id.

Since the Veteran does not have a documented history of recurrent esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year, a separate rating or a rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's service-connected dyspepsia is not warranted under diagnostic code 7206. 38 C.F.R. §§ 34.114, Diagnostic Code 7206 (2024).

The Board has considered other diagnostic codes besides diagnostic codes 7206 and 7346 that rate gastroesophageal conditions. The Board notes that stricture of esophagus is rated under diagnostic code 7203; spasms of (cardiospasm) of esophagus or esophageal motility disorder is rated under diagnostic code 7204; acquired diverticulum of esophagus is rated under diagnostic code 7205; Barrett's esophagus is rated under diagnostic code 7207; adhesion of peritoneum is rated under diagnostic code 7301; chronic complications of upper gastrointestinal surgery is rated under diagnostic code 7303; gastric ulcer or peptic ulcer disease is rated under diagnostic code 7304; prior to the May 2024 amendments, duodenal ulcer was rated under diagnostic code 7305, and marginal (gastrojejunal) ulcer was rated under diagnostic code 7306; hypertrophic gastritis (identified by gastroscope), or chronic gastritis is rated under diagnostic code 7307; postgastrectomy syndrome is rated under diagnostic code 7308: stenosis of stomach is rated under diagnostic code 7309; residuals of injury of stomach is rated under diagnostic code 7310; irritably colon syndrome or irritable bowel syndrome is rated under diagnostic code 7319; ulcerative colitis is rated under diagnostic code 7323; chronic enteritis is rated under diagnostic code 7325; chronic enterocolitis or Crohn's disease or undifferentiated form of inflammatory bowel disease is rated under diagnostic code 7326; diverticulitis and diverticulosis are rated under diagnostic code 7327; impairment of sphincter control of rectum and anus is rated under diagnostic code 7332; stricture of rectum and anus is rated under diagnostic code 7333; and prolapse of rectum is rated under diagnostic code 7334. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7203-05, 7207, 7301, 7303-10; 7319, 7323, 7325-27, 7332-34.

The evidence of record is persuasively against finding that at any time during the appeal period the Veteran's service-connected dyspepsia manifested by stricture, spasm and motility disorder, or acquired diverticulum of esophagus; Barrett's esophagus; adhesions of peritoneum; upper gastrointestinal surgery; gastric, duodenal, gastrojejunal, or peptic ulcers; hypertrophic or chronic gastritis; postgastrectomy syndromes; stenosis of stomach; injury of stomach; irritable colon or irritable bowel syndrome; ulcerative colitis; chronic enteritis; chronic enterocolitis or Crohn's disease or undifferentiated form of inflammatory bowel disease; diverticulitis; impairment of sphincter control of rectum and anus; stricture of rectum and anus; or prolapse of rectum. Therefore, separate rating or a rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted under any of these diagnostic codes 7203-05, 7207, 7301, 7303-10; 7319, 7323, 7325-27, 7332-34.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms of gastrointestinal conditions. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). As noted above, the Veteran has reported the symptoms of heartburn with acid reflux, regurgitation of stomach contents into throat, feeling of lump in throat, upper abdominal pain, sleep disturbance, chest pain, burning in chest, belching, and gas. The Board has considered these symptoms, and finds that these symptoms are productive of considerable impairment of health. Therefore, the Board is granting a 30 percent disability rating for dyspepsia. However, the evidence of record persuasively against the finding that Veteran has symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss, and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. Therefore, a disability rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted.

Since the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the disability rating in excess of 30 percent for the service-connected dyspepsia, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

Accordingly, entitlement to a 30 percent disability rating, but not higher, from July 5, 2023, for the service-connected dyspepsia (claimed as GERD) is granted.
