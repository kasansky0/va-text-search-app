REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from August 1964 to August 1967.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 higher-level review (HLR) decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In August 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on November 19, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

While the Board regrets the delay, a remand is necessary to correct pre-decisional duty-to-assist errors. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Specifically, VA erred by failing to: (1) associate VA treatment records with the Veteran's claims file; and (2) obtaining an adequate opinion as to the Veteran's claimed bilateral hearing loss. 

A review of the Veteran's VA treatment records reveals that the Veteran has undergone audiometric evaluations in June 2010, March 2018, and February 2020. See December 2018 and February 2024 VA treatment records. Though it appears that the results of the evaluation have been scanned into a VA database for at least the June 2010 and March 2018 evaluations, the records have not been associated with the Veteran's claims file. As such, upon remand, VA should associate the Veteran's VA treatment records, including the results of his audiometric evaluations held in VA databases, with his claims file. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(c)(1)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(3).

In addition, VA obtained an examination for the Veteran's claimed bilateral hearing loss in March 2024; however, the opinion was not supported by sufficient rationale to adjudicate the claim. The examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner reasoned that "[a]lthough noise exposure is conceded with military service it is not evidence of HL. The STR is negative for HL at the time of separation which is objective evidence of no HL resulting from active service activity." Here, it appears the examiner's opinion is improperly based on the absence of a diagnosed disability in service. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993). The absence of in-service evidence of a diagnosed disability is not fatal to a claim for service connection. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). Moreover, the Veteran has asserted that his service treatment records show a significant threshold shift. See April 2024 correspondence. Upon review of the Veteran's service treatment records, it appears there was a positive threshold shift in at least some of the frequencies tested from the time of the Veteran's enlistment and separation from service, such as a shift from -5 to 10 decibels bilaterally at 4000 hertz. See August 1964 and June 1967 reports of medical examination. As the examiner opined that the Veteran did not experience a permanent positive significant threshold shift despite the other relevant evidence showing a positive threshold shift during the Veteran's service, the examiner should have provided a rationale for his conclusion. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) ("Neither a VA medical examination report nor a private medical opinion is entitled to any weight in a service-connection or rating context if it contains only data and conclusions. It is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes probative value to a medical opinion"). As such, upon remand, VA should obtain an opinion as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed bilateral hearing loss that is sufficiently support by the examiner's reasoning in consideration of the relevant evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination or obtain an opinion in connection with a service connection claim, it must provide or obtain one that is adequate for purposes of the determination being made).

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Associate the Veteran's outstanding VA treatment records with his claims file, with specific attention to records of the June 2010, March 2018, and February 2020 audiometric evaluations. Document all searches and associate them with the Veteran's claims file.

2. Once the above is completed, obtain a new medical opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss. If the examiner deems it necessary, schedule the Veteran for an examination and/or additional testing. A copy of the Veteran's claims file, to include the above records as well as this REMAND, should be made available to and reviewed by the examiner.

The examiner should then opine as to whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) caused by or otherwise the result of his service.

The examiner is directed to address the Veteran's assertion that his service treatment records demonstrate a significant threshold shift between the time of his enlistment and separation from service. See August 1964 report of medical examination for enlistment and June 1967 report of medical examination for separation demonstrating a shift from -5 to 10 decibels bilaterally at 4000 hertz. 

Each opinion expressed by the examiner should be accompanied by a complete rationale. If the examiner is unable to offer an opinion without resorting to speculation, a thorough explanation as to why an opinion cannot be rendered should be provided, including whether it is due to a limitation of general medical knowledge, the examiner's knowledge, or information about the Veteran's medical history.
