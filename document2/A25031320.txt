FINDING OF FACT

1. New evidence was received subsequent to the September 2014 Rating Decision denying service connection for a bilateral knee condition that is relevant to the claims on appeal. 

2. Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the evidence in equipoise as to whether the Veteran suffered a back injury during service, and where symptoms stemming from said injury have continued ever since service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for readjudicating the claims of entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee conditions have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501.

2. The criteria for service connection for a low back condition are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active-duty service from July 22, 1992 to July 21, 1994, and from June 30, 2006 to November 1, 2007.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for hair loss and bilateral knee disabilities, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103©(2)(ii). 

New and Relevant Evidence

1. New and relevant evidence has been received and the claim for service connection for a right knee condition

2. New and relevant evidence has been received, and the claim for service connection for a left knee condition

In general, decisions of a VA regional office (RO) that are not appealed in the prescribed time period are final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103. Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) framework, "a claimant or his or her authorized representative, if any, who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim. If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the agency of original jurisdiction will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record." See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d) and 3.2501.

New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim. Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).

The Board finds that new and relevant evidence is now associated with the Veteran's claims file, and therefore readjudicating the claims for service connection for bilateral knee conditions is warranted. Specifically, upon review of the Veteran's VA treatment records, the Board finds he now has a diagnosis of bilateral knee arthritis and requires the use of braces due to increased functional limitation. See June 2021, VA treatment record; September 2022, VA treatment record. Said findings are new evidence and relevant to the element of a currently diagnosed disability, of which had not been previously established at the time of the September 2014 denial for service connection. Accordingly, the claims will be readjudicated.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a low back condition

Initially, the Board notes favorable findings made by the RO, specifically that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of low back sprain, and that he incurred a back injury during service. See January 2024 Rating Decision. Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim meets the first two elements of service connection. Accordingly, the Board's analysis turns to that of nexus, specifically as to whether there exists a medical connection between the Veteran's currently diagnosed lumbosacral strain and in-service injury.  

For the last element of Shedden, the Veteran must show a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Here, the Veteran was afforded a January 2022 VA examination, of which diagnosed him with a lumbosacral sprain. However, the VA examiner did not address as to whether the Veteran's condition directly relates to service in noting that it was not caused by the geography of the Veteran's service. Id. The Board finds said opinion to be inadequate as no rationale was provided. Rather, the Board finds the Veteran's VA treatment records to be most probative of record indicating that the Veteran suffers from chronic back pain. See, e.g., December 2023 VA treatment record (noting chronic multi-joint pain); September 2022 VA treatment record (chronic back pain). Additionally, the Veteran's service treatment records indicate that during service the Veteran suffered chronic back pain then as well. See, e.g., April 13, 1997, STR. As such, the Board finds that doubt should be resolved in the Veteran's favor on the issue of nexus warranting a grant of service connection for a currently diagnosed lumbosacral strain, and the claim is granted. See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to service connection for hair loss is remanded.

Upon review of the record, the Veteran was scheduled for VA examinations assessing the nature and etiology of his claimed conditions. The Veteran did not report. However, the Veteran did inform VA that he was not able to report on time due to rush hour traffic of which caused him to be late and therefore could not be seen. See January 2024 Report of General Information. The Veteran thus put forth argument that as good cause has been shown the examinations ought to be rescheduled, and the Board agrees. See March 2024 Appellate Brief. Accordingly, the Board will remand to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error prior to adjudicating the claims on appeal. 

3. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition is remanded.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition is remanded.

As previously noted, the record now reveals a new diagnosis of bilateral knee arthritis, as well as the need for use of braces due to functional impairment. See June 11, 2021, VA treatment record; September 2022 VA treatment record. The record also reveals that the Veteran was previously scheduled for a VA examination to assess that nature and etiology of his claimed for bilateral knee condition. Given that the Veteran has provided good cause relative to the recent examination request for claims previously, the Board will similarly afford the Veteran another attempt as new and relevant evidence is now of record in order to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error. However, the Veteran is reminded that the duty to assist is a two-way street, therefore, he is obligated to cooperate with the VA examiner's efforts to evaluate the nature and etiology of his claimed for right knee conditions. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for new VA examinations to assess the nature and etiologies of his claimed for conditions. Upon review of the record, to include this remand and as indicated below, the VA examiner is requested to opine as to the following:

Hair Loss...

Is it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's claimed for hair loss condition incurred during service or otherwise directly relates to service?

In opining, the VA examiner is requested to address the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA). See VBMS, document titled "other," receipt dated June 29, 2023 (noting Persian Gulf War Service). 

Bilateral Knees...

Is it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's claimed for bilateral knee conditions incurred during service or otherwise directly relate to service?

In opining, the VA examiner is requested to address the Veteran's theory of entitlement that his currently diagnosed bilateral knee condition was caused by his in-service military duties and activities as a combat infantryman, or rather as due to his conceded Persian Gulf War Service. See VBMS, document titled "DD 214 Certified Original - Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty," receipt dated June 17, 2015 (noting infantryman as the Veteran's primary specialty); document titled "other," receipt dated June 29, 2023 (indicating the Veteran's participation in a TERA relative to his Persian Gulf War Service). 	

The VA examiner is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions reached. The VA examiner is reminded that the term "as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility," but rather that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher. 

Note that the lack of documented treatment in service or for a period after is not an adequate reason on its own for a negative opinion.  The Veteran's lay statements must also be considered.
