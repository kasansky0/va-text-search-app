REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for kidney disease is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from December 1999 to October 2003.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sincerely thanks the Veteran for his honorable service to our country.

This case comes before the Board on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for kidney disease, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Veteran seeks service connection for kidney disease.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See, e.g., Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Pursuant to the AMA, the Board is bound by previous findings of fact that are favorable to the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801.  Here, the AOJ has found and conceded both that the Veteran is currently diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and that the Veteran's February 2000 service treatment records show that the Veteran was treated for a kidney infection.  See August 2024 Rating Decision.  Here the Board notes that the Veteran's service treatment records also show that he was treated for a urinary tract infection.  See February 2000 Service Treatment Records.

Therefore, the only question before the Board is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's current kidney disease and his in-service kidney and urinary tracts infections.

The Veteran has received a VA examination for kidney disease.  The examiner confirmed that the Veteran is diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, vesicoureteral reflex but opined that this condition is less likely than not caused by the Veteran's service.  See July 2023 VA Examination.  As rationale, the examiner stated "There was no information in STR to indicate that the Veteran developed a chronic kidney condition during service.  A nexus for service connection cannot be made at this time due to the missing elements of origin and chronicity."  Id.  The examiner provided no other rationale or explanation. 

An opinion based on the absence of a disability in service, as this one, is inadequate and therefore a new opinion is needed.  See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993).

Once VA has provided a VA examination, it is required to provide an adequate one, regardless of whether it was legally obligated to provide an examination in the first place.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  A medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.  See Nieves- Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).

Again, it is not in dispute that the Veteran was treated for a kidney infection and a urinary tract infection during service.  The Veteran has specifically contended that he received insufficient treatment for his urinary tract infection, and this insufficient treatment at least contributed to his later development of kidney disease.  See e.g. June 2023 Correspondence.  The Veteran has also submitted medical literature regarding the link between urinary tract infections and kidney disease.  See June 2023 Correspondence. 

The VA examiner does not appear to have addressed these contentions at all.  It is plausible that the Veteran's urinary tract infection and kidney infection during service at least contributed to his later development of kidney disease, but the Board cannot make that medical determination in the first instance.

The Board may only remand for correction of a pre-decisional duty to assist error on the part of the AOJ, or for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  This claim is remanded to correct a pre-decisional error in VA's duty to assist.  

A remand is required to afford the Veteran an adequate VA medical examination.  The VA has a duty to assist Veterans by providing adequate medical exams.  Reliance by the AOJ on an inadequate medical exam to deny benefits is an example of a pre-decisional duty to assist error that must be corrected.  A new examination and opinion-based on full review of the record and supported by stated rationale-is needed to fairly resolve the issues on appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (2018).

The Board sincerely regrets additional delay, but the Board cannot escape the conclusion that any further adjudication of this claim is precluded as a matter of law.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriately qualified medical professional to determine the nature and etiology of his kidney disease.  The examiner must review the Veteran's claims file, including this BVA Remand Decision.  The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

(a.) Is the Veteran's kidney disease as least as likely as not directly related to his service, to include the Veteran's kidney and urinary tract infections during service?

i.	The examiner is to take note that the Veteran is already diagnosed with kidney disease and that the Veteran was treated for a kidney infection and a urinary tract infection while active duty.  These are conceded favorable findings on the Veteran's behalf.  

In providing the opinion, the examiner should consider and discuss any lay statements of record, to include the Veteran's statements regarding the onset and persistence of his symptoms.  

A complete rationale must be provided for each opinion expressed.  In this regard, a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved would be of considerable assistance to the Board.  Further, the examiner must review this remand decision and avoid the inadequate rationale relied on by the prior examiners.
