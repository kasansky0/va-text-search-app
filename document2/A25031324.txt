ORDER

The appeal of the deferred issue of entitlement to compensation for a low back disability is dismissed.   

REMANDED

Entitlement to an increased rating greater than 10 percent for lumbosacral strain (claimed as low back condition) prior to December 16, 2024, and greater than 20 percent thereafter is remanded.  

FINDING OF FACT

The rating decision dated December 4, 2023, deferred making a final decision on the issue of entitlement to service connection for a low back disability.  Service connection for a low back disability was granted in a January 2024 rating decision.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for service connection for a low back disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2011 to October 2015.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from December 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to an increased rating for lumbosacral strain, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Dismissal of the deferred decision for compensation for a low back disability

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran listed the issue of "entitlement to compensation for a low back disability is deferred" in the December 2023 rating decision.  In the December 2023 rating decision, the RO deferred a decision on compensation for a low back disability for further development.  It did not decide  entitlement to compensation for that disability.  Accordingly, the December 2023 rating decision did not constitute an adjudicative determination from which an NOD may be filed.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.201; Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458 (2011) (concluding that a deferred rating decision does not constitute an appealable adjudicative action). Therefore, the issue of a deferred determination for compensation for a low back disability is not before the Board.  Further, the grant of service connection for a low back disability in January 2024 was a full grant of the benefit sought.  There remains no case or controversy before the Board as to the claim for service connection for a low back disability. Consequently, the Board has no jurisdiction to review that issue, and the appeal of a deferred decision regarding service connection for a low back disability must be dismissed.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an increased rating for lumbosacral strain greater than 10 percent prior to December 16, 2024 and greater than 20 percent thereafter is remanded.  

A review of the record reveals the Veteran reported taking medication for his lumbar spine disability, with the September 2023 examiner noting treatment with lidocaine patches and ibuprofen.  

As DC 5237 does not contemplate the effects of pain medication in its rating criteria, the Board's reliance on the current medical evidence of record would improperly consider the effects of medication.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012) (holding that, when assigning a disability rating, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria).  In Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, the Court held that Jones applies to the review of ratings of musculoskeletal disabilities. 

Thus, the Board finds that determining the ameliorative effects of such medication is necessary to adequately assess the severity of the Veteran's lumbar spine.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from the September 2023 lumbar spine examiner or another appropriate examiner.  The examiner must provide a medical opinion identifying whether any medications the Veteran used during the appeal period affected the severity of his lumbar spine disability.

If so, identify each medication and clearly explain how such medication affected the condition.

If any such medication is productive of ameliorative effects, clearly identify such effects and opine as to the severity of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability absent such medication.  To the extent possible, such severity should be expressed in terms of range of motion (ROM).

In addressing the ameliorative effects of medication(s), the examiner is instructed to specifically address whether, absent such medication, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability would have manifested with ankylosis or the functional equivalence thereof, to include during flare-ups or following repeated use over time.

A detailed rationale for the opinion would be of considerable assistance to the Board.  If an opinion cannot be provided, the examiner should explain why it is not possible to provide an opinion.
