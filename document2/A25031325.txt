FINDING OF FACT

On March 3, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision, the Veteran withdrew the present appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2004 to January 2006 and from November 2020 to March 2022.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2022 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) rating decisions. 

In the August 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Dismissed Appeals

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. 

In the March 3, 2025, statement, he indicated he would like to withdraw the appeal because he is already in receipt of a 100 percent rating.  The Board finds that the Veteran's withdrawal of the issues on appeal is "explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action on the part of the claimant." DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011); see also Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2018). 

Therefore, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration with regard to this particular appeal.  Accordingly, the issues are dismissed.
