ORDER

Service connection for cause of the Veteran's death is granted.

Entitlement to Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran died in November 2017 and, according to his death certificate, the Veteran's immediate cause of death was hypoxic brain injury, cardiac arrest and a perforated duodenal ulcer. 

2. At the time of the Veteran's death, service connection was in effect for the residuals of his through and through wound of the abdomen, injury MG XIX, moderate, which was evaluated as 30 percent disabling, effective February 20, 2014.

3. The evidence of record is at least in approximate balance regarding whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities substantially or materially contributed to cause the Veteran's death.

4. The award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death renders moot the claim for entitlement to DIC benefits under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1318.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for the Veteran's cause of death have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1116, 1310, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.312.

2. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1971 to April 1972, including service in the Republic of Vietnam from August 1971 to April 1972.  The Veteran unfortunately died in November 2017.  The Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant indicated she disagreed with a May 2024 rating decision and elected the Direct Review docket.

As an appeal in which the appellant requested, on the Notice of Disagreement, Direct review by the Board without submission of additional evidence and without a Board hearing, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the decision on the issues on appeal.  38 C.F.R. 20.301. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Service connection for cause of death

Service treatment records show that, while serving in Vietnam the Veteran sustained a gunshot wound to his abdomen.

In a September 1972 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for residuals of a through and through wound to the abdomen; wound entrance in the anterior abdomen; wound of exit in back; resection of part of bowel.  The RO assigned a single, initial 100 percent rating for the disability, effective April 14, 1972.

In a July 1973 rating decision, the RO reduced the rating to a combined 30 percent evaluation, with 10 percent each for residuals of a through and through wound of the abdomen with injury to Muscle Group XIX, moderate, under Diagnostic Code 5319; a 10 percent rating for a wound of the spinal muscles, injury to Muscle Group XX, moderate, under Diagnostic Code 5320, and a 10 percent rating for peritoneal adhesions under Diagnostic Code 7301.  The 10 percent ratings were each effective October 1, 1973.

In an August 2014 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for tinnitus and assigned an evaluation of 10 percent, effective February 20, 2014, increased the evaluation of his through and through wound of the abdomen, injury MG XIX, moderate, from 10 percent to 30 percent effective February 20, 2014; and increased the evaluation of his wound of spinal muscles, injury MG XX, moderate, from 10 percent to 20 percent, effective February 20, 2014.

The combined disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities was 60 percent, effective February 20, 2014.

Service connection may be granted for the cause of a Veteran's death if a disorder incurred in or aggravated by service either caused or contributed substantially or materially to the cause of death.  To establish service connection for the cause of a Veteran's death, competent evidence must link the fatal disease to a period of military service or an already service-connected disability.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1310; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.312; Ruiz v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 352 (1997).

The evidence must show that the disability incurred in or aggravated by active service was the principal or contributory cause of death.  In order to constitute the principal cause of death, the service-connected disability must be one of the immediate or underlying causes of death or be etiologically related to the cause of death.  Contributory cause of death is inherently one not related to the principal cause.  To constitute the contributory cause of death it must be shown that the service-connected disability contributed substantially or materially; that it combined to cause death; that it aided or lent assistance to the production of death.  It is not sufficient to show that it casually shared in producing death, but rather it must be shown that there was a causal connection.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.312; Lathan v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 359 (1995); Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39 (1994).

According to his death certificate, the Veteran's immediate cause of death was hypoxic brain injury, cardiac arrest and a perforated duodenal ulcer.  Significant contributors to death were acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and morbid obesity.  

There is no VA medical opinion addressing whether the Veteran's cause of death was due to a service-connected disability.

As noted above, as a result of an in-service gunshot wound to the abdomen, service connection was in effect for residuals of a through and through wound of the abdomen injury MG XIX, moderate, wound of the spinal muscles, injury MG XX, moderate and peritoneal adhesions. 

One of the conditions listed as contributing to his hypoxic brain injury was a perforated doudenal ulcer.  

Here, in its role as a finder of fact, the Board concludes that the Veteran's service-connected conditions of through and through wound of the abdomen injury MG XIX, moderate, wound of the spinal muscles, injury MG XX, moderate and peritoneal adhesions, cannot be disassociated from the Veteran's cause of death.

Based on the foregoing, the Board cannot find that the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim.  Thus, this is a case in which to the grant the Appellant the benefit of the doubt.  

Accordingly, with resolution of all reasonable doubt in the Appellant's favor, the Board concludes that service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990)

2. Entitlement to DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318

The Appellant has submitted a claim based on 38 U.S.C. § 1318, as an alternative theory of entitlement to the service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.

In light of the grant of benefits described above, the Board concludes that the appellant's 1318 claim is rendered moot.  Indeed, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 2307, there are service-connected death burial benefits that are available under 38 U.S.C. § 1310, but not under 38 U.S.C. § 1318.  See Mintz v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 277, 282-83 (1994); see also Moffitt v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 214, 224 (1997).

Entitlement to VA benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 1310 is the greater benefit, and it is granted in full herein.  Therefore, no additional benefit (monetary or otherwise) can be gained under 38 C.F.R. § 1318, nor does any controversy remain.  See Hornick v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 50, 53-57 (2010); Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000).  Further, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has indicated that only if an Appellant's claim for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is denied under 38 U.S.C. § 1310 is VA required to also consider an appellant's claim under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1318.  See Timberlake, 14 Vet. App. at 134-35. 

In light of the grant of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, the respective claim for entitlement to DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 is moot.

Accordingly, this claim is dismissed.
