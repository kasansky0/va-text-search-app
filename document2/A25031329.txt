CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an initial 100 percent rating for a heart condition have been met.  38?U.S.C. §§?1155, 5103;?38?C.F.R. §§?4.3, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7005.

2. For the entire appeal period, the grant of a total (100 percent) rating for the Veteran's service-connected heart condition renders moot the appeal for entitlement to a TDIU.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.16.

3. The criteria for entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) have been met.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from November 1973 to September 1977.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).  The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 for a supplemental claim in June 2023 after the RO awarded service connection for a heart condition and assigned a 60 percent rating from August 10, 2022.  The RO issued a rating decision in September 2023, which continued the Veteran's 60 percent rating.  The Veteran timely appealed the rating decision by submitting a VA Form 10182 and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the Veterans Appeals Improvement Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA).  Under direct review, the Board cannot hold a hearing or accept additional evidence into the record.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301 (2019).  Therefore, the Board will consider the evidence of record as of September 12, 2023, the date of the notification letter of the rating decision on appeal.  Id.

1. Entitlement to an initial 100 percent rating for a heart condition is granted.

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a veteran's present symptomatology with criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for?Rating?Disabilities (Rating?Schedule), which is based on average impairment in earning capacity. 38?U.S.C. §?1155;?38 C.F.R. Part 4.  When a question arises as to which of two ratings?applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher?rating?is assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating.  38?C.F.R. §?4.7.  Otherwise, the lower?rating?will be assigned.? Id.? After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the veteran.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.3. 

The veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability?ratings.  See generally?38?C.F.R. §?4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski,?1?Vet. App.?589?(1995).  Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability?rating?is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown,?7?Vet. App.?55, 58?(1994).? 

Where the appeal arises from the original assignment of a disability evaluation following an award of service connection, as here for coronary artery disease, the severity of the disability at issue is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the?disability rating?to the present time.  See Fenderson v. West,?12?Vet. App. 119?(1999).  

The Veteran's service-connected heart condition has been rated under 38 C.F.R. §?4.104, Diagnostic Codes 7005.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for a cardiovascular disability with a workload of greater than 7 METs but not greater than 10 METs resulting in heart failure symptoms; or continuous medication required for control.  A 30 percent rating contemplates a workload of greater than 5 METs, but not greater than 7 METs resulting in heart failure symptoms; or, evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multigated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging).  A 60 percent rating is warranted for workload of greater than 3 METs, but not greater than 5 METs that results in heart failure symptoms.  A 100 percent rating is assigned for workload of 3 METs or less which results in heart failure symptoms. 

One MET (metabolic equivalent) is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. When the level of METs at which dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope may be used.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.104, Note (2).

The Veteran is currently assigned a 60 rating, and he contends that a higher rating is warranted.  After a review of the record, the Board finds that Veteran's heart condition more nearly approximates the 100 percent rating criteria.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2022.  An interview based METs test was conducted and revealed METs level to be greater than 3 to 5 METs.  This METs level has been found to be consistent with activities such as light yard work (weeding), mowing lawn (power mower), brisk walking (4 mph).  The examiner noted the Veteran experienced breathlessness, fatigue, angina, and dizziness during activity.  The examiner also noted that the Veteran was unable to stand or walk for prolonged distances. 

The Veteran reported in June 2023 that physical exertion led to shortness of breath, angina, and near syncopal episodes.  He nearly passed out while on the job due shortness of breath and angina.  He further reported that, while overseas visiting his wife's family, he could not keep up just shopping.  In one instance, he had to stop for a significant period of time to catch his breath after walking approximately 50 feet and taking only one step.  He also had to stop during his physical therapy for a knee injury because the physical exercise would cause severe chest pain and shortness of breath.  Finally, when engaged in sexual intercourse with his wife, he would cough up foamy blood.  

The Veteran submitted several statements in June 2023 from his friends, people he used to work with, and his wife.  B.S., who was the Veteran's supervisor at work, provided that he witnessed the Veteran struggling at work, becoming short of breath and dizzy.  He worried that the Veteran would injure himself.  On one occasion, they were tasked with moving 5,000 pieces of office equipment and desks from one school building to another, and B.S. assigned the Veteran as a driver instead of having him physically lifting furniture out of concern for his health.  M.S., a friend of the Veteran's, shared that the Veteran used to be able to help with unloading and work around her property.  However, over the years, the Veteran gets short of breath with even minimal exertion and has to stop and rest in a reclining position.  He often had episodes of chest pain, dizziness, and frequent coughing with "bloody foam."  His quality of life has deteriorated over the years since she has known him and he can no longer do the jobs he used to do.  Another friend and previous supervisor of the Veteran's, J.F., provided that he was on an overseas trip with the Veteran and his wife, and he had to leave the Veteran behind on numerous occasions because the Veteran could not keep up.  J.F. stated that he was in his late sixties while his significant other was in her seventies.  On one occasion during Father's Day, the Veteran had to stay behind while others walked the beach.

S.A.O., another friend, stated that the Veteran became short of breath from walking quickly with chest pain and required at least five minutes to recover.  Going up and down one flight of stairs also tired him out.  The Veteran does not have the endurance to do his job in maintenance.  Finally, the Veteran's wife shared that the Veteran has issues with walking 20 to 30 meters and has to catch his breath by standing and stopping and would rest up to 10 minutes.  The Veteran has problems with climbing stairs, and he would wake up in the middle of his sleep to complain about chest pain, which usually happened after an active day. 

The Veteran appeared for another VA examination in August 2023.  An interview based METs test was done and showed METs level to be greater than 3 to 5 METs, with symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, and angina.  The examiner found that the Veteran's METs level was limited to brisk walking, which made him fatigue and short of breath.  His endurance was very low, and it would be difficult for him to perform endurance type activities, manual labor, or ambulation for anything more than short distances.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's heart condition did not impact his ability to work. 

After careful consideration of the evidence, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively in favor of a 100 percent rating for Veteran's heart condition as the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether a workload of 3 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms.  As indicated above, the medical evidence demonstrates that breathlessness, fatigue, angina, and dizziness resulted from a workload of 3 to 5 METs.  However, the lays statements contained evidence that the Veteran not only experiences problems with climbing stairs or manual labor, but he was also unable to walk more than one to two blocks at a slow pace without needing to rest, which is consistent with METs level below 3 for activities such as a slow walk.  The Veteran became short of breath even with minimal exertion and was unable to participate in normal activities at group gatherings such as a walk on the beach.  His wife provided that the Veteran had to stop walking every 20 to 30 meters on flat surfaces.  

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that his heart condition has manifested with METs level of less than 3 for the entire appeal period.  Accordingly, an increased rating to 100 percent is warranted, and the Veteran's claim is granted.  The Board notes that a 100 percent rating is the maximum allowable rating under Diagnostic Code 7005.  

2. Entitlement to a TDIU is dismissed as moot.

As an initial matter, evidence shows that the Veteran may not be capable of any gainful employment due to his heart condition.  See June 2023 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.  Thus, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU has been raised.  See 38 C.F.R. §?4.16;?Rice?v. Shinseki,?22?Vet. App. 447 (2009).  

A TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).  

For the appeal period, which is begins August 10, 2022, the Veteran was service connected for a heart condition, rated 100 percent from August 10, 2022 (as granted by the Board herein); urethral stricture, rated 40 percent from August 27, 2019; diabetes mellitus, rated 20 percent from August 10, 2022; residual pyelonephritis, rated 10 percent from September 1977; hemorrhoids, rated 10 percent from November 29, 1979; and tinnitus, rated 10 percent from October 4, 2021.  The Veteran was also service connected for residual left varicocele, residual lower abdomen surgical scar, and hypertension, all of which were noncompensable at that time.  His combined disability rating is 100 percent.  Accordingly, the Veteran meets the schedular TDIU criteria.  

However, for the entire appeal period beginning August 10, 2022, the claim of entitlement to a TDIU has been rendered moot by the award of a 100 percent schedular evaluation for a heart condition.  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008); January 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative.

The Court has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a Veteran is totally disabled.  Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994), citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990).  Thus, if VA has found a Veteran to be totally disabled as a result of a particular service-connected disability or combination of disabilities pursuant to the rating schedule, there is no need, and no authority, to otherwise rate that Veteran totally disabled on any other basis.  See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding a request for TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period).

However, a grant of a 100 percent disability does not always render the issue of TDIU moot.  VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether his disabilities establish entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).  As will be discussed further below, the Board finds that the criteria for an award of SMC at the (s) level has been met, and SMC will be granted beginning August 10, 2022.

Accordingly, the grant of a total schedular rating for the Veteran's heart condition renders the claim of entitlement to a TDIU moot.  Consideration for a TDIU would result in no additional discernable benefit.  As there remains no case or controversy concerning whether the Veteran is entitled to the benefits sought, the claim for entitlement to a TDIU is moot, and it must be dismissed.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994). 

3. Entitlement to SMC at the levels set forth at 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is granted.

VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether his disabilities establish entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).  SMC is payable if a claimant has a single permanent disability rated 100 percent disabling and has either (1) additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  The disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more must be separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i)(1).

In this case, as a result of the Board's award of a 100 percent rating for the Veteran's heart condition, the criteria for SMC at the (s) level has been met beginning August 10, 2022.  During that period, in addition to a 100 percent rating for a heart condition, the Veteran is also in receipt of service connection for urethral stricture, rated 40 percent from August 27, 2019; diabetes mellitus, rated 20 percent from August 10, 2022; residual pyelonephritis, rated 10 percent from September 1977; hemorrhoids, rated 10 percent from November 29, 1979; and tinnitus, rated 10 percent from October 4, 2021.  The Veteran was also service connected for residual left varicocele, residual lower abdomen surgical scar, and hypertension, all of which were noncompensable at that time.? His combined disability rating without his heart condition was at least 60 percent from August 10, 2022.  Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran has met the basic criteria for SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), and SMC will be granted beginning August 10, 2022.
