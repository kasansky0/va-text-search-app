DOCKET NO. 240827-469781
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for vitiligo is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The approximate balance of evidence shows that the Veteran's vitiligo was caused by in-service exposure to Agent Orange.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for vitiligo have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1968 to November 1970.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on December 11, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Service connection for vitiligo (claimed as skin condition) is denied.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for vitiligo that he contends was incurred during service due to his exposure to Agent Orange during his service in Vietnam. See December 2024 Hearing Transcript. 

Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004)

Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Presumptive service connection on the basis of herbicide exposure is authorized for specified diseases. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.309. When a claimed disorder is not included as a presumptive disorder, direct service connection may nevertheless be established by evidence demonstrating that the disease is related to service, to include the in-service herbicide exposure. See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant.

To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must persuasively stand against a finding that the evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of vitiligo. See June 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

If a Veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service, certain diseases shall be service connected if the requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 1116 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii) are met, even though there is no record of such disease during service, provided further that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1113 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d) are also satisfied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). In this case, the Veteran's DD 214 notes he served in Vietnam, and the Board concedes he qualifies for the presumption of exposure to herbicides, including Agent Orange. However, the mere exposure to herbicides alone does not create a permanent disability for which compensation may be granted. The Veteran's skin condition is not one VA presumptively assumes is related to herbicide exposure. Accordingly, the evidence would need to show the Veteran's vitiligo is otherwise related to an in-service disease or injury. 

The record contains a number of lay statements.

In the June 2023 Correspondence written by the Veteran, the Veteran explained that no one in his family ever had vitiligo. See June 2023 Correspondence.

In the December 2024 Board Hearing, the Veteran testified that while he was stationed in Vietnam, he began noticing pigmentation changes on his hands and other parts of his body. See December 2024 Hearing Transcript. The Veteran explained that during service he began having to wear gloves to keep his hands from getting a sunburn. Id. The Veteran testified that this condition continued from service to today. Id. 

In the evidentiary window following the December 2024 hearing, the Veteran submitted a Buddy Statement written by his younger brother. See February 2025 Lay Statement. The Veteran's brother explained that the Veteran had "white splotches" on his arms when he returned from Vietnam, and while he did not know the cause of them, the brother "took them to be a side effect of his service in Vietnam." Id. 

The evidence reflects two medical opinions regarding the etiology of the Veteran's vitiligo.

The June 2023 private medical opinion diagnosed the Veteran with vitiligo and opined that "it is possible that the vitiligo is related to your being deployed in locations where Agent Orange was being used during the Vietnam War." See June 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

The October 2023 VA medical examination opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's vitiligo was caused by or a result of the Agent Orange exposure in service. See October 2023 C&P Examination. As rationale, the VA examiner cited the lack of in-service complaints of vitiligo and that he "was unable to locate any peer reviewed literature supporting [Agent Orange] causing vitiligo." Id. 

The Veteran is competent to report lay observable symptomatology. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). Pigmentation loss of the skin is one such lay observable symptom. As the October 2023 VA examination did not address the Veteran's lay statements, but rather was based on the absence of corroborating medical records, the examination is inadequate. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39-40 (2007). 

Unfortunately, the June 2023 private medical opinion is also not faultless. Because the private opinion stated that it was merely "possible" that the Veteran's vitiligo is related to Agent Orange, it did not apply the correct "at least as likely as not (approximate balance of evidence)" standard. See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021).

However, although the June 2023 private medical opinion stated that it was only "possible" and not "at least as likely as not" that the Veteran's vitiligo was related to service, and remand for medical opinion that uses the correct standard would be useful, the Board finds such a remand not necessary.

While the remaining record consists almost entirely of the Veteran's and his brother's lay statements, the Board cannot ignore the Veteran's reports of continuity of symptomatology since service, the Veteran's report that no family member has ever had vitiligo, and that the private medical opinion argued that it was at least "possible" that his vitiligo was related to in-service herbicide exposure. See June 2023 Correspondence; December 2024 Hearing Transcript; February 2025 Lay Statement; June 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. 

Although a remand to further develop the evidentiary record could be accomplished, the Board recognizes that further inquiry into the matter, when evidence may presently be considered at least nearly equal, could lead to a prohibited remand for negative evidence. See Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003).

Thus, after reviewing the record and weighing the relevant statements and service treatment records, the Board finds that in this particular case with its unique circumstances, the evidence for and the evidence against the existence of a causal relationship between the Veteran's vitiligo and the Veteran's in-service Agent Orange exposure is at least in approximate balance and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine applies. See Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014) ("By requiring only an 'approximate balance of positive and negative evidence'..., the nation, 'in recognition to our debt to our veterans,' has 'taken upon itself the risk of error' in awarding... benefits."). As such, the third element of service connection has been satisfied. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for the Veteran's vitiligo is warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.
