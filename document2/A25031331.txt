ORDER

The appeal on the issue of whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted to reopen a claim for service connection for a right knee disability is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time the Veteran filed his Board appeal in June 2024, the RO had not issued a decision on his claim that new and relevant evidence has been submitted to reopen a claim for service connection for a right knee disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There is no question of law or fact for review; the appeal regarding whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted to reopen a claim for service connection for a right knee disability is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty from August 1989 to August 1992. 

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals on appeal from notification letters issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), most recently on April 2, 2024.  

In June 2024, the Veteran filed a filed a decision review request: Board appeal (notice of disagreement) (VA Form 10182), electing for Direct Review Lane, citing the RO's April 2, 2024 letter.   

1.  Whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted to reopen a claim for service connection for a right knee disability.

In November 1992, the RO denied a claim for service connection for a right knee disability.  There was no appeal, and the RO's decision became final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

In August 2023, the Veteran filed an application to reopen the claim for service connection for a right knee disability (VA Form 21-526EZ).

On February 1, 2024, the RO the RO issued a decision on a number of issues, and stated that the Veteran's application to reopen his claim for service connection for a right knee disability was deferred.  The RO indicated that its decision was deferred so that the Veteran could be afforded an examination.    

On April 2, 2024, the RO sent the Veteran what is commonly referred to as an "AMA letter."  The RO notified him that it had received his request to review a claim for service connection for a right knee disability that was previously denied, but that "VA regulations require you to file this request on the proper form."  The RO's letter notified the Veteran of the three options that an appellant may elect under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) if he or she is dissatisfied with an AOJ decision.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2501, 3.2601, and 20.2020.  Given the procedural posture of the Veteran's application to reopen the claim for service connection for a right knee disability, which had not yet been adjudicated, it appears that this letter was sent in error and that it caused confusion.   

In June 2024, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182) indicating disagreement with the RO's April 2, 2024 letter. 

The RO has not yet issued a decision on the Veteran's August 2023 application to reopen his claim for service connection for a right knee disability.  The Board does not have jurisdiction until a decision is rendered by the RO and timely appeal by the Veteran.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105.  As the Board does not have jurisdiction at this time, the appeal regarding whether new and relevant evidence has been received to reopen a claim for service connection for a right knee disability must be dismissed.
