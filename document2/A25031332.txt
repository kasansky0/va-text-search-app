ORDER 

Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT 

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had migraine headaches at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW 

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from January 2002 to January 2006. 

This matter comes before the Board on a March 26, 2023, Higher Level Review rating decision. In the March 1, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 8, 2023, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence which was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is denied. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from an event, disease, or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1101, 1110, 1131, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an event, disease, or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service event, disease, or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Here, the Veteran's service treatment records show no evidence of migraine headaches and there are no treatment notes regarding symptoms of migraine headaches during active service. A November 2001 Report of Medical Examination marked everything as "normal" and a Report of Medical History of the same date specifically marked "frequent or severe headache" as "no." An October 2005 Report of Medical History also specifically marked "frequent or severe headache" as "no." A February 2023 VA examination did not diagnose the Veteran with a headache condition and did not record any symptoms of migraine headaches. 

As such, based on a review of the record before the Board, there is no diagnosis for migraine headaches, no persistent or recurrent symptoms of migraine headaches, and no evidence of functional impairment impacting earning capacity. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2018).?Therefore, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of migraine headaches and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26?Vet. App.?289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?319, 321 (2007).? 

The Board notes that in disability compensation claims, a VA medical examination must be provided when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?79, 81 (U.S. 2006). 

Here, as discussed above, there is no competent evidence of a current disability of migraine headaches or persistent or recurrent symptoms of migraine headaches.? As such, a VA medical examination is not warranted.

As the first required element for direct service connection for migraine headaches has not been met, the remaining elements will not be discussed. Romanowsky, 26?Vet. App.?at 294; McClain, 21?Vet. App.?at 321. As the evidence is not in approximate balance and persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).? Therefore, entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is denied.
