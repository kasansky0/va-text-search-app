ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right index finger nerve damage is dismissed as moot.

Entitlement to an initial disability rating greater than 10 percent for service- connected asthma is denied.

Entitlement to an increased rating for the right index finger scar, rated non-compensable (0 percent), prior to May 28, 2024, and 10 percent disabling thereafter, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During the pendency of this appeal, an October 2024 rating decision granted service connection right index finger nerve damage, effective December 21, 2022, the entirety of the period on appeal here. 

2. For the entirety of the period on appeal, the evidence does not support the Veteran's service-connected asthma was manifested with worse than FEV-1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second) 71 to 90 percent predicted, or, FEV-1/ FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) of 71 to 80 percent, or; intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy.

3. Prior to May 28, 2024, and throughout the period on appeal here, the Veteran's right index finger scar is not unstable or painful, does not affect an area of at least 39 cm (6 square inches), and does not cause functional impairment of the affected areas.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of service connection for right index finger nerve damage have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an increased initial disability rating greater than 10 percent for service-connected asthma have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.321, 4.3, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6602.

3. The criteria for an increased disability rating for the right index finger scar rated non-compensable (0 percent) prior to May 28, 2024, and 10 percent disabling thereafter, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.7, 4.20, 4.118, DCs 7801-7805.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1997 to October 2002.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from two separate December 2023 rating decisions issued by a VA Regional Office (RO).  

In January 2024, the Veteran appealed both December 2023 rating decisions (and the specific issues enumerated herein) to the Board filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), electing the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for right index finger nerve damage is dismissed as moot.

The Veteran filed her appeal stemming from a December 2022 rating decision denying service connection for a right index finger disability, considering whether there were residual manifestations either musculoskeletal or neurological, stemming from an in-service right index finger injury. 

While this appeal was pending, the Board notes the Veteran then concurrently filed, albeit improperly, a supplemental claim readjudication at the Regional Office level of the identical right index finger claim. While the Veteran never withdrew her pending Board appeal, and the AMA requires she only pursue one avenue at a time to avoid inconsistent or invalid adjudications, herein, the Board will take judicial notice that the AOJ has since, in an October 2024 rating decision, granted service connection for the said right index finger crush injury, to assigning a 30 percent rating for median nerve paralysis, an additional 10 percent rating for a separate painful scar (aside from the scar on appeal here), and denied service connection for right finger arthritis.  

The October 2024 rating decision, further, considered the period on appeal as back to December 21, 2022, which encompasses the entirety of right index finger claim here. As such, under the circumstances presented here, the Board finds that there no longer remains an identified, specific determination with which the claimant disagrees.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d). 

To be clear, the October 2024 rating decision is not on appeal here, but rather this case stems from the January 2024 Notice of Disagreement disagreeing with the December 2023 rating decision denying service connection for right index finger nerve damage.  Although these decisions were the result of improper concurrent elections, the Board will not disturb the favorable awards therein and merely takes judicial notice of them herein.  

The sole inquiry here pertained to service connection for right index finger nerve damage.  See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (noting that downstream elements, such as the initial rating and effective date, are not part of an appeal of denial of service-connection).  Where, as here, service connection has been granted for the entirety for the period on appeal, and it is impossible for the Board to grant any further benefit, the appeal is deemed moot. Cf. Johnson v. Collins, No. 23-7589, ___ Vet. App. ___ *5-6 (2025) (finding an appeal moot "only if it is impossible...to grant any effectual relief whatsoever...." (internal citations omitted)). 

As the favorable grant of service connection constitutes a complete grant of the benefit sought on appeal, the issue must be dismissed as moot.  See De Hart v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 371 (2024) (holding that downstream issues that have yet to be decided are beyond the scope of a notice of disagreement, citing Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). 

INCREASED RATINGS

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.  

In deciding this appeal, the Board has considered whether separate ratings for different periods of time, based on the facts found, are warranted, a practice of assigning ratings referred to as "staged" ratings.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

The "effective date for an increased rating, indeed, as well as for an initial rating or for staged ratings," depends on when the change in disability level can be "ascertained."  Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015).  An effective date should not be "assigned mechanically" as of the date of an examination. Id. 

2. Entitlement to an initial disability rating greater than 10 percent for service-connected asthma is denied.

The Veteran's service-connected asthma and bronchitis is currently rated 10 percent disabling under DC 8866-6602.  She contends her asthma is worse than currently rated. 

The claim stems from the initial grant of service connection, effective August 10, 2022, and, therefore, the Board will consider the severity of the disability since that time, to include whether there were any factually ascertainable increases throughout.  As will be outlined below, the evidence does not support entitlement to an increased rating at any time and, therefore, the appeal is denied. 

The DC 8866-6602 Hyphenated DCs are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional DC to identify the basis for the rating assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6602, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for bronchial asthma with FEV-1 of 71 to 80 percent predicted; or FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent; or intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy.

A 30 percent disability rating is warranted for bronchial asthma FEV-1 of 56 to 70 percent predicted, or the ratio of FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent; or, daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy, or inhalational anti-inflammatory medication. 

A 60 percent disability rating is warranted for bronchial asthma with FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids.

A 100 percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 less than 40 percent of predicted value, or FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, or diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (SB) less than 40 percent predicted, or; maximum exercise capacity less than 15 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption (with cardiac or respiratory limitation), or cor pulmonale (right heart failure), or; right ventricular hypertrophy, or pulmonary hypertension (shown by Echo or cardiac catheterization), or episode(s) of acute respiratory failure, or; requires outpatient oxygen therapy.

Additionally, when evaluating respiratory conditions based on pulmonary function tests (PFT's), post-bronchodilator results are to be used in applying the evaluation criteria in the rating schedule unless the post-bronchodilator results are poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(5).  Furthermore, when there is a disparity between the results of different PFT's, so that the level of evaluation would differ depending on which test result is used, the test result that the examiner states most accurately reflect the level of disability is to be used.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(6).  While the forgoing provisions are instructive when evaluating PFT's, 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d) does not mandate that the Board apply its provisions when evaluating the diagnostic criteria for asthma.  Indeed, the Board observes DC 6602 is specifically excluded from those required to use the provision in assessing PFT scores.  Thus, the Board may consider all scores in the file and based on the totality of the evidence assess the Veteran's entire disability picture from August 10, 2022, including all PFT results whether pre-bronchodilator or post-bronchodilator.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Turning to the relevant evidence of record, the Veteran's VA outpatient treatment records from August 2022 throughout the period on appeal show her history of asthma. 

A November 2023 Gulf War disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) reflects that the Veteran reported that she was unable to continue work as a police officer because of her asthma and the physical demands required for police work.  She reported shortness of breath even within a few minutes of running or with a brisk walk, and use of an inhaler 4 to 5 times a week.  The Veteran indicated that she had to transition to a desk job due to not being able to pass the physical fitness testing for police work due to her asthma.

In another November 2023 DBQ, the Veteran reported current asthma symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, and excess mucus.  She added that she develops a cough when she has a bronchitis flare-up.  The examining nurse practitioner (NP) noted that the Veteran's asthma required intermittent courses or bursts of systemic corticosteroids, and the Veteran indicated that she had 1 course or burst in the past 12 months.  The NP also noted that the Veteran's asthma required intermittent use of an inhalational bronchodilator therapy and anti-inflammatory medication.  The Veteran reported using nebulizer treatment approximately 2 times a month when she starts to develop a cough or increased wheezing, and an albuterol rescue inhaler 4 to 5 times weekly due to chest tightness, wheezing, and shortness of breath.  The NP noted that the Veteran's asthma required intermittent use of oral bronchodilators and use of antibiotics when in the emergency room for an asthma attack in November 2022.  The Veteran had not had any asthma attacks with episodes of respiratory failure in the past 12 months but had a physician visit for required care of an exacerbation in November 2022, less frequently than monthly.  PFT testing reflected results as follows: pre-bronchodilator FVC of 93 percent predicted; FEV-1 of 86 percent predicted; FEV-1/FVC of 74.9 percent predicted; and post-bronchodilator FVC of 93 percent predicted; FEV-1 of 83 percent predicted; and FEV-1/FVC of 72.7 percent with the NP indicating that FEV-1/FVC most accurately reflected the Veteran's level of disability.  The DBQ indicates that the Veteran's respiratory conditions impact her ability to work as she is not able to continue training as a police officer due to shortness of breath and wheezing which limit physical exertion.

In a December 2023 addendum, the physician stated that a DLCO was not performed as there was no concern for an interstitial process affect air exchange.  The physician also noted that the Veteran does not have chronic bronchitis, that the PFT was normal and did not require post-bronchodilator testing, and that the FEV-1 is the most important PFT component for obstructive pulmonary disease such as asthma.

In short, the evidence of record does not indicate manifestations warranting a disability rating higher than the 10 percent rating assigned.

While the Veteran does require inhalational and/or oral bronchodilator therapy, the evidence consistently indicates such use is intermittent and not daily, which more approximates the 10 percent criteria.  Further, the FEV-1 and FEV-1/FVC findings, even at the worst, were largely above 70 percent, and typically not in the range ordinarily associated with the higher disability ratings.

The Board considered the Veteran's complaints of asthmatic symptoms such as shortness of breath and wheezing, as well as the effect on her job function, to include having to be reassigned to a desk-assignment. These manifestations, however, are already contemplated in the schedular criteria and, therefore, the Board finds the Veteran's disability is fully capable of evaluation under the rating schedule and, indeed, under the current 10 percent rating assigned. 

In short, the persuasive weight of the evidence does not support the Veteran's appeal that her asthma warrants a rating greater than the 10 percent assigned rating at any time during the period on appeal. Indeed, her manifestations and clinical findings largely fit the criteria as contemplated in the 10 percent diagnostic criteria.  For these reasons, her appeal is denied.

3. Entitlement to an increased rating for the right index finger scar, rated non-compensable (0 percent), prior to May 28, 2024, and 10 percent disabling thereafter, is denied.

The Veteran's right index finger scar is rated noncompensable under DC 7802 prior to May 28, 2024, and 10 percent disabling under DC 7804 thereafter. 

By way of background, the Board notes she was initially service-connected for her scar, right index finger (dominant) in a March 2013 rating decision, effective July 2, 2012. On November 17, 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ seeking an increased rating for her right index finger scar. As noted above, during the pendency of this appeal, the Veteran was also awarded a separate compensable rating under DC 7804 for a painful right index finger scar, effective May 28, 2024, in an October 2024 rating decision. While this rating decision is not on appeal here, the Board takes judicial notice of the favorable award here.

As such, as to this issue on appeal, the Board finds the period on appeal stems from the November 17, 2022, increased rating claim. The Board will consider the severity of the scar from this point in time, to include whether there was a factually ascertainable increase within the year preceding the filing of the claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

The diagnostic codes 7801-7805 (for scars) were revised effective October 23, 2008.  The regulatory changes pertaining to the rating of scars apply only to applications received by VA on or after October 23, 2008, or if the Veteran requests review under the clarified criteria.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 54708 (Sept. 23, 2008).  As the Veteran's application for a higher rating for a right index finger scar was received after that date, the revised criteria are applicable.

The Board notes that VA again amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities on August 13, 2018.  With regard to the effective date of the new criteria, VA indicated in the Supplementary Information to the Final Rule that its "intent is that the claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the veteran will be applied."  The Veteran's claim in this case was not pending prior to the August 13, 2018 effective date of the new criteria.  Therefore, the Board will consider only the new criteria.

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has no scars or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck.  Therefore, DC 7800 (scars of the head, face, or neck) is not applicable.

Under DC 7801, a 10 percent rating is warranted for scars or burn scars due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage with an area or areas of at least 6 square inches (39 sq. cm.) but less than 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.). A 20 percent rating is warranted for an area or areas of at least 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.) but less than 72 square inches (465 sq. cm.).  A 30 percent rating is warranted for an area or areas of at least 72 square inches (465 sq. cm.) but less than 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.).  A 40 percent rating is warranted for an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater. Note (1) provides that, for the purposes of DCs 7801 and 7802, the six (6) zones of the body are defined as each extremity, anterior trunk, and posterior trunk.  The midaxillary line divides the anterior trunk from the posterior trunk.  Note (2) provides that a separate evaluation may be assigned for each affected zone of the body under this diagnostic code if there are multiple scars, or a single scar, affecting multiple zones of the body.  Combine the separate evaluations under 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  Alternatively, if a higher evaluation would result from adding the areas affected from multiple zones of the body, a single evaluation may also be assigned under this diagnostic code.

Under DC 7802, a 10 percent rating is warranted for burn scars or scars not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, for an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.

Under DC 7804, one or more scars that are unstable or painful warrant a 10 percent rating; three or four scars that are unstable or painful warrant a 20 percent rating; five or more scars that are unstable or painful warrant a 30 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804.  These provisions were not changed by the August 13, 2018, revision. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804. Note (1) to DC 7804 provides that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar and that a superficial scar is one not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804.  For DC 7804, Note (2) provides that that if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, 10 percent will be added to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars.  Note (3) provides that scars evaluated under DCs 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may receive additional evaluation under DC 7804 when applicable.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804.

Under DC 7805, other scars, including linear scars, and other effects of scars evaluated under DCs 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804, any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under DCs 7800 through 7804 will be evaluated under an appropriate diagnostic code.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7805.  Effective as of August 13, 2018, the phrase "including linear scars" was deleted from DC 7805; otherwise, the criteria remain the same.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7805.

Turning to the relevant evidence of record, VA outpatient treatment records are silent as to any complaints or treatment relevant to the right index finger scar. While complaints of right finger pain related to range of motion and function are noted in the relevant treatment records, these are not attributed to the scar. For example, in March 2019, the Veteran was seen for a hand surgery consultation related to complaints of a feeling of tightness and stiffness in her right index finger at the joints.  The record specifically indicated a healed scar. Occupational therapy was recommended.

A December 2022 DBQ reflects that the Veteran has a right index finger scar and has more than one scar on her body, but none on her head, face, or neck.  The NP indicated that the scar is not painful, unstable, and not due to burns.  It was located on the palmer surface of the right index finger, vertical, well healed, and is a non-tender scar which measures 3.5 by 0.25 cm.  The approximate total area of scars without underlying tissue damage of the right upper extremity was 0.88 cm2.  

The DBQ reflects that the scars do not result in limitation of function and that the Veteran does not have any other pertinent findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms associated with the scar.  The Veteran reported that the scar impacted her ability to work as she worked in law enforcement and the scar affected her ability to use a gun.  She stated that the reduced motion and flexibility of the index finger affects her ability to type.

Analysis

In short, the evidentiary record here does not indicate the Veteran's service-connected right index finger scar was manifested by any compensable symptomatology under any arguably applicable diagnostic code.

While the Board recognizes that she now is compensated for a painful scar under Diagnostic Code 7804, the evidentiary record permissibly before the Board under this docketed appeal does not contain evidence supporting a painful scar such that a 10 percent rating under DC 7804 would be warranted prior to May 2024. Indeed, there is evidence to the contrary. The December 2022 DBQ reflects that her scar was not painful.  

The Board also considered other diagnostic codes, but similarly finds no other arguably applicable provision that would provide a compensable rating. While the Veteran reported various functional limitations affecting her "trigger finger," that she believed was due to her scar, the DBQ and indeed the accompanying CAPRI records show that, in fact, her functional limitations in said finger were not due to the scar or otherwise medically attributed to her scar. Indeed, no functional impairment was medically attributed to her scar. 

Further, the December 2022 NP noted that the Veteran's scar is not painful or unstable, and did not cover a total area equal to or greater than 39 square cm.  The March 2019 VA outpatient treatment records indicated the Veteran's scar was healed and was not associated with the complained of tightness and stiffness complained of at that time. Indeed, the functional impairments described by the Veteran have already been compensated by a separate rating for the median nerve paralysis in her right index finger. 

As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's disability picture is fully capable of evaluation under the rating schedule.

(Continued on the next page)

?

As the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the Board finds the Veteran's appeal seeking a compensable rating for her right index finger scar prior to May 2024 to not be warranted. The appeal is, therefore, denied.
