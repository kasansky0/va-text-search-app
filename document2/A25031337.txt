ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for eczema is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date of May 31, 2022, but no earlier, for a rating of 30 percent for eczema is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's eczema was characterized by characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body and systemic therapy for 6 weeks or more, but not constantly or near-constantly.  

2. An increase in severity of the Veteran's service-connected eczema was factually ascertainable on May 31, 2022, within one year of his August 2022 intent to file.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for eczema are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7806.

2.  The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of May 31, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of a 30 percent rating for eczema are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155(a), 3.400, 4.118, DC 7806.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 2002 to March 2007.  

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from November 2022 and October 2023 rating decisions.

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. In an October 26, 2023 letter, the Board informed the Veteran that his appeal had been placed on the Board's Direct Review docket and noted that evidence submitted with his Notice of Disagreement could not be considered unless he elected to switch Board dockets. The Veteran did not subsequently elect to switch Board dockets.

Therefore, with respect to the claim for an earlier effective date for the Veteran's 30 percent rating for eczema, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. With respect to the claim for a rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's eczema, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the related claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As a final preliminary matter, the Board notes that in his Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran also stated he was seeking review of a February 2023 rating decision that identified a duty to assist error in connection with his claim for a rating in excess of 30 percent for eczema.  However, a decision that merely refers to future action (in this instance, the need for further development) is not an appealable AOJ decision.  More to the point, the underlying issue of entitlement to a higher rating for eczema was subsequently decided in the October 2023 rating decision that the Veteran also appealed.  Accordingly, the Board will take not further action on the purported appeal of the February 2023 rating decision.  

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for eczema is denied.

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects their ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing their symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.10. If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. However, where an increase in the disability rating, rather than the propriety of the initial rating, is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance, and past medical reports should not take precedence over current findings. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Regardless of whether an appeal stems from disagreement with the initial rating assigned following an award of service connection or from disagreement with the rating assigned following a claim for increase, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007) (citing Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999)).

Eczema is rated under DC 7806, which is rated under the General Rating Formula For The Skin ("General Formula").  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  

Under the General Formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.  

A 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period.  

A 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.  

A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.  

Or, the condition may be rated as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DCs 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating For The Skin For DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824.

Systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route (orally, injection, suppository, intranasally) other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).  

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's eczema, because the evidence of record does not establish characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy.

The VA examiner who evaluated the Veteran's eczema in November 2022 described it as being characterized by "patchy scaly white patches on the trunk and extremities."  The examiner found that 20 to 40 percent of the Veteran's total body area was affected by eczema, to include no exposed areas and with no scarring or disfigurement.  November 2022 C&P exam (Skin Disease Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)).  A private medical opinion stated that the Veteran had "moderate" eczema that affected 20 percent of the Veteran's total body surface area, including his hands.  November 2022 Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility (MTR-NGF) (5/31/2022 exam).  

The record establishes that the Veteran has received injections of Dupixent (a biologic) for 6 weeks or more, but his use of it has not been constant or near constant. See November 2022 C&P exam (Skin Disease DBQ) (documenting the Veteran's report of receiving Dupixent injections every 114 days). The Veteran has also been prescribed topical corticosteroids for his condition. See May 2022 CAPRI (3/24/2021 nurse practitioner note) (noting prescription of "short course of topical steroids ... to use only sparingly"); November 2022 C&P exam (Skin Disease DBQ) (noting use of topical corticosteroids).  A private provider prescribed two topical creams-Elidel and Triamcinolone Acetonide.  November 2022 MTR-NGF. 

An addendum opinion was sought regarding the Veteran's use of topical steroids.  A VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's prescribed steroid treatments were not systemic therapy, stating that "[s]ystemic therapy, by definition, must be absorbed by the bloodstream, therefore, topical therapy, no matter how extensive, should not be considered systemic therapy." April 2023 C&P exam (Medical Opinion DBQ). The Board notes that the regulations applicable to this appeal define systemic and topical therapy, as discussed above. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).

The Veteran has stated that he has eczema "all over" his body.  November 2022 C&P exam (Skin Disability DBQ).  

The first elements of the diagnostic criteria for either a 30 or 60 percent rating involves the total skin area affected by characteristic lesions.  There appears to be conflicting evidence with regard to the total surface area of the Veteran's body that is affected by eczema.  The Veteran asserts that he has eczema "all over" his body.  This suggests highly pervasive eczema covering large sections of his body.  However, "all over" is not a clearly defined term.  There is no indication that the Veteran contends that his body is literally entirely covered by eczema, and this statement could reasonably be interpreted to mean that he has it in various locations on his body as opposed to entirely covering his body.  Short of that, there is no evidence of record quantifying the Veteran's contention regarding his total affected body area with any specificity.  Further, the term "all over" does not necessarily conflict with the observations of the medical examiners included in the evidence of record.  Rather than indicating something close to 100 percent coverage, the term "all over" may simply mean that there are at least some patches of eczema distributed generally around his body.    

Two medical examiners, one private and one from VA, quantified the total area of the Veteran's skin affected by eczema.  They described the total area covered as being either 20 percent or between 20 to 40 percent, respectively.  In addition to being competent medical professionals, both examiners had the advantage of being able to view the Veteran's skin from all angles. There is no indication that the Veteran's skin condition was presenting in a less severe manner than usual during his clinical evaluations.   

The Board emphasizes that this is not a matter of personal credibility.  The Board finds the Veteran to be highly credible.  However, the medical observations are simply better quantified and based on a better visual perspective of the Veteran's overall skin condition.  For these reasons, the Board finds the medical evidence persuasive and finds that 20 to 40 percent of the total area of the Veteran's body is affected by eczema.

The next element in the rating criteria refers to what percentage, if any, of exposed areas are covered by characteristic lesions. Exposed areas include such areas as the face and hands.  There is some evidence indicating that lesions are visible on the Veteran's hands, which are an exposed area, but there is no evidence reflecting that more than 40 percent of the exposed area of the Veteran's body (face, neck, and hands) is affected.  The VA examiner stated that exposed areas were not affected at all.  November 2022 C&P exam (Skin Disease DBQ).

The last element in the rating criteria involves the use of systemic therapy.  The evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's use of steroid therapy was topical, rather than systemic.  However, the Board finds his use of Dupixent via injection was a systemic therapy under the definition in 38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).  This systemic therapy was needed for 6 weeks or more but was not constant or near-constant. The Board finds use every 114 days, or approximately three times per year, is not near-constant.    

The Board has considered whether any other diagnostic codes related to disabilities of the skin would provide for a higher disability evaluation.  However, the evidence does not reflect that the Veteran's eczema would warrant a higher rating under another applicable diagnostic code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

In sum, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran has characteristic lesions over 20 to 40 percent of his total body and received systemic therapy for 6 weeks or more, but not constantly or near-constantly, during the period under review.  This level of severity most closely approximates the criteria for a 30 percent rating.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 30 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim for increase must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

2. Entitlement to an effective date of May 31, 2022, but no earlier, for a rating of 30 percent for eczema is granted.

The AOJ awarded the Veteran a 30 percent rating for eczema with an effective date of August 11, 2022.  November 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for that rating.  October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Regarding claims for increase, an increased rating may be assigned no earlier than the date the claim for an increase is received, unless it is factually ascertainable that the increase in disability occurred within the one-year period prior to the filing of a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  If the worsening occurred more than one year prior to the date of the claim, the effective date can be no earlier than the date of the claim.  Id. 

The Veteran was awarded a noncompensable initial rating with an effective date of March 29, 2007, when service connection for eczema was granted.  October 2007 Rating Decision. A compensable rating for eczema was subsequently denied in a May 2010 rating decision, after the Veteran filed a claim for increase. The Veteran did not appeal that decision, and new and material evidence was not received within a year of that decision. Thus, that decision became final.

The Veteran did not file another claim for an increased rating for eczema until he filed the instant claim. He submitted notice of his intent to file this claim on August 10, 2022. See August 11, 2022 Notification Letter (noting intent to file was received on August 10th). He submitted a claim for an increased rating for eczema on October 31, 2022.  October 2022 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation).  As such, an effective date may be assigned no earlier than August 10, 2022, unless it is factually ascertainable that the increase in disability occurred within the one-year period prior to that date.  

Here, it is factually ascertainable that a 30 percent rating for eczema was warranted as of May 31, 2022.  On that date, a private medical provider examined the Veteran and concluded that the Veteran's eczema affected 20 percent of his total body surface area.  November 2022 MTR-NGF.  This finding meets the criteria for a rating of 30 percent based on characteristic lesions affecting 20 to 40 percent of the body.  

The May 31, 2022, examination occurred within one year of the August 2022 intent to file.   

Accordingly, entitlement to an effective date of May 31, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of a 30 percent rating for eczema is granted.
