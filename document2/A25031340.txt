ORDER

An initial compensable rating for rhinitis is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

During the period on appeal, the evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's rhinitis was manifested by greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides, complete obstruction on one side, or polyps.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial compensable rating for rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from June 2010 to December 2014, to include service in Afghanistan. His decorations include the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. The Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in April 2024, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of issuance of the AOJ rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after that decision was promulgated.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the Veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify that evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for rhinitis.

The Veteran is in receipt of a 0 (zero) percent (noncompensable) rating for his service-connected rhinitis, effective August 10, 2022 . On appeal, he seeks a higher rating.

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is in turn based on the average impairment of earning capacity caused by a given disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the evaluations to be assigned to the various disabilities.

The law mandates resolving reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. If there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. If different disability ratings are warranted for different periods of time over the life of a claim, "staged" ratings may be assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).

Allergic and vasomotor rhinitis are evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6522. Under that diagnostic code, a 10 percent rating is warranted for rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. A 30 percent rating is warranted if the disability is manifested by polyps. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in connection with his claim in March 2024. He reported onset of rhinitis in 2015. He related that the condition was mild in the beginning, but then started getting worse in 2016. He indicated that he would have cough and congestion, clearing of his throat, and sneezing. He reported that VA had given him some allergy medication, and that it helped but did not make it fully better. It was noted that he used chlorpheniramine, but still had congestion, sneezing, and postnasal drip.

The examiner noted a diagnosis of non-allergic rhinitis and documented that the Veteran did not have greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides, did not have complete obstruction on either the left or right side, did not have polyps, did not have permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, and did not have a granulomatous condition. The examiner also noted that the condition had no impact on the Veteran's ability to work.

Medical treatment records during the period on appeal show that the Veteran was seen by a VA physician's assistant in July 2023 and was prescribed fexofenadine. He complained of a tickle and phlegm in his throat, in addition to constantly clearing his throat. The provider noted postnasal drip and phlegm in his throat. During an August 2023 VA visit, the Veteran reported that the allergy medication he previously received helped halfway, but when he doubled the dose, it helped with clearing his throat. The Veteran reported having allergies with constant throat clearing for years, with his symptoms staying the same over the years. He was prescribed azelastine and chlorpheniramine, in addition to continuing fexofenadine. During a September 2023 Persian Gulf registry exam, the Veteran reported symptoms of chronic sinus congestion for more than 3 weeks and using Vicks to treat the symptoms. He also endorsed having hay fever and allergy symptoms such as runny nose, sneezing, and nasal congestion with a cough and sputum or phlegm production lasting for more than 3 weeks. He stated that he had been going to the VA for a few years for his phlegm. He also reported that his nose was itchy at times, that he tended to cough a lot if he did not try to clear his throat, and that he would constantly have to clear his throat in order to avoid coughing. 

In light of the foregoing, the Board must find that the Veteran's rhinitis symptoms were most consistent with the criteria for a noncompensable rating throughout the period on appeal. In short, the evidence available for review does not show the presence of polyps, a greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passages on both sides, or complete obstruction on one side of the nasal passages at any time during the period on appeal. Nor is there any evidence to show that he would have such manifestations but for the ameliorative effects of medication. See, e.g., Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798 (U.S. Vet. App. March 12, 2025); Jones (David J.) v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012). As outlined above, although he has reported using medication for treatment of congestion lasting a few weeks, he has indicated that he primarily uses medication to reduce phlegm in his throat; which is not a basis for the assignment of a higher rating.

As the evidence weighs persuasively against the Veteran's claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application. See 38 U.S.C.§ 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The appeal is denied.
