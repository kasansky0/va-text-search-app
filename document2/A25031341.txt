ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his OSA is related to his active service.

 CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for OSA have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107;?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1999 to February 2010.

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2023 supplemental claim rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the December 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review. The Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

As a final introductory matter, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran attempted to appeal various disability claims rating decisions from December 2015, June 2016, October 2017, and May 2018 rating decisions. Under the AMA, an appeal of previously denied claims must be filed on the proper forms within one year from the date of the issuance of notice of decision. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). In the case where a claimant elects to opt-in to review of a decision under VA's modernized (AMA) review system, the claimant shall file for an appropriate review option within the time allowed for filing a substantive appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 19.52(a). If a timely filing is not received, the claim shall not thereafter be readjudicated or allowed, except by higher-level review, supplemental claim, or by a showing of good cause for untimely filing. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c). 

The Veteran has not indicated or filed anything that would allow the Board to waive the claims processing rule for the December 2015, October 2017, and May 2018 rating decisions. There is no June 2016 rating decision of record. Therefore, the Board will not address those claims, as the appeals have not been properly initiated under either the AMA or the legacy system.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

A Veteran is entitled to VA disability compensation if there is a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service.?38 U.S.C. § 1110;?38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. Shedden v. Principi,?381 F.3d 1163, 1167?(Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Service connection means the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated by service. This may be accomplished by affirmatively showing inception or aggravation during service.?38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for disability shown after service, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, shows that it was incurred in service.?38 C.F.R. § 3.303?(d). In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology. See Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 470?(1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.?38 U.S.C. § 7104?(a); Baldwin v. West,?13?Vet. App.?1?(1999); see?38 C.F.R. § 3.303?(a). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.?38 U.S.C. § 5107;?38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski,?1?Vet. App.?49, 53?(1990). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for OSA is granted.

The Veteran is seeking to establish service connection for?OSA?as related to service. After a review of the entire evidentiary record and in light of the applicable legal criteria, the Board affords the Veteran reasonable doubt and grants service connection for?OSA. 

To begin, the first and second elements of service connection have been met. In the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran met the current disability requirement based on an August 2016 diagnosis of sleep apnea and that the evidence shows a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service. See August 2016 AmeriSleep Diagnostics Sleep Study; see December 2023 Rating Decision. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Turning to the third element of service connection, evidence of a nexus between the Veteran's OSA and service, the evidence in favor of the claim includes in-service treatment records (STRs) for symptoms of OSA with the use of a CPAP machine and positive nexus medical opinions regarding the etiology of the Veteran's OSA from a private provider and from a VA examiner.

The probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion that the physician reaches.  Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993). Whether a physician provides a basis for a medical opinion goes to the weight or credibility of the evidence in the adjudication of the merits. See Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998). Other factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims folder and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008). It is within the purview of the Board to evaluate the medical evidence and favor one medical opinion over another. See also D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 107 (2008).

Prior to active-duty service, the Veteran reported no trouble sleeping. see October 1999 Entrance examination.

In-service, the evidence of record shows that in March 2002, the Veteran complained of daytime fatigue, persisting for the prior six months. In April 2002, treatment notes show he complained of daytime fatigue and excessive snoring. See April 2002 STRs. The examiner noted that fellow service members did not want to room with him because of his excessive snoring. Id. Subsequently, the Veteran underwent a sleep study and was prescribed a CPAP machine "to use for treatment of his OSA." See August 2002 STRs. Between 2002 and 2006, the records show that the Veteran consistently reported the use of the CPAP machine to treat his OSA. In April 2006 the Veteran underwent another sleep study in service. See April 2006 Sleep Solutions Medical Records. An examiner interpreted the results of the Veteran's sleep study and diagnosed him with minimal obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Id. In July 2008, a VA examination shows the Veteran reported he had "been advised to have surgery for sleep apnea as an alternate treatment." 

In August 2017, the Veteran's private provider, Dr. S.K, provided a positive nexus medical opinion. The provider opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's current OSA is related to this active-duty service because he was diagnosed with OSA in service. The provider noted that the Veteran's symptoms in service included snoring, witnessed apneas, and daytime fatigue. He noted that the Veteran's current symptoms included "loud snoring and disordered sleep". Lastly, the provider indicated that the Veteran has had sleep apnea for "many years," referential to the medical evidence in service and the Veteran's current symptomatology. The Board finds this medical opinion to be of high probative value, as the provider reviewed the Veteran's in-service medical records and provided a rationale based on the onset of his symptoms and the progression of his condition.  

In August 2022, a VA examiner provided a positive nexus medical opinion following a VA  examination. The examiner opined that the Veteran's OSA was at least as likely as not related to his military service. Specifically, the examiner referred to the use of a CPAP machine in service, as well as the two sleep studies in finding that the Veteran had "ongoing treatment" for an OSA condition that continued after the release of active duty. The Board affords this medical opinion high probative value because the examiner's findings were based on a review of the records and the rationale was based on the onset and progression of his symptoms.

The evidence against the claim includes negative nexus opinions by VA examiners in August 2017, September 2017, November 2017, and April 2023. All three examiners reviewed the Veteran's STRs and stated that the diagnosis in service did not meet the clinical criteria for a diagnosis. None of the examiners provided a rationale for the etiology of the Veteran's current OSA, beyond advancing age. It is noted that the Veteran's age was 31 years old when he began treatment with a CPAP machine and was 48 years old at the time of his OSA diagnosis in 2016. Each examiner found that the Veteran's symptoms began in service. The Board notes that the "current disability" requirement for establishing entitlement to service connection requires a current or present disability that existed either at the time of the filing of the claim or during the pendency of the claim. Shedden,?381 F.3d at 1165.The nexus element of establishing entitlement to service connection does not require a showing that the claimed disability was diagnosed in service, but rather, that there is a current disability that was incurred during active duty service. None of the negative nexus opinions of record adequately address the etiology of the Veteran's OSA. Each examiner merely reiterates that the Veteran's OSA did not meet diagnostic criteria in service. As there is no adequate rationale provided for finding that the Veteran's OSA is not connected to his military service, the Board affords these opinions no probative weight.

The Board has considered in detail the medical opinions of record and the record as a whole. Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the evidence supports a nexus between the Veteran's current?OSA?disability and his military service. As all elements of service connection have been satisfied, service connection for?OSA?is granted. See?38 U.S.C. § 1110;?38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).
