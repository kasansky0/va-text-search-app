REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for hypertension is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's claim to establish SMC based on housebound criteria effective May 25, 2022 was granted in a December 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal to establish service connection establish SMC based on housebound criteria effective May 25, 2022 has been abrogated, leaving no question of law or fact in controversy.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1976 to February 1979, and July 1991 to November 1991.  This matter is before the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) from a June 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The June 2023 rating decision is a higher level review of a December 2022 rating decision.  

In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a claim seeking entitlement to special monthly compensation for housebound status or permanent need for regular aid and attendance.  In October 2022, the Veteran filed an Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits seeking an increased disability rating for hypertension.  In December 2022, the RO continued the Veteran's noncompensable disability rating for hypertension, and denied the claims seeking entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance and housebound status.  In a December 2024 rating decision, the RO granted the Veteran entitlement to SMC based on housebound criteria from May 25, 2022.  

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, which was subject to a higher level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal, and it was not considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to a compensable disability rating for hypertension and entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound criteria is dismissed.

In December 2024, after this appeal was perfected to the Board via an October 2023 VA Form 10182, entitlement to SMC based on housebound criteria effective May 25, 2022 was granted by the RO.  The claim was filed on November 1, 2022.  This grant of entitlement to SMC based on housebound criteria constitutes a full grant of benefits.  Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  As such, there are no additional benefits available to the Veteran and no case and controversy remaining before the Board regarding this appealed issue.  As such, the appeal must be dismissed. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for hypertension is remanded.

The Veteran is of the position that he is entitled to a compensable disability rating for hypertension.  In his October 2022 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, the Veteran stated that he has been having problems with his high blood pressure.  

The Board finds that a VA examination was warranted to assess the severity of the Veteran's service-connected hypertension prior to the December 2022 rating decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.327 (a) (providing that reexaminations will be requested whenever VA needs to determine the current severity of a disability).  

The Veteran was granted service connection for hypertension in August 2013.  Since that time, the Veteran submitted a statement indicating that he is continuing to have issues with his hypertension.  Further, VA treatment records from prior to December 2022 show an increase in blood pressure.  In January 2022 his blood pressure was 105/65.  In June 2022 it was 134/82, and in September 2022 it was 137/83.  A VA examination for his hypertension has not taken place since he has been granted service connection.  Considering that the Veteran has not had a VA examination for hypertension in more than ten years, coupled with medical evidence of an increase in severity, the Board finds that the current evidence of record does not adequately reveal the present state of the Veteran's service-connected hypertension. See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991) (where the record does not adequately reveal the current state of the claimant's disability, a VA examination must be conducted); see also Caffrey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 377, 381 (1994) (wherein the Court determined the Board should have ordered a contemporaneous examination of the Veteran because a 23-month old exam was too remote in time to adequately support the decision in an appeal for an increased rating); Palczewski v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 174, 181-82 (2007), citing Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 505-06 (1998) ("Where the record does not adequately reveal the current state of the claimant's disability the fulfillment of the statutory duty to assist requires a thorough and contemporaneous medical examination."); see also Snuffer v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 400, 403 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 11-95 (1995).  The Board finds that this is a predecisional duty to assist error and a remand is warranted.  

2. Entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance is remanded.

As the Veteran is seeking SMC based at least in part on his service-connected hypertension, the claim for SMC is inextricably intertwined and is remanded herein.  Accordingly, the Board must defer consideration of the SMC claims at this time.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (holding that where a decision on one issue would have a "significant impact" upon another, and that impact in turn could render any appellate review on the other claim meaningless and a waste of judicial resources, the two claims are inextricably intertwined).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current nature and severity of his service-connected hypertension. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.  All examination findings, along with the complete rationale for all opinions expressed, must be set forth in the examination report.
