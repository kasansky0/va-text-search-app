ORDER

Entitlement to a survivor's pension is denied.  

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not serve on active duty during wartime.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a survivor's pension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 101, 1521; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2, 3.3, 3.6.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1958 to February 1963.  He died in October 2022 and the appellant filed a claim for benefits as his surviving spouse.  

The decision on appeal in this case was issued in March 2023.  In October 2023, the appellant filed VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) or Board appeal, choosing a docket with direct review by a Veterans Law Judge under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  Direct review is a docket option for an appeal to the Board in which a Board decision is issued based on evidence of record at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a hearing or accept into the record additional evidence in its direct review of the evidence.  

Therefore, in this case, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board at this time.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the appellant would like VA to consider any new evidence, she may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are to be included with this decision.  

The appellant had previously submitted a VA Form 10182 in September 2023, simultaneously with a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review.  The concurrent review requests could not be processed, and after clarification from the Board was sought, the appellant filed the October 2023 VA Form 10182 which was accepted, docketing the case the same month.  

In her valid October 2023 VA Form 10182, the issue on appeal was described as seeking eligibility for a portion of the Veteran's service-connected disability rating from his lifetime, noting there were outstanding bills from the nursing home and doctors, and the appellant stated that he had been denied in a March 7, 2023 decision "because he did not service in Vietnam" though emphasizing her husband served in the United States Army proudly, touring overseas in Korea and France.  After a review of the record, and liberally construing the July 2020 VA Form 10182, 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a), the Board finds that only the issue of entitlement to a survivor's pension is on appeal.  

In the March 2023 decision, the AOJ also denied dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) and accrued benefits.  

As also noted above, based on the history of the appeal, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a survivor's pension as the only issue on appeal.  First, the October 2023 VA Form 10182 filed by the appellant only references seeking money for outstanding medical and care bills and noting the nature of her husband's military service.  See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023) (requiring VA to review the decision identified by the appellant where more than one decision adjudicating the same issue was issued by VA in the year prior to the VA Form 10182).  Second, the VA Form 10182 does not in any way reference entitlement to DIC benefits or accrued benefits.  Finally, the March 2023 decision denied pension for lack of wartime service, which is specifically the focus of the appellant's October 2023 VA Form 10182, an element cited in relation to a pension claim.  Thus, the Board finds that the appellant intended to appeal only the issue of entitlement to a survivor's pension.  

Entitlement to Survivor's Pension

The appellant claims she is entitled to a survivor's pension.  See February 2023 application for benefits.  However, in this case, the appellant's claim must be denied because the Veteran did not have the requisite wartime service.  

Pension is payable to a surviving spouse if the Veteran served during a period of war.  38 U.S.C. § 1541(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.3, 3.314(b).  The service requirements of that section are met if the Veteran served in active military, naval, or air service: (1) for 90 days or more during a period of war; (2) during a period of war and was discharged or released from service for a service-connected disability; (3) for a period of 90 consecutive days or more and such period began or ended during a period of war; or (4) for an aggregate of 90 days or more in two or more separate periods of service during more than one period of war.  38 U.S.C. § 1521(j); 38 C.F.R. § 3.3(a)(3); see also [https://www.va.gov/pension/eligibility/] (Eligibility For Veterans Pension | Eligible Wartime Period).  

Here, the Veteran served on active duty from January 20, 1958 to February 19, 1963.  

The Korean conflict ended January 31, 1955, almost three years prior to the Veteran's entry into active-duty service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2.  

The Vietnam era for Veterans who served outside the Republic of Vietnam did not begin until August 5, 1964, over a year after the Veteran's service ended.  There is no indication of additional service thereafter or service located in the Republic of Vietnam.

For Veterans benefits purposes, under law, the Veteran in this case did not have wartime service.  Thus, the Veteran's active-duty service does not coincide with a period of war as defined by VA regulation, and entitlement to a survivor's pension must be denied.  

The Board acknowledges that the appellant has submitted statements regarding her outstanding debt and has reviewed documentation showing bills in collection status.  However, despite those submissions, in the absence of wartime service, entitlement to survivor's pension cannot be established.  While the Board is sympathetic to her individual situation, no additional benefits have been identified for which the appellant is entitled to under law.  Thus, the claim is denied.
