REMANDED

Entitlement to a clothing allowance for calendar year 2019 is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1971 to November 1973, November 1990 to June 1991, and January 2002 to December 2003.

This appeal is before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) from a July 2021 determination by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). 

In the September 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. §?20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of clothing allowance for 2019, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The record is missing a significant amount of documentation concerning a clothing allowance for calendar year 2019. The claims file does not contain a copy of the initial claims application, VHA prosthetics records, or any pre-decisional evidence submitted or developed in relation to the claim. The substantive decision by the VHA is also missing from the claims file. 

Due process requires that the AOJ ensure that a copy of the record before it is made available for the Board's review in connection with the appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103 (requiring notice to claimants of required information and evidence), 5104 (requiring specific information in the notice of a decision), 5107 (requiring the Secretary to consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case). The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Accordingly, on remand, the records relating to the Veteran's clothing allowance claims for the year of 2019 should be obtained and associated with the claims file.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the electronic claim file all evidence considered in connection with the claim on appeal.

The record should include (but is not limited to): the Veteran's application for a clothing allowance for 2019, the 2019 VHA decision on appeal, and any other relevant documents received or generated in connection with the claim, to include any VHA or prosthetics records.

2. If any such records are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability and provide the appellant with notice of the unavailability of records.
