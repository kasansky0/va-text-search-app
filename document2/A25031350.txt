DOCKET NO. 240703-453330
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for colon cancer is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Colon cancer is not related to any established in-service incurrence, to include asbestos exposure. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for colon cancer have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the United States Navy from April 1969 to January 1971. 

The appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 rating decision.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. On October 1, 2024, the Veteran, through counsel, withdrew the hearing request. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

In general, service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Generally, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. All information, lay evidence and medical evidence in a case is to be considered by the Board in deciding the claim. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for colon cancer is denied. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for colon cancer, which he contends is related to toxic substance exposure during military service. See November 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). No specific toxic substance was identified. 

The Veteran claimed exposure to Agent Orange. A February 2025 Board decision in docket 240830-467430, contained the following finding: "the Board will resolve all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor to find that the Veteran served within the territorial waters of Vietnam.  Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran's service aboard the USS Newport News qualifies as service in the Republic of Vietnam under 38 U.S.C. §§ 1116."  Under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a) and 3.309(e), colon cancer is not listed as a disease subject to presumptive service connection based on exposure to herbicide agents.  Although there is no presumptive service connection for colon cancer due to exposure to herbicides, the Board will consider direct service connection or other presumptive service connection.  

A March 2024 VA Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) memorandum noted the Veteran had possible asbestos exposure aboard the USS Newport News. 

A March 2024 VA examination noted the Veteran had an intestinal neoplasm, diagnosed in March 2017. In an associated March 2024 VA medical opinion, the clinician noted consideration of the TERA memorandum, which showed possible asbestos exposure through inhalation, daily, without the use of personal protective equipment. The clinician noted review of multiple sources, noted the typical risk factors for the claimed condition, and noted the cancer was the third most common in the United States, and noted that there was no medical or scientific evidence to support a correlation between asbestos and rectal cancer. The clinician opined the claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. 

The Veteran's counsel contends, in December 27, 2024, correspondence, that the March 2024 VA medical opinion was inadequate, noting the examiner failed to provide any analysis or discussion of why the TERA did not cause the colon cancer. 

The Board finds the March 2024 VA medical opinion to be adequate and probative. The opinion was adequate in addressing the primary question at hand, in stating there is no medical or scientific evidence to support a correlation between asbestos and rectal cancer and noting that medical literature on the matter was reviewed. The examiner's notations regarding the frequency of colon cancer and the known risk factors help provide background but are not dispositive of the issue at hand -rather, they support the notion of the examiner having researched and weighed the possibility of the claimed link. 

The Board notes there is no competent evidence of record to the contrary-neither the Veteran nor counsel have submitted any competent evidence suggesting a causal relationship between asbestos and colon cancer. Moreover, the weight of the evidence does not establish any other in-service toxic exposure, and the VA thus had no obligation to obtain any broader medical opinion.  Furthermore, there is no evidence that supports a finding of direct service connection for the Veteran's diagnosed colon cancer/intestinal neoplasm.  

As the weight of the evidence of record does not establish a medical nexus between the Veteran's colon cancer and the asbestos exposure and does not establish any other in-service toxic substance exposure, service connection on a direct basis must be denied. There is no doubt to resolve in this matter, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021), affirmed en banc Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran has not raised any other issues, theories of service connection, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, for the Board's consideration. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
