ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a left foot fallen arch, also claimed as a musculoskeletal foot condition, is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis, also claimed as a musculoskeletal foot condition, is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence weighs persuasively against finding that the Veteran has a currently present back disability.

2. The evidence weighs persuasively against finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of CFS.

3. The evidence weighs persuasively against finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of sleep apnea.

4. Asymptomatic mild bilateral pes planus was noted at induction, and the probative evidence of record does not establish that the condition was aggravated by active service.

5. The evidence weighs persuasively against finding the Veteran has any other current diagnosis of a left or right foot disability, to include bilateral plantar fasciitis, that had its onset during active service, or is otherwise etiologically related to service. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a back disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1131, 1137, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2024).

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for CFS have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303 (2024).

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303 (2024).

4. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a left foot fallen arch, also claimed as a musculoskeletal foot condition, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1113, 1131, 1153, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.306 (2024). 

5. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis, also claimed as a musculoskeletal foot condition, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1113, 1131, 1153, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.306 (2024). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service from October 1985 to June 1989, with additional service in the Reserves and Guard. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence before the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of the August 2023 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board acknowledges that evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. As the Board is deciding the claims of service connection for a back disability, CFS, sleep apnea, left foot fallen arch, and bilateral plantar fasciitis, it may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for service connection for a right knee disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that in addition to the issues of entitlement to service connection for a back disability, CFS, sleep apnea, left foot fallen arch, bilateral plantar fasciitis, and a right knee disability, the Veteran also listed the issues of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a left knee disability, and left and right feet frostbite residuals in his August 2023 VA Form 10182. In another August 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran requested the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD be moved to the Evidence Review docket. As such, this issue is not currently before the Board in the present appeal and will be considered in a separate Board decision. Issues related to entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability and left and right feet frostbite residuals were not addressed in the August 2023 rating decision on appeal. In fact, claims for entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability and left and right feet frostbite residuals were not addressed in a rating decision by the VA AOJ in the one-year period preceding the receipt of the August 2023 VA Form 10182. As such, the issues of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability and left and right feet frostbite residuals are not properly before the Board. 

Service Connection - Back Disability, CFS, Sleep Apnea, Left Foot Fallen Arch, and Bilateral Plantar Fasciitis

I. Law and Regulations

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active military service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

To prevail on a direct service connection claim, there must be competent evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or an injury, and (3) a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Board notes that pain in conjunction with functional impairment of earning capacity can constitute a disability for purposes of service connection. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

A veteran will be considered to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable (obvious or manifest) evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior thereto. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1113; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).

If a preexisting disorder is noted upon entry into service, the veteran cannot bring a claim for service connection for that disorder, but the veteran may bring a claim for service-connected aggravation of that disorder. Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (2004). In that case, 38 U.S.C. § 1153 applies and the burden falls on the veteran to establish an increase in disability during service. If the presumption of aggravation attaches, the burden shifts to the government to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that there has been no increase in the severity of the preexisting condition or that any increase was the result of natural progression. Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

II. Analysis

The Veteran asserts he has a back disability, CFS, sleep apnea, and a left foot fallen arch and bilateral plantar fasciitis, also claimed as a bilateral musculoskeletal foot condition, that had their onset during active service or are otherwise etiologically related to service. Specifically, the Veteran claims his disabilities are due to field duty during his time in Germany and Georgia, exposure to diesel fuel and human waste, road marches, parade duty, ruck sack marches, competing for the Army in numerous track meets, and secondary to right knee and right achilles tendon injuries during service.

Initially, the Board notes that most of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are unavailable. Under such circumstances, VA has a heightened duty to assist the Veteran in the development of the case, and a heightened duty to consider carefully the benefit of the doubt rule. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 369-70 (2005).

Back, CFS, and Sleep Apnea

The Veteran's available STRs and personnel records are silent for any complaints of, treatment for, or diagnosis of any back pain, back conditions, CFS, sleep issues, or sleep apnea. The only available STRs are the Veteran's July 1985 enlistment examination, a post discharge August 1993 reserve physical, and a post discharge May 2003 guard dental examination. The July 1985 enlistment examination notes eye and ear conditions and bilateral mild pes planus, asymptomatic. The August 1993 report of medical history notes eye surgery, occasional sinusitis, and leg cramps described as occasional pulled hamstrings. The May 2003 dental examination noted the Veteran had dental deficiencies, but in the dental patient medical history, the Veteran did not report any currently present medical conditions and described his health as excellent. The Veteran's personnel records reflect the Veteran was stationed in Germany and Georgia during active service, and his evaluations describe him a strong supporter of his unit's athletic program and physically fit to the highest degree. These records also contain certificates of achievement, which reflect the Veteran competed in the German-American partnership field day. 

The Veteran identified his VA treatment records from 2018 to 2023 as medical evidence that supported his claims. While these records reflect the Veteran reported a history of an Achilles tendon rupture and ongoing chronic knee pain, they are silent for any complaint of, treatment for, or diagnosis of any back pain, back condition, CFS, sleep issues, or sleep apnea. In fact, the Veteran's VA treatment records note the Veteran specifically denied these symptoms and conditions. See September 2019 VA emergency room treatment record (denied back pain), October 2019 VA treatment record (denied sleep apnea or CPAP usage), and July 2022 VA treatment record (denied weakness and fatigue). 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's own contentions that his claimed conditions are due to his active service, but the Board finds that the Veteran's lay opinions have less probative weight than the medical evidence of record, which is against finding a medical diagnosis of a back disability, CFS, or sleep apnea. While the Veteran is competent to report symptoms, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis, as that requires medical expertise and is outside the realm of common knowledge of a layperson. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Hence, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has not been afforded VA examinations regarding his claimed back disability, CFS, or sleep apnea. However, there is no indication from the record that the Veteran has any current diagnosis of any back condition, CFS, or sleep apnea, or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability that is related to his active service. As such, the Board finds examinations are not necessary as the requirements for affording the Veteran examinations have not been met. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

In order for a disability to be service connected, it must be present at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of the claim. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013). Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service-connected benefits to cases where there is a current disability. In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992). 

Thus, absent current diagnosis of a back disability, including a finding of functional impairment of earning capacity due to pain, CFS, or sleep apnea, an award of service connection for a back disability, CFS, and sleep apnea is not warranted. See Saunders, 886 F. 3d at 1368; Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67; see also Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225. In reaching this conclusion the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine; however, as the persuasiveness of the evidence is against the claims and is not in approximate balance, that doctrine is not applicable, and the claims must be denied. 38 U.S.C. §5107(b); Lynch, 21 F. 4th at 776.

Left Foot Fallen Arch, Bilateral Plantar Fasciitis, and/or Bilateral Musculoskeletal Foot Condition

As noted above, the Veteran asserts he has a left foot fallen arch, bilateral plantar fasciitis, and/or a musculoskeletal foot disability that had its onset during active service, or is otherwise etiologically related to active service.

As to current disability, the only evidence of record which contains a diagnosis of a musculoskeletal foot disability is the Veteran's July 1985 enlistment examination report, which contains a notation of bilateral mild pes planus, asymptomatic. Thus, the evidence shows that the Veteran's pes planus preexisted his active service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b). Accordingly, the presumption of soundness does not apply, and the Board must determine whether the Veteran's preexisting pes planus underwent a worsening during service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306. 

The Veteran's post discharge August 1993 reserve physical is silent for any complaints of, treatment for, or diagnoses of any foot symptoms or conditions. 

While the Veteran's post discharge treatment records contain a report of a history of a right Achilles tendon repair and evaluation and treatment of skin issues on the Veteran's feet, these records are also silent for any complaints of, treatment for, or diagnosis of any musculoskeletal foot symptoms or conditions. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's statement that his foot pain began in service and has continued since. However, his lay testimony in this regard does not persuasively show that the condition underwent a permanent increase in disability in service. Although the Veteran is competent to report he had foot pain in service, the question of whether there was an actual increase in the disability requires medical expertise. This is so since it relates to an internal medical process which extends beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship that is of the type that the courts have found to be beyond the competence of lay witnesses. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376, n.4. Therefore, the Veteran's statements in this regard are not considered probative evidence. This is especially so when considering that intermittent or temporary flare-ups during service of a preexisting injury or disease do not constitute aggravation; rather, the underlying condition, as contrasted with symptoms, must have worsened. Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 297 (1991). Additionally, the Veteran has not been shown to have the medical expertise to diagnose any other foot disability and his opinion as to the existence of any other foot disabilities or as to the etiology of such is not competent medical evidence. Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination regarding his claims. However, there is no indication from the record that the Veteran's preexisting pes planus underwent a worsening in service or that the Veteran has any other current foot disabilities or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability that are related to his active service. As such, the Board finds an examination is not necessary as the requirements for affording the Veteran an examination have not been met. See McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79.

In order for a disability to be service connected, it must be present at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of the claim. McClain, 21 Vet. App. 319; Romanowsky, 26 Vet. App. 289. Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service-connected benefits to cases where there is a current disability. In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer, 3 Vet. App. 223. 

In consideration of the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran has not met his burden of showing that his pes planus underwent an increase in disability during service.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's pes planus was noted on entry to service, and the evidence of record does not persuasively show an increase in the severity during service. Thus, the presumption of aggravation does not attach, and consequently, a discussion of clear and unmistakable evidence to rebut the presumption of aggravation is not required. Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096. Because the Veteran's preexisting pes planus was not aggravated by military service and there is no confirmed current diagnosis of any other foot disabilities, entitlement to service connection for a left foot fallen arch and bilateral plantar fasciitis, also claimed as a musculoskeletal foot condition, must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service Connection - Right Knee Disability 

The Veteran asserts he has a right knee disability that had its onset during active service or is otherwise etiologically related to active service. As noted above, the Veteran claims he injured his right knee during service due to road marches, parade duty, ruck sack marches, and competing for the Army in numerous track meets.

While the available STRs are silent for any complaint of, treatment for, or diagnosis of any right knee condition, the records do reflect the Veteran participated in physical training, unit athletic events, and competed in a German-American field day.

Post discharge VA treatment records reflect the Veteran reported he had been running for the United States track and field team for 30 years and had injured his right knee during training. See August 2019 VA treatment record. However, an April 2021 VA orthopedic surgery record reflects the Veteran reported he had experienced right knee pain since the 1980s, and the pain had been on and off over the years with periods of increased pain usually when running or walking on uneven ground or when squatting. The provider noted the MRI revealed a complex degenerative medial meniscus tear involving the posterior horn and body, but there were no mechanical symptoms and no significant pain. 

While there is evidence that indicates the Veteran's claimed right knee disability may be etiologically related to the Veteran's active service, the evidence of record is insufficient to determine if the Veteran's claimed right knee disability had its onset during active service or is etiologically related to the Veteran's service. Further, the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination in response to his claim of entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability.

In light of evidence indicating a potential relationship to service and the heightened duty to assist due to unavailable STRs, the Board finds that the failure to afford the Veteran a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of any currently present right knee disability constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error on the part of the AOJ. Accordingly, the Veteran should be afforded a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of any currently present right knee disability. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the nature and etiology of the claimed right knee disability. The claims file must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner. Any indicated tests and studies must be performed.

Based on the examination results and review of the record, the examiner must provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the claimed right knee disability had its onset during the Veteran's active service or is otherwise etiologically related to service. In forming the opinion, the examiner must consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset and continuity of his symptoms. 

A complete and detailed rationale must be provided for all opinions expressed.
