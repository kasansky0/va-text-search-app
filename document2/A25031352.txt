ORDER

Entitlement to an increased rating greater than 10 percent for right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy from August 7, 2023, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy symptomatology does not more nearly approximate moderate incomplete paralysis the entire period on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an increased rating greater than 10 percent for right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy from August 7, 2023, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.123, 4.124, 4.124a, diagnostic code (DC) 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1990 to June 1993.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO).  

In a March 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Preliminary Matters

The Board notes that within the March 2024 VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement, the Veteran noted he was appealing the January 2024 rating decision but identified several other issues aside from the right lower extremity issue here. Nonetheless, the Board finds that the record contains only one January 2024 rating decision, and that decision only decided the single issue on appeal here.  

Although the Board reads submissions liberally, the procedural history here is unambiguous as the sole issue decided within the January 2024 rating decision was one pertaining to the right lower extremity radiculopathy rating. 

It is further worth noting that the other issues mentioned within the VA Form 10182 likely pertained to prior rating decisions and, since that time, have already been decided by the Board in separate rating decisions.  As such, the issue herein will be limited solely to the matter decided within the January 2024 rating decision. 

INCREASED RATING

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  

If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.  

In deciding this appeal, the Board has considered whether separate ratings for different periods of time, based on the facts found, are warranted, a practice of assigning ratings referred to as "staged" ratings.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2008).

When an unlisted condition is encountered it will be permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous.  38 C.F.R. § 4.20.

When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

Entitlement to an increased rating greater than 10 percent for right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy from August 7, 2023, is denied.

The Veteran's right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy is currently rated 10 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520.  

By way of background, the AOJ granted service connection for right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy in an April 2023 rating decision, evaluating it as 10 percent disabling from January 9, 2023. The Veteran filed a claim for a higher rating August 7, 2023, but the 10 percent rating was continued in a January 2024 rating decision.  

The Board finds the period on appeal stems from the Veteran's August 7, 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ and that there was not continuous pursuit from the January 9, 2023, original grant of service connection. While the Court has held that forms are not dispositive, they are also not irrelevant and here there is no reason to doubt the Veteran's intent was to file a new claim of worsening rather than disagree with the initial rating of his disability. See Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024); but see Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, ___ Vet. App. __ (2025). 

As such, the Board will consider whether an increased rating is warranted during the relevant period on appeal, to include the year preceding the date of the claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). As will be outlined below, the Board finds no such increase warranted here.

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.  (Neuritis and neuralgia of that group are evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 8620 and 8720.).  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling.  Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a.  

As with any regulatory interpretation where the terms are not defined in the regulation, the Board presumes such terms carry their ordinary dictionary meaning. See Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 336 (2018); see also Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2415 (2019) (finding the plain dictionary meaning of a word may be used where it is unambiguous). 

According to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 999 (11th Ed. 2007), "mild" means gentle in nature or temperate.  "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect or average in amount, intensity, quality, or degree.  The term "moderately severe" includes impairment that is considered more than "moderate" but not to the extent as to be considered "severe."  Webster's New World Dictionary (2nd ed. 1999), 1012.  "Severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree. "Considerable" is defined as "large in extent or degree."  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267 (11th ed. 2012).  Although a medical examiner's use of descriptive terminology such as "mild" is an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, it is not dispositive of an issue.  The Board must evaluate all evidence in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating.  38?C.F.R. §§?4.2, 4.6. 

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

Further, for all neurological conditions, due consideration must be given as to whether not only the underlying DC may provide for an increased rating, but whether the neuritis and/or neuralgia diagnostic codes can provide for a separate rating for "nerve pain" where applicable and where pyramiding is not otherwise violated.  See Banschbach v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 422 (2024).  The Board will consider those diagnostic codes (DC 8630, DC 8730) to the extent the evidence so provides.

Turning to the relevant evidence of record, VA outpatient treatment records generally show a history of the Veteran's lumbar radiculopathy with complaints of back pain radiating down the right leg. See, e.g., February 2020, March 2020, February 2021 VA outpatient treatment records. 

A February 2023 disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) indicates that the sensory examination reflects decreased sensation to light touch in the right thigh/knee.  Straight leg raising testing was negative and there was mild intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness of the right lower extremity with the examining nurse practitioner (NP) noting involvement of the right sciatic nerves.  The Veteran reported that the current symptoms included needling numbness and burning sensation down the lateral aspect of the right thigh that was intermittent, but when present lasts 1 to 2 weeks.  He stated that the sensation occurs at least once a month with onset that usually coincides with a gout attack.  He treated his symptoms with Aleve, heating pads, ice, and rest in a recliner.  The NP also noted a small strip of decreased sensation on distal lateral thigh.

A September 2023 DBQ indicates that the Veteran does not have radicular pain or any other signs or symptoms due to radiculopathy and the sensory examination  is normal for the right lower extremity.

In a December 2023 DBQ, the physician assistant (PA) noted a diagnosis of right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy from July 2021 and the Veteran's report of symptoms of a burning feeling, pain, and "needle-like feeling" which impairs his sleep and ability to perform certain duties.  The Veteran stated that the condition began "years ago" with a gradual onset, but that he has not been treated for the condition stating that he is currently taking no medication.  The PA noted moderate right lower extremity intermittent pain and numbness, and mild right lower extremity paresthesias and/or dysesthesias.  The sensory examination reflected decreased sensation to light touch in the right upper anterior thigh, and thigh/knee, but no trophic changes and the Veteran's gait was slowed due to gout and knee pain.  The PA reported mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve and indicated that the peripheral neuropathy condition impacts the Veteran's ability to work as the symptoms can wake the Veteran at night causing daytime fatigue, reducing productivity at work.

Analysis 

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that a rating higher than 10 percent for the Veteran's right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy is not warranted.  

In so concluding, the Board considered the entirety of the Veteran's disability picture, to include his own described reported symptoms, the frequency, duration and duration of those symptoms and the objective findings throughout the period on appeal.

In that regard, the Veteran has described his symptoms to be relatively infrequent using the word "intermittent" but also noting they only occurred "once a month," to include intermittent burning feeling, pain and a needlelike feeling.  He also noted they would last 1 to 2 weeks. 

The examiners of record largely described the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy findings as "mild" in severity as well as noting the Veteran's report of infrequent and intermittent symptoms.  The February 2023 and December 2023 examiners each described the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve as primarily mild in severity, with the February 2023 NP noting mild right lower extremity intermittent pain, numbness, and paresthesias and/or dysesthesias.  

The Board acknowledges that the December 2023 PA noted moderate right lower extremity intermittent pain and numbness, but nonetheless the PA described the Veteran's overall disability as "mild" indicating he had mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias.

While the examiners noted the findings of pain, numbness and paresthesias, the examiners found, on the other hand, the Veteran did not experience any trophic changes, muscle atrophy, or abnormal reflexes attributed to his right lower extremity radiculopathy. 

Importantly, the Veteran did have a slowed gait/abnormal gait, but such findings were attributed to other service-connected disabilities, notable the Veteran's gout and knee pain.

The persuasive weight of the evidence does not support the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy causes more than over mild incomplete paralysis manifestations, as outlined above, in consideration of both the objective evidence and the Veteran's lay description indicating intermittent and infrequent complaints of pain, tingling, pain, numbness, and loss of sensation, but with largely no findings of muscle atrophy, abnormal reflexes, or trophic changes.  Also important, the examiners and the lay statements of record do not support complete paralysis symptomatology. 

The Board acknowledges that VA is required "to discount beneficial medication effects when relevant rating criteria do not specifically contemplate medication use," Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025). 

Here, at the time of the February and December 2023 VA examinations, the Veteran was not taking medication to treat his disability.  As such, the Board finds it reasonable to infer that there are no beneficial effects of medication in which to discount. Nonetheless, the Board has considered the Veteran's description of manifestations resolving all reasonable doubt in his3 favor.

The Board considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected.  The current rating already contemplates pain, and, therefore, a separate rating for neuralgia or neuritis would be pyramiding. See Banschbach, 37 Vet. App. 422. Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.

The Board also finds the Veteran's disability is fully capable of evaluation under the rating schedule.

As the persuasive weight of the evidence does not more nearly approximate more than a "mild" incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve of the right lower extremity, the Board finds a rating greater than 10 percent is not warranted here. The appeal is, therefore, denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
