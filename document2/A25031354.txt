DOCKET NO. 240627-450811
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On December 31, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from July 1988 to July 1992.  For his service, he was awarded the Rifle Marksman Badge, Pistol Sharpshooter Badge, Certificate of Appreciation, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (with 1 star), National Defense Service Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal (with 1 star), Meritorious Mast, Good Conduct Medal, Letter of Appreciation (2nd Award), Kuwait Liberation Medal, and Humanitarian Service Medal.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a rating decision issued in July 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act.  In June 2024, the Veteran filed a timely Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) for the July 2023 rating decision-which denied entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea-and requested the Direct Review docket.

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  A substantive appeal may be withdrawn in writing at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or his authorized representative.  Id.  For withdrawals not made on the record at a Board hearing, such must be made in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  Id.  If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  Id.; see also Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2020).

Following the submission of his June 2024 VA Form 10182, for the issue of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, the Veteran submitted a statement in which he indicated that he wished to "knowingly and voluntarily withdraw [his] claims at the Board, including obstructive sleep apnea."  In this regard, such statement was in writing, was authored by the Veteran, included the correct file number, and identified that all issues-including obstructive sleep apnea-were to be withdrawn.  Therefore, as he has withdrawn his appeal as to the issue in the instant case, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
