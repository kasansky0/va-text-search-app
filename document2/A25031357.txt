ORDER

For the entire period on appeal, entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected status post inguinal hernia repair is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's status post inguinal hernia repair has been manifested by reports of pain, but no recommendation for future surgery, no finding of any hernia protrusion, weakness in abdominal muscles, or indication for support belt or truss and met or more nearly approximated an inguinal hernia that is small, reducible, or without true hernia protrusion.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable rating for service-connected status post inguinal hernia repair have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7338.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2008 to January 2012.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2021 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the June 2022 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's December 2021 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the December 2021 rating decision, unfortunately, the Board could not consider it in making its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801.

If the Veteran would like the VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, the VA will issue another decision on the claim; considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule). 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability ratings. See generally, 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995). Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, when the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial disability rating assigned, evaluation of the medical evidence since the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of "staged rating" is required. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

Staged ratings are also appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would meet or more nearly approximate different ratings. The relevant focus for adjudicating an increased rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). As such, the relevant evidentiary period for this increased rating claim includes the one-year look-back period prior to the Veteran's January 29, 2021, increased rating claim (i.e., January 29, 2020), onwards. See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (referencing the "'one-year look-back period'"). Therefore, the Board may only consider evidence of record dating from January 29, 2020, onwards.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

When all the evidence is assembled, the VA is responsible for determining whether the weight of the evidence is in approximate balance. If the positive and negative evidence is evenly or approximately balanced, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

For the entire period on appeal, entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected status post inguinal hernia repair.

The Veteran is service connected for his status post inguinal hernia repair, which is currently rated noncompensable. The Veteran filed a January 2021 claim for increase rating for service-connected status post inguinal hernia repair disability.  See January 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ. He contends that a higher rating is warranted. See June 2022 VA Form 10182.

The Veteran's status post inguinal hernia repair has been assigned a noncompensable rating under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 7338.

The Board notes that the regulations concerning the digestive system were updated effective May 19, 2024. Since these revisions became effective on May 19, 2024, the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement was filed in June 2022, and the rating decision on appeal was from December 2021, the criteria prior to May 19, 2024, are applicable.

As such, under the pre-amended DC 7338, a noncompensable rating is warranted for an inguinal hernia that is small, reducible, or without true hernia protrusion. A noncompensable rating is also warranted for a hernia that is not operated but remediable. A 10 percent rating is assigned for a postoperative recurrent hernia, readily reducible and well supported by truss or belt. A 30 percent rating is assigned for a small, postoperative recurrent, or unoperated irremediable hernia, not well supported by truss, or not readily reducible. A 60 percent rating is afforded for a large, postoperative, recurrent, not well supported hernia under ordinary conditions and not readily reducible, when considered inoperable. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7338.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his hernia condition in July 2021. The Veteran reported a left inguinal hernia in 2009 for which he had surgery and indicated that since 2012 he continues to have residual occasional sharp pain, with irritation, especially when having sex or performing a thrusting movement with occasional tearing sensation and numbness/tingling and burning sensation. See July 2021 Hernias (Including Abdominal, Inguinal and Femoral Hernias) Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). On physical examination, however, the examiner found that there was no hernia detected, a small scar but no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms related to the Veteran's status post left inguinal hernia repair. Id. The examiner also found no indication of support on the left and no ventral hernia was detected. Id.

The Board has also carefully reviewed the Veteran's treatment notes and finds that there is nothing to contradict the July 2021 VA examiner's findings. The Veteran has not identified any other evidence that would support a higher rating for his status post inguinal hernia repair. Ultimately, the Board finds no such evidence in the record, including in prior VA examinations or medical records.

Whether a disability meets the schedular criteria for the assignment of a higher evaluation is a factual determination based on the Veteran's complaints coupled with the medical evidence. Unfortunately, the record does not support of a higher rating in this case. Although the Veteran may believe he meets the criteria for a higher disability rating, the Board finds that, unfortunately, his complaints of pain along with the medical findings do not meet the schedular requirements for a higher evaluation, as explained above.

The Board has also considered whether a higher or separate evaluation may be assigned under any other potentially applicable criteria. However, there is no other basis to award a separate or higher evaluation. More specifically, the Veteran reports a scar which can be evaluated under DCs 7800-04. Inapplicable to this case is DC 7800 which rates burn scar(s) of the head, face, or neck; scar(s) of the head, face, or neck due to other causes; or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck and DC 7801 which rates burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage. The Veteran's scar is not of the head, face, or neck nor is the scar associated with underlying soft tissue damage.

Under DC 7802 for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, a 10 percent rating is warranted for area or areas of 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or greater. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 7802. The Veteran's scar is reported to be 7cm x 0.5cm; thus, not warranting a compensable rating under this DC. See July 2021 Hernias (Including Abdominal, Inguinal and Femoral Hernias) DBQ.

Under DC 7804 for scar(s), unstable or painful, a 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two scars that are unstable or painful. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 7802. The Veteran's scar is not reported to be unstable or painful; thus, not warranting a compensable rating under this DC. See July 2021 Hernias (Including Abdominal, Inguinal and Femoral Hernias) DBQ.

The Board accepts that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms. However, whether a disability meets the schedular criteria for the assignment of a higher evaluation is a factual determination by the Board based on the Veteran's complaints coupled with the medical evidence. Although the Veteran may believe that he meets the criteria for the next higher disability rating, his complaints along with the medical findings, unfortunately, do not meet the schedular requirements for a higher evaluation than now assigned, as explained and discussed above.

Given the above, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for status post inguinal hernia repair. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board has also considered whether a staged rating is appropriate, per Fenderson, and finds a staged rating inapplicable to the present facts. Throughout the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's status post inguinal hernia repair has been manifested by reports of pain, but no recommendation for future surgery, no finding of any hernia protrusion, weakness in abdominal muscles, or indication for support belt or truss and met or more nearly approximated an inguinal hernia that is small, reducible, or without true hernia protrusion. However, at no time during the period on appeal did the Veteran's status post inguinal hernia repair symptoms meet or more nearly approximate a postoperative recurrent hernia, readily reducible and well supported by truss or belt, as required for a compensable rating under DC 7338.
