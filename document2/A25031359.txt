DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of January 21, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for loss of use of both lower extremities is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of January 21, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of special monthly compensation (SMC) based on loss of use of both lower extremities and for the rate intermediate between subsection (m) and subsection (n) on account of entitlement to the rate equal to subsection (m) with additional disability, Parkinson's Disease with urinary problems independently ratable at 50 percent or more is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 17, 2022 for the grant of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance with the need of a higher level of care is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the period prior to January 21, 2022 the evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran's Parkinson's disease caused loss of use of one or both lower extremities.

2. For the period from January 21, 2022, the evidence is at least in relative equipoise that the Veteran's Parkinson's disease caused loss of use of both lower extremities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date from January 21, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for loss of use of both lower extremities have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 5107, 5110, 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date from January 21, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant SMC based on loss of use of both lower extremities and for the rate intermediate between subsection (m) and subsection (n) on account of entitlement to the rate equal to subsection (m) with additional disability, Parkinson's Disease with urinary problems independently ratable at 50 percent or more have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 5104C, 5107, 5110, 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.156, 3.350, 3.351, 3.352, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1987 to March 1992.  He served honorably in the U.S. Air Force, including foreign service.  The Board thanks the Veteran for his service to our country.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes a higher level review decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

By way of background, the Veteran submitted an intent to file on May 26, 2021, and submitted a claim in June 2021 for Parkinson's disease.  Following a September 2021 rating decision denying service connection, on August 17, 2022, the Veteran appealed the rating decision to the Board; he also submitted an intent to file on the same day.  The Board granted service connection for Parkinsonism in a May 2023 decision and in a June 2023 implementing decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for Parkinson's disease with urinary problems and assigned a 60 percent rating from May 26, 2021; it also granted service connection for various manifestations of Parkinson's, including left and right lower extremity balance impairment, bradykinesia, tremor, and muscle rigidity, assigning 30 percent ratings effective May 26, 2021.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the issues of Parkinson's disease and left and right lower extremity balance impairment, bradykinesia, tremor, and muscle rigidity most recently addressed in the June 2023 rating decision; specifically, the Veteran contended that SMC at the (r) rate was warranted.  

In a September 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for loss of use of both lower extremities secondary to service connected Parkinson's disease with urinary problems; it also granted entitlement to SMC based on loss of use of both lower extremities; entitlement to a rate intermediate between subsection (m) and subsection (n); and SMC based on aid and attendance with the need of a higher level of care. The grants were effective from August 17, 2022.

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the September 2023 decision, specifically, the effective date of the awards.  In October 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2023 decision.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim for an earlier effective date for the grant of SMC at the (r) rating, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

In a June 2024 motion, the Veteran's attorney moved to advance the claim on the docket as the Veteran was on hospice care.  Advancement on the docket is granted.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 17, 2022 for service connection for loss of use of both lower extremities

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 17, 2022 for the grant of SMC based on loss of use of both lower extremities and for the rate intermediate between subsection (m) and subsection (n) on account of entitlement to the rate equal to subsection (m) with additional disability, Parkinson's Disease with urinary problems independently ratable at 50 percent or more

The Veteran contends, through his attorney, that the Veteran continuously pursued his claim and that an effective date of May 26, 2021, the date of receipt of the intent to file, is warranted.  The Board concludes that an effective date of January 21, 2022, but no earlier, is warranted for the grants of service connection for loss of use of both lower extremities and the grants of SMC at the (m), (o), and (p) rates.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  If an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the proper effective date is the date that the increase is shown to have occurred or be factually ascertainable.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

If a determination by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) is not timely appealed, that determination becomes final.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d), 19.52, 20.1103.  Previous determinations which are final and binding, including decisions of service connection and degree of disability, will be accepted as correct in the absence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).  For any award based on a new claim or evidence received after a final disallowance, the effective date of that award will be the date of receipt of the new claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2).

Service connection for loss of use of both lower extremities was granted and rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5110.  "Loss of use of both lower extremities" and "loss of use of both feet" are not defined under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5110.  However, the term "loss of use of a hand or foot" is defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a)(2)(i) as existing when "no effective function remains other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation stump at the site of election below the elbow or knee with the use of a suitable prosthetic appliance."  The determination will be made based on the actual remaining function whether, in the case of the foot, the acts of balance, propulsion, etc., could be accomplished equally well by an amputation stump with prosthesis.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a)(2)(i).

SMC at the (m) rate is warranted if, as the result of service-connected disability, a veteran has: (1) anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands; (2) anatomical loss or loss of use of both legs at a level, or with complications, preventing natural knee action with prosthesis in place; (3) anatomical loss or loss of use of one arm and of one leg at a level, or with complications, preventing natural elbow and knee action with prosthesis in place; (4) blindness in both eyes having only light perception; or (5) blindness in both eyes which results in being so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(m); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(c).

In determining whether there is natural knee action with prosthesis in place, consideration will be based on whether use of the proper prosthetic appliance requires natural use of the joint, or whether necessary motion is otherwise controlled, so that the muscles affecting joint motion, if not already atrophied, will become so.

SMC at the (o) rate is warranted if, as the result of service-connected disability, a veteran has: (1) anatomical loss of both arms so near the shoulder as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance; (2) disabilities entitling two or more of the rates (l) through (n), with no disability being considered twice; (3) bilateral deafness rated at 60 percent or more (when the hearing impairment in either one or both ears is service-connected) in combination with service-connected blindness with bilateral visual acuity 20/200 or less; or (4) service-connected total deafness in one ear or bilateral deafness rated at 40 percent or more (when the hearing impairment in either one or both ears is service-connected) in combination with service-connected blindness of both eyes having only light perception or less.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(o); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(e)(1).

Additionally, through the combination of loss of use of both legs and helplessness, paralysis of both lower extremities together with loss of anal and bladder sphincter control warrants SMC at the maximum (o) rate.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(e)(2).  SMC at the maximum (o) rate is also warrants for loss of use of two extremities combined with helplessness, to include from absolute deafness and nearly total blindness and from very severe multiple injuries producing total disability outside of useless extremities.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(e)(4).  Determinations must be based upon separate and distinct disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(e)(3).

SMC (p) bumps up the rate assigned under other provisions in half step or whole step increments.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (p); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f).  Bump-ups in excess of the (l) rate, but in no event higher than the (o) rate, are assigned for the various combinations involving loss or loss of use of the feet, legs, arms, and/or hands, as well as for various combinations involving blindness and deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)(1-2).  Further, additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 50 percent or more warrants the assignment of the next highest half step rate.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)(3).  In no event can the rate be higher than (o), however.  Similarly, additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 100 percent without consideration of total disability based on individual unemployability warrants the assignment of the next highest whole step rate.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)(4).  In no event can the rate be higher than (o), however.  The additional disability or disabilities must be separate and distinct as well as involve different anatomical segments or bodily systems from those used to achieve SMC at the (l) through (n) rate or a half step rate.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)(3-4). Finally, the next highest half step or whole step rate is assigned for anatomical loss or loss of use, or a combination of anatomical loss and loss of use, of three extremities.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)(5).

In this case, the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim and the period on appeal starts on May 26, 2021.

Prior to the period on appeal, in a March 2021 treatment record, a private provider noted that the Veteran kept busy with walks and got exercise.  In an April 2021 physical therapy evaluation note, the Veteran reported foot pain with standing and walking.

During the period on appeal, in a May 2021 note, Dr. J.M., the Veteran's treating neurologist, noted that the Veteran's gait was mildly stooped and that he had a mild shuffle.

In an August 2022 letter, Dr. J.M. noted that the course of the Veteran's disability had been "relentlessly progressive" and that he was totally disabled.  

In an April 2023 statement, the Veteran's spouse stated that his physical and mental condition continued to rapidly deteriorate since the onset of the disability and that he began having problems with physical activities due to poor balance and muscle control.  She noted that he was referred to palliative care in 2022 and that his condition continued to significantly deteriorate, resulting in difficulties walking and talking, incontinence, and inability to dress, bathe, or feed himself.  She relayed that in March 2023 he was moved to hospice care due to his severe decline in condition.

In a May 2023 Parkinson's disease disability benefits questionnaire, the Veteran's providing hospice nurse, K.C., noted severe stooped posture, balance impairment, and bradykinesia as well as severe bilateral lower extremity tremor and muscle rigidity and stiffness.  K.C. noted that he was dependent for activities of daily living and required assistance for ambulation.

In a June 2023 examination, the Veteran's providing hospice physician, E.de L., noted that the Veteran had unsteady gait, tremors, stiffness, increased weakness, poor balance, and required assistance with ambulation.

In August 2023 treatment notes, the Veteran's caregiver reported that the Veteran could not walk without her holding him up and even then would just stop and fall forward.

In an August 2023 letter, Dr. J.M. stated that, with respect to balance and propulsion, the remaining function of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremities was equal to amputation with prosthesis in place.  Dr. J.M. stated that his Parkinson's disease manifested in stooped posture, lower extremity tremors, and extremely poor balance, rendering him unable to walk.  Dr. J.M. stated that the Veteran's inability to walk began after a fall on January 21, 2022.  The Board finds this opinion probative as Dr. J.M. is the Veteran's treating neurologist and has knowledge of the progression of his disability.

In light of the above, read in the light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board concludes that the evidence is at least in relative equipoise that grant of service connection for loss of use of the lower extremities is warranted from January 21, 2022.  Dr. J.M. concluded the Veteran had stooped posture, lower extremity tremors, and extremely poor balance which rendered him unable to walk from January 21, 2022 and that this was equal to amputation with prosthesis in place.  There is no evidence against an effective date of January 21, 2022.  

However, the evidence is persuasively against the grant of service connection for loss of use of the lower extremities prior to January 21, 2022.  Shortly before the period on appeal, the Veteran was noted to stay busy with walks and was noted to stand and walk.  In May 2021, during the period on appeal, Dr. J.M. noted that his posture was mildly stooped and that he had a mild shuffle.  Furthermore, Dr. J.M. identified the January 21, 2022 fall as the onset of his stooped posture, lower extremity tremors, and extremely poor balance which rendered him unable to walk.

Additionally, read in the light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board further concludes that the evidence is at least in relative equipoise that grants of service connection for loss of use of the lower extremities and for SMC at the (m), (o), and (p) rates are warranted from January 21, 2022.  Dr. J.M. concluded that the Veteran lost the ability to walk due to lower extremity tremors and extremely poor balance from January 21, 2022.  The Veteran has severe injuries producing total disability (apart from his lower extremities) and Parkinson's disease ratable at 50 percent or more effective May 26, 2021.  However, for the reasons identified above, the evidence is persuasively against the grant of SMC at the (m), (o), and (p) rates prior to January 21, 2022.

Accordingly, entitlement to a January 21, 2022 effective date for the grants of service connection for loss of use of both lower extremities and for SMC at the (m), (o), and (p) rates is warranted.  Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 21, 2022 for these grants is not warranted as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 17, 2022 for the grant of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance with the need of a higher level of care is remanded.

A remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

SMC at the (r) rate concerns special aid and attendance.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(r); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(h).  It is an additional allowance available when not hospitalized at government expense.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(h).  To qualify under the (r)(1) or the (r)(2) rate, receipt of the (o) rate, the maximum rate under (p), or an intermediate rate between the (n) and (o) rates plus a (k) rate is required.  The need for regular aid and attendance is also required to qualify under the (r)(1) and (r)(2) rates.  SMC at the (r)(2) rate is warranted when, as a result of a service-connected disability, a veteran otherwise entitled to SMC at the (l) rate needs in-home personal health-care services provided by either 1) a person who is licensed to provide such services, or 2) a person who provides such services under the regular supervision of a licensed health-care professional.

In this case, while entitlement to SMC at the (o) rate is warranted as of January 21, 2022, as granted herein, a grant of an earlier effective date for SMC at the (r) rate cannot be made as the Board cannot determine based on the evidence of record an earlier factually ascertainable date on which the Veteran needed in-home personal health-care services provided by either 1) a person who is licensed to provide such services, or 2) a person who provides such services under the regular supervision of a licensed health-care professional.

However, a remand is necessary as there is evidence of treatment, including treatment from Dr. J.M. and receipt of palliative care and hospice care, for the Veteran's Parkinson's disease and its manifestations but there is no evidence of record of any attempt to associate these private treatment records with the record.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Please attempt to secure for the record copies of complete updated clinical records (any not already of record) of non-VA treatment the Veteran has received for his Parkinson's disease and its manifestations.  Please ask the Veteran or his power of attorney to provide the releases necessary for VA to secure private treatment records for his Parkinson's disease and its manifestations, to include treatment from his neurologist Dr. J.M. and 

?

any in-home palliative care or hospice care records.  Please note the Veteran has a terminal illness and expedition is appreciated.
