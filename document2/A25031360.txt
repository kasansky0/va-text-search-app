ISSUE

Entitlement to service connection for depression, to include adjustment disorder with depressed mood ("depression").

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for depression is DENIED.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's depression has not been shown to be caused by an event, injury, or illness during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for depression has not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from December 2013 to December 2017.

On February 8, 2022, the Veteran filed a disability claim for depression with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  On April 13, 2022, the VA Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision denying the claim.

On February 9, 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental disability claim for depression with the VA.  On May 6, 2023, the RO issued a rating decision finding new and relevant evidence and denied the claim.

On April 4, 2024, the Veteran appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request.  In the November 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDING AND CONCLUSION

Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this Decision, there is no requirement that every piece of evidence submitted by the Veteran or obtained on his behalf be discussed in detail.  Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  Gonzales v. West,?218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81?(Fed. Cir. 2000); Timberlake v. Gober,?14 Vet. App. 122, 128-130?(2000). 

Service Connection 

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Service connection can be established on a presumptive, direct, or secondary basis.  This case concerns the second of the three theories of relief.  The three-element test for direct service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1153(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d. 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, some medical issues fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  

Analysis - Depression

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for depression.  See April 2024, VA Form 10182.

The Veteran has met the first element to establish service connection for depression.  Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1163.  VA treatment records show the Veteran has a depression diagnosis.  The May 2023 Rating Decision made the following favorable finding: VA treatment records, Saginaw VA Healthcare System, entry dated April 28, 2023, show an assessment of unspecified depressive disorder.

The second element needed to establish service connection, is to establish an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury.  Id.    

Service treatment records (STRs) were reviewed.  On May 13, 2014, July 18, 2014, and April 21, 2017, the Veteran was seen by a VA treatment provider and had a negative depression screen.  Additionally, the provider noted the Veteran had no anxiety, depression, suicidal or homicidal thoughts.  See August 2020, STR.  On November 29, 2017, prior to the Veteran's separation from service, the Veteran filled out a report of medical history.  The Veteran answered as follows to the question of 'have you ever had, or do you now have': nervous trouble of any sort (no); frequent trouble sleeping (no); depression or excessive worry (no); evaluated or treated for a mental condition (no); attempted suicide (no).  Id.  

On February 2, 2017, the Veteran was diagnosed with insomnia and given medication for sleep.  The Veteran reported that it takes 25-60 minutes to fall asleep and he has nighttime awakenings 3-5 times per night lasting 15-20 minutes each.  The Veteran denied racing or stressful thoughts and did not report any nightmares.  The provider did not find the Veteran showed symptoms of anxiety, emotional lability, depression, decreased functioning ability, was thinking about suicide, or had homicidal thoughts.  

On March 6, 2017, the Veteran was seen for a sleep study follow up, where the provider discussed setting a bedtime and an awakening time, a single time, and to continue this on the weekends as well.  Again, the provider did not have find the Veteran showed symptoms of anxiety, emotional lability, depression, decreased functioning ability, was thinking about suicide, or had homicidal thoughts.         

The Veteran's VA treatment records were reviewed.  On October 12, 2021, the Veteran called the VA to speak to a mental health provider.  The Veteran stated he "noticed that he has been feeling increased depression since a car accident in summer of 2020."  See January 2022, CAPRI.  He requested getting some support to help with his mood and low motivation.  On October 19, 2021, the Veteran completed an initial assessment.  The Veteran was given a provisional diagnosis of depression, and his psychosocial factors were listed as: car accident June 2020, recent return to work, marital and familial stress.  The Veteran had multiple mental health consultation follow up appointments.

On January 6, 2022, the Veteran completed a mental health assessment with his VA provider.  The Veteran reported having a lot of issues in his day-to-day life and enjoyment; he has a dullness and numbness in his life.  The Veteran reported the following stressors:  issues with his mom, dad and wife, loss of both grandfathers, a close friend who took his own life 3 years ago, and a good friend from high school who overdosed in his apartment in Arizona last year.  A provisional diagnosis of depression was continued.  The Veteran continued to have mental health consultation follow up appointments.

On February 8, 2022, the Veteran filed for service connection for depression.  The Veteran stated it was due to "exposure to suicides committed by close friends that I had grown close to."  See February 2022, VA Form 21-526.

On March 31, 2022, the Veteran was seen for a VA examination.  At that examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with depressed mood.  The examiner found the Veteran had occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by medication.  The examiner found the Veteran had symptoms of depressed mood and anxiety.  

The VA examiner did not find the Veteran's depression was due to service.  The examiner found the Veteran's depression was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event or illness.  Specifically, that the "clinical interview, symptom analysis, C-file review, and history are consistent with DSM-5 diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood.  Diagnosis related to psychosocial stressors, namely: 1) marital stress 2) family of origin/ parental stress 3) job issues."  See March 2022, C&P Exam.  

The Board finds the March 2022 VA examination to be of great probative value as it is supported by the evidence of record and a thorough, well-reasoned rationale.  The examination was based on a thorough evaluation of the Veteran's reported history, symptoms, and VA treatment records.  Additionally, the examination was consistent with the Veteran's records and lay evidence of his depression symptomatology.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  

Although the Veteran's STRs show treatment for insomnia while in service, nothing in the record connects the Veteran's insomnia to depression.  The provider who treated the Veteran for insomnia specifically found the Veteran did not have symptoms of anxiety, emotional lability, depression, decreased functioning ability, was thinking about suicide, or had homicidal thoughts.   The Veteran had no complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for depression during service.

After careful review of the evidence of record, the Board finds the evidence does not show an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury to establish service connection for depression.  As the Veteran has not met the second element to establish service connection, this ends the Board analysis.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the probative evidence is persuasively against the Veterans claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and entitlement to depression must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
