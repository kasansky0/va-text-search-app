DOCKET NO. 211118-199530
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

1. In October 2018, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus under the legacy appeal system.

2. In July 2020, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) of the October 2018 rating decision; the Veteran did not submit a timely substantive appeal to the Board and the October 2018 rating decision became final. 

3. On November 18, 2021, the Veteran submitted an improper and untimely appeal to the Board via a VA Form 10182 requesting review of the claim for diabetes mellitus stemming from the October 2018 legacy rating decision. 

4. The Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus was improperly docketed at the Board under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) under Docket 211118-199530.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156, 3.2500, 20.200, 20.202, 20.302, 20.303, 20.1103.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1985 to September 1988.

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus is dismissed.

This Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) appeal is an improperly docketed appeal stream for an issue stemming from an October 2018 legacy rating decision. 

Procedural History 

By way of history, the Veteran sought entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus in August 2018. See August 2018 VA Form 21-526b. In an October 2018 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claim. See October 2018 Rating Decision. On July 21, 2020, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) appealing the October 2018 rating decision. See July 2020 NOD. On July 31, 2020, the Veteran was notified by VA letter that his NOD was untimely and his appeal could not be accepted. See July 2020 Appeal Notification Letter. The VA letter provided information on how to properly file an appeal. Id., at 4. In June 2021, the Veteran filed a new claim for entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus. See June 2021 VA 21-526EZ. On July 31, 2020, the Veteran was notified by VA letter that his application was improper as his claim for diabetes mellitus was previously denied. See June 2021 Correspondence. The VA letter provided information on how to properly file an appeal. Id., at 1-2. In November 2021, the Veteran filed another notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182) appealing the October 2018 legacy rating decision. See November 2021 VA Form 10182. 

Analysis

In August 2017, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), was signed into law. This law created a new framework for veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review and became effective February 19, 2019. 

Under the AMA, claimants may elect to review a decision by the AOJ by either filing a Supplemental Claim, submitting a request for a Higher-Level Review (HLR), or submit an appeal to the Board via a VA Form 10182. Current regulations prohibit concurrent election of review of a VA decision under different appeal lanes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

The Veterans Claims Court has emphasized that concurrent elections are prohibited as a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option did not run concurrently with the first administrative review option. See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).

The Court's holding was expressly predicated on finding that multiple administrative review requests were "not pending concurrently," as this would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A). Id., at 2-3. Accordingly, only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues.

Procedurally, with regard to the claim for entitlement to service connection for diabetes, the AOJ denied the claim in its October 2018 legacy rating decision. The Veteran did not perfect an appeal to the Board, nor did he submit relevant evidence within one year of that decision; therefore, the October 2018 decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 20.302, 20.1103.

As noted, the AMA became effective February 19, 2019. As the October 2018 rating decision predated the effective date of the AMA, the legacy appellate system governed that rating decision. Consequently, the Veteran's filing of VA Form 10182 under AMA (rather than a legacy VA Form 9) was improper. Additionally, and notwithstanding the use of an improper form, the November 2021 VA Form 10182 was untimely as to the October 2018 legacy rating decision.

Under the legacy appeals system, an appeal consists of a timely filed NOD and, after an SOC has been furnished, a timely filed substantive appeal via a VA Form 9. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.200. By regulation, a substantive appeal must consist of a properly completed VA Form 9 or correspondence containing the necessary information. See Cuevas v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 542, 546 (1992); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

Further, the substantive appeal must either indicate that all the issues presented in the applicable SOC or supplemental SOC (SSOC) are being appealed or, if only particular issues are being appealed, should specify those. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. The substantive appeal must be filed within sixty days after the mailing of the SOC, or within the remainder of the one-year period from the mailing of notification of the determination being appealed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

This filing deadline may be extended for a reasonable period on request for good cause shown. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. A request for such an extension should be in writing and must be made prior to expiration of the time limit for filing the substantive appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

As indicated above, the Veteran did not submit a substantive appeal within one year of the October 2018 legacy rating decision. In addition, more than a year following the October 2018 legacy rating decision, in June 2021, he filed new claims for entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus (on June 16, 2021 and June 30, 2021). In June 2021, the AOJ notified him that he must file the request for review of the previously denied claim for diabetes mellitus on a proper VA form.

Consequently, an untimely appeal deprives the Board of jurisdiction to consider the merits of an appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c). Under these circumstances, the Board does not have authority to review the appeal for diabetes mellitus. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
