ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is in relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is related to his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from August 1982 to August 1984.  

The decision on appeal was issued in May 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  The Veteran timely appealed the May 2024 rating decision in June 2024.  The Veteran requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  If evidence was added to the record during an ineligible period identified above, the Board has not considered that evidence.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  The Board need not wait until the expiration of the time period for selecting a different docket because the benefit sought is being granted in full.  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024) ("because [38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2)] gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the AOJ mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up").

In the May 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the following favorable findings: the Veteran's military occupational specialty exposed him to hazardous noise during service and on VA examination in May 2024 he was diagnosed with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  This may be accomplished by affirmatively showing inception or aggravation during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may also be granted for disability shown after service, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, shows that it was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

For the showing of chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word "chronic."  Continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required where the disorder noted during service is not, in fact, shown to be chronic or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

For a Veteran who served 90 days or more of active service after December 31, 1946, there is a presumption of service connection for organic diseases of the nervous system, such as sensorineural hearing loss, if the disability is manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).

Impaired hearing is considered a disability for VA purposes when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; where the auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater or when the Maryland CNC speech recognition scores are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels, with higher threshold levels indicating some degree of hearing loss.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).

The Veteran contends that he has had bilateral hearing loss since service.  See, e.g., April 2024 claim and May 2024 notice of disagreement.  In the April 2024 claim, the Veteran indicated that his hearing loss worsened in January 2012.  VA treatment records including in July 2016 show that the Veteran was issued hearing aids in 2013.

Service treatment records do not show the Veteran had bilateral hearing loss.  

The Veteran's DD 214 Form shows his military occupational specialty was attack helicopter repairer. 

The Veteran meets the regulatory criteria for bilateral hearing loss.  On the VA audiological examination in May 2024 the Veteran at 3000 Hertz had 65 decibels in the right ear and 60 decibels in the left ear along with a diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.  Hence, there is probative evidence with regard to a nexus on the basis of continuity of symptomatology pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), as the Veteran has a diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and he is competent to report that he has experienced symptoms of bilateral hearing loss since service.  His contentions are credible and consistent with the circumstances of his service, to include acoustic trauma.  

The file includes an unfavorable VA opinion.  On the VA audiological examination in May 2024 the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's right and left ear hearing loss was due to service.  The examiner acknowledged that although the Veteran had exposure to acoustic trauma during service, he wore hearing protection most of the time, service treatment records do not show hearing loss, and his wife reported that he started complaining of not hearing the television when he was 26 years old, which was 6 years after service.  

Considering the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss, in light of the record and the governing legal authority, the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds that the evidence is in relative equipoise on the question of a nexus based on his exposure to acoustic trauma during service.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
