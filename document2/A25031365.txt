DATE: April 4, 2025

REMANDED

The issue of entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 16, 2022, for the assignment of an increased, 70 percent rating for persistent depressive disorder is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1981 to July 1984.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from April 30, 2024, letter from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which notified the Veteran that it would not adjudicate a Supplemental Claim received in March 2024 for an earlier effective date.  

In August 2024, the Veteran's attorney, John S. Berry, submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on the Veteran's behalf on which he elected the Direct Review docket.  The specific issue of disagreement was identified as "disagreement with VA decision to not establish Veteran's claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date for persistent depressive disorder, submitted on a Supplemental Claim dated March 14, 2024."  On the VA Form 10182 itself, the attorney listed "Unknown" under the "Date of Decision" that the Veteran wished to appeal.  Interpreting the VA Form 10182 liberally, the Board finds the VA Form 10182 as an appeal of the April 2024 letter that rejected a March 2024 Supplemental Claim seeking an effective date earlier than August 16, 2022, for the award of an increased, 70 percent rating for persistent depressive disorder.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after that AOJ letter on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 16, 2022, for the assignment of an increased, 70 percent rating for persistent depressive disorder.

Remands under the modernized review system are limited to pre-decisional duty to assist errors and "correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim."  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

By way of history, on February 20, 2020, the Veteran filed an Intent to File a Claim for Compensation, followed by a complete Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, VA Form 21-526EZ, received in September 2020, seeking service connection for a psychiatric disability secondary to his service-connected lumbar strain disability (among other issues claimed).  In a September 2021 rating decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, granted service connection for persistent depressive disorder and assigned an initial 30 percent rating effective February 10, 2020.

In April 2022, the Veteran appointed attorney John S. Berry as his representative.

On June 30, 2022, Mr. Berry submitted an Intent to File a Claim for Compensation, VA Form 21-0966, on the Veteran's behalf, followed by a Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, in July 2022 requesting review of the September 2021 decision that assigned the initial 30 percent rating.  

In a November 2022 rating decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, increased the disability rating for persistent depressive disorder to 70 percent effective August 16, 2022, which is the date the Veteran attended a VA fee-basis mental disorders examination to evaluate the current severity of his disability.

In December 2022, Mr. Berry submitted on the Veteran's behalf a Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), VA Form 20-0996, seeking, in pertinent part, an effective date earlier than August 16, 2022, for the increased, 70 percent rating for persistent depressive disorder that was assigned in the November 2022 decision.  In accompanying correspondence, Mr. Berry argued that the Veteran was "entitled to an earlier effective date for his mental health disability rating of 70 [percent], as this contention has been continuously appealed since he was granted service connection in the September 23, 2021, rating decision and given an effective date of February 10, 2020."  He added that the "RO's erroneous legal conclusion that the effective date of the increase to 70 percent cannot be earlier than the date of the August 16, 2022, examination is wrong."

In a March 2023 HLR rating decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, denied an effective date earlier than August 16, 2022, for the award of an increased, 70 percent rating for persistent depressive disorder.  

In March 2024, within one year of the March 2023 notification of the HLR rating decision, Mr. Berry submitted a Supplemental Claim on the Veteran's behalf, seeking, in pertinent part, "Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the evaluation of persistent depression disorder, prior to August 16, 2022," and review of the March 2023 HLR rating decision.  In an accompanying brief, Mr. Berry indicated that the Veteran was submitting new and relevant evidence in support of his claim but went to explain why he believed a 70 percent disability rating was warranted effective February 10, 2020.  Mr. Berry's brief included argument in support of the Veteran's claim, but he failed to provide any evidence.  

On April 30, 2024, the AOJ issued a letter to the Veteran and his attorney which stated:   

We received your claim for an earlier effective date.  We notified you of our prior decision for No factual or legal error was noted.  An earlier effective date has also previously been denied for these contentions., on August 16, 2022. 

Since you did not seek a decision review option within one year of August 16, 2022, the decision is now final.  VA cannot accept a claim for an earlier effective date on a final regional office decision without new and relevant evidence.  However, you may request revision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) with respect to the assignment of the effective date.

In addition to being somewhat nonsensical, the April 2024 AOJ letter incorrectly suggested that it had decided a claim on August 16, 2022.  In fact, a review of the evidence of record reflects that no decision was made or issued on that date.  Instead, August 16, 2022, was the assigned effective date that the AOJ increased the disability rating to 70 percent for persistent depressive disorder in the November 2022 rating decision.

The Board also notes that on July 25, 2024, the AOJ issued another letter to the Veteran and his attorney regarding an "allegation of a clear and unmistakable error (CUE)."  The AOJ indicated,

We previously decided your allegation of CUE on the same basis and notified you of our decision on 3/21/23.  That decision is not final.  A claimant is not entitled to request CUE again once there has been a final decision denying CUE on the same basis.  We will take no further action on your request.

The only AOJ decision made on March 21, 2023, was the HLR rating decision, which was issued on March 31, 2023.  A review of that decision reflects that none of the issues decided, including the issue of entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 16, 2022, for the award of an increased, 70 percent rating for service-connected persistent depressive disorder, had been predicated on a theory based on CUE.  Similarly, a review of the argument submitted by Mr. Berry with the December 2022 request for HLR reflects that he did not file a motion for revision of a prior AOJ decision on the basis of CUE.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).

In summary, the April 2024 letter that notified the Veteran and his attorney that the AOJ would not take any action on the Supplemental Claim received on March 14, 2024, offered factually incorrect bases for declining to consider the claim. 

As detailed above, the Board interprets the VA Form 10182 received on August 16, 2024, liberally as an appeal of the April 2024 letter that rejected a March 2024 Supplemental Claim seeking an effective date earlier than August 16, 2022, for the award of an increased, 70 percent rating for persistent depressive disorder.

Pertinent to this appeal, a claimant or his authorized representative, if any, who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim by submitting in writing or electronically a complete application on a form prescribed by the Secretary any time after the AOJ issues a notice of a decision, regardless of whether the claim is pending or has become finally adjudicated.  If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.  If new and relevant evidence is not presented or secured, the AOJ will issue a decision finding that there was insufficient evidence to readjudicate the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  

In this case, the Board finds that a remand is necessary because the AOJ failed to comply with its regulatory duty to issue a decision following receipt of the March 14, 2024, supplemental claim.  Neither the AOJ letter issued on April 30, 2024, nor the AOJ letter issued on July 25, 2024, absolves the AOJ from satisfying its regulatory duty to either "readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record" or to "issue a decision finding that there was insufficient evidence to readjudicate the claim."  Id. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Adjudicate the supplemental claim received on March 14, 2024, regarding the issue of entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 16, 2022, for the award of an increased, 70 percent rating for persistent depressive disorder.
