DOCKET NO. 210915-185040
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to the issue of entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On October 7, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal as to the issue of entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1985 to June 1995.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2021 rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). In September 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), in which he elected the Hearing Review docket. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.302. However, the Veteran later withdrew his claim in a written communication. Accordingly, the request for a hearing is considered withdrawn. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.704(e).

Withdrawal and Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative. Id.

Here, in October 2024, prior to the promulgation of a Board decision in this matter, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, submitted a statement which included his name and file number. See Third Party Correspondence, received October 7, 2024. The statement indicated that the Veteran wished to "withdraw the following issue(s): [...] Hypertension[.]" Id. Notably, the statement was signed by the Veteran's representative and specifically identified the issue on appeal. The Board therefore finds that these statements satisfy the requirements for a written withdrawal. See 38 C.F.R. § 19.55; see also Hembree v. Wilkie, 33?Vet. App.?1 (2020). Consequently, there are no allegations of error of fact or law remaining for appellate consideration as to the issue of entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension. As such, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal at this time and the claim is dismissed.
