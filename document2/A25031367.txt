ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with alcohol use disorder is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as PTSD with alcohol use disorder, is etiologically related to his active duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for PTSD with alcohol use disorder have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.384, 4.125.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1998 to August 2012, with additional service in the Navy Reserve.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision adjudicated under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

Within the framework of the AMA, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge in May 2024.  See May 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  The Board notes that under the direct review option, no additional evidence received after the appealed rating decision is to be considered; rather, review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2(d), 20.301.

The Board has re-characterized the claim for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include consideration of multiple diagnoses, to include PTSD, chronic insomnia, major depressive disorder, and alcohol use disorder.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (The scope of a disability claim includes any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

There are particular requirements for establishing service connection for PTSD which must be met independently of the general requirements for service connection.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f); Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a), that is, a diagnosis that conforms to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.384.

The Veteran states that his acquired psychiatric disorder was caused by an accident that occurred while he was overseeing boat exercises as the Petty Officer In-charge in Bahrain in or around 2010 or 2011.  Specifically, he reported that one of his sailors lost a leg after he was struck by an out-of-control boat during the exercise and noted that the limb appeared to be "hanging from tissue" when he was removed from the water.  In this regard, he explained that he had been living in a constant state of fear since the accident and endorsed nightmares, flashbacks, guilt, depression, anxiety, and self-blame.  In addition, he stated that he had not allowed himself to take on any leadership positions since service because he could not "get the visions of that day out of [his] head" or trust himself.  See October 2021 VA Form 21-0781, Statement in Support of Claim for PTSD; April 2023 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim; February 2024 VA 21-0781, Statement in Support of Claim for PTSD; see also April 2023 VA Form 21-10210 - Lay Witness Statement.

Alternatively, the Veteran states that his acquired psychiatric disorder may have been caused by witnessing multiple injuries and deaths during service.  In this regard, he reported that two sailors who served in his unit were killed after their helicopter crashed while they were conducting heavy lift operations in Oman in July 2012.  He also reported that his symptoms may have been caused by being belittled and treated unfairly during service.  See December 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation); February 2024 VA 21-0781, Statement in Support of Claim for PTSD.

A review of the service personnel records (SPRs) shows that the Veteran served as the rigid-hulled inflatable boat coxswain and lead engineer assigned to Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron Fifteen from July 2007 to August 2012.  In addition, evaluation report and counseling records dated from March 2008 to August 2012 show that the Veteran's command was located in the Arabian sea and maintained a world-wide 72-hour Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) rapid deployment posture and a four aircraft forward-deployed AMCM and vertical onboard delivery capability.  See October 2021 DPRIS Response.

In addition, memoranda dated in December 2022 and January 2023 show that Department of Defense deployment records document the Veteran's receipt of fire pay, imminent danger pay, and/or hazardous duty pay for service in Bahrain from June 2008 through November 2011 and from April 2012 through July 2012.  See December 2022 VA Memorandum; January 2023 VA Memorandum.

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) shows a July 1998 enlistment report of medical examination that notes his psychiatric health to be normal.  In November 2005, the Veteran endorsed difficulties sleeping and daytime somnolence, as well as witnessed choking and gasping, but a cardiopulmonary sleep study performed one week later was normal and did not reveal snoring or evidence of obstructive sleep apnea.  During a May 2008 periodic health assessment, the Veteran's health risk level was noted to be high, and his health risks were remarkable for alcohol consumption, stress management, and sleep.  However, no acute or ongoing issues were found on the Veteran's August 2012 separation physical, and he denied frequent trouble sleeping, depression or excessive worry, and ever receiving counseling or being evaluated or treated for a mental condition on the corresponding report of medical history.  See October 2021 DPRIS Record; October 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility; February 2023 JLV/MFT; March 2023 STR. 

A review of the post-service treatment records shows that the Veteran sought treatment for worsening chronic sleep problems, racing and intrusive thoughts, intrusive memories, self-blame, depressed mood, low energy, intermittent hopelessness, feeling overwhelmed, irritability, angry outbursts, loss of interest, impaired concentration, decreased memory, and decreased appetite in January 2022.  At that time, he also reported continuous flashbacks to the operation he oversaw in service during which another sailor lost a leg.  In this regard, the Veteran explained that he initially tried to treat his chronic sleep impairment by exercising but indicated that he began using alcohol to self-medicate during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The differential diagnoses included PTSD, depression, alcohol use disorder, and chronic insomnia.  Subsequent treatment records show that the Veteran has consistently been diagnosed with insomnia, PTSD, major depressive disorder, and alcohol use disorder.  See December 2023 CAPRI; February 2024 CAPRI.

Records research responses dated in November 2022 and September 2023 show that the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) requested records from Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC), the custodian of Naval command history records, from 2011 to verify the Veteran's claimed stressor event.  However, the response shows that the NHHC was unable to locate the 2011 command history, squadron history, or Aviation Historical Summary for Helicopter Mine Countermeasure Squadron Fifteen or the command operation report for Naval Support Activity in Bahrain, and as such, that no evidence was found to support documentation of the Veteran's claimed stressor event.  See November 2022 Records Research Center Response; September 2023 Records Research Center Response.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for PTSD in October 2023.  The examiner diagnosed PTSD and noted a secondary diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  During the examination, the Veteran reported that his symptoms manifested after another sailor lost his leg in a boating accident during an operation he was overseeing in or around 2011.  In this regard, he stated that his superior subsequently told him that he would not be promoted to the next level.  However, he also indicated that he began to question his leadership skills and the Navy following the accident and ultimately decided to be discharged shortly thereafter.  The Veteran also endorsed intrusive thoughts, insomnia, exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, noise sensitivity, anger, irritability, and seeing things out of the corner of his eyes and noted that constant self-doubt had led him to turn down multiple leadership positions since service.

After performing an examination and reviewing the evidence of record, the examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's PTSD was incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  In support of her opinion, the examiner noted the Veteran's reports that he saw another sailor lose a leg in an accident that occurred while he was overseeing boating exercises in service.  In this regard, she emphasized that the Veteran reported the same incident when he initially sought treatment for his psychiatric symptoms and during the examination.  She further noted that the Veteran was in-charge at the time of the accident and explained that his current PTSD and alcohol use symptoms were consistent with those she would expect to see from someone who experienced the trauma described by the Veteran.  See October 2023 C&P examination.

The Veteran also underwent a VA examination for PTSD in March 2024.  The examiner diagnosed PTSD and moderate alcohol use disorder, secondary to PTSD.  During the examination, the Veteran reported that his psychiatric symptoms manifested after an in-service accident that caused another sailor to lose his leg during an operation he was overseeing in or around 2011.  In this regard, he stated that he blamed himself for the accident because he was in charge at the time it occurred and indicated that he began having nightmares and left service shortly thereafter.  Alternatively, the Veteran stated that his psychiatric symptoms may have been caused by witnessing four helicopter crashes while he was assigned to Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron Fifteen.  In this regard, he explained that he was part of the cleaning crew, which caused him to be exposed to blood, dead bodies, and body parts.  Following the examination, the examiner stated that the Veteran's anxiety and depression symptoms were subsumed under his PTSD diagnosis and that alcohol abuse disorder was secondary to diagnosed PTSD and overlapping with symptoms.  However, the examiner did not proffer an opinion as to whether the Veteran's diagnosed psychiatric disorders were etiologically related to his active duty service.  See March 2024 C&P examination.

After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as PTSD with alcohol use disorder, is warranted.

Regarding the question of whether the Veteran has a current disability, the Board notes that the October 2023 and March 2024 VA examiners utilized the DSM-5 criteria and provided diagnoses of PTSD and alcohol use disorder.  See October 2023 C&P examination; March 2024 C&P examination.  In addition, the Veteran's post-service treatment records show that he has consistently been diagnosed with, in pertinent part, PTSD and alcohol use disorder.  See December 2023 CAPRI; February 2024 CAPRI.  Accordingly, the Veteran has a diagnosis that conforms with the requirements under 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) and has thus met the first element of service connection.  

Upon review, the Board notes the VA has not verified the Veteran's reported in-service stressors, which is required in certain circumstances to award service connection for PTSD.  In this regard, the record does not support a finding that the stressor did not occur; rather, the NHHC was merely unable to provide the command history records for that specific year.  As a result, the Board will not unfairly prejudice the Veteran for the NHHC's failure to provide records that could have substantiated his in-service stressors.  Instead, the Board finds that the Veteran's claimed stressors are consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service.  Notably, the Veteran's SPRs confirm that he was assigned to Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron Fifteen from July 2007 to August 2012 and that he served as the rigid-hulled inflatable boat coxswain and lead engineer during that time, and Department of Defense deployment records show that the Veteran received fire pay, imminent danger pay, and/or hazardous duty pay for service in Bahrain from June 2008 through November 2011 and from April 2012 through July 2012.  In addition, evaluation report and counseling records dated from March 2008 to August 2012 show that the Veteran's command was located in the Arabian sea.  See October 2021 DPRIS Response; December 2022 VA Memorandum; January 2023 VA Memorandum.  In this regard, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements regarding his in-service events and symptoms are competent, credible, and consistent with his types, places, and circumstances of his service and, thus, are entitled to probative weight.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  

Moreover, the Board finds that the October 2023 VA examiner's opinion, when considered in connection with the cumulative medical evidence of record, to include the March 2024 VA examination report, is probative and adequate to corroborate the Veteran's reports that his diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder was incurred in or caused by seeing another sailor lose a leg in an accident that occurred while he was overseeing boating exercises in service.  In this regard, she emphasized that the Veteran reported the same incident when he initially sought treatment for his psychiatric symptoms as he did during the examination.  She further noted that the Veteran was in-charge at the time of the accident and explained that his current PTSD and alcohol use symptoms were consistent with those she would expect to see from someone who experienced the trauma described by the Veteran.  See October 2023 C&P examination.

Upon review, the Board finds the October 2023 VA medical opinion deserves significant probative value as it was based on an in-person interview of the Veteran, a thorough review of the claims file, and included an explanation containing clear conclusions and supporting data.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  Additionally, the Board notes that there is no contrary medical opinion of record.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran's diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder is etiologically related to his active duty service.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Thus, service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as PTSD with alcohol use disorder, is warranted.  The claim is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
