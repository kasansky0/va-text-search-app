ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. There is an approximate balance of evidence showing that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is related to his active military service, including noise exposure.

2. Noise exposure is consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With resolution of reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from May 1994 to May 1998.  Additionally, the Veteran had active duty for training (ACDUTRA) in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves, with periods of inactive duty for training (INACDTURA).

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss

The Veteran contends that he has bilateral hearing loss that is related to in-service noise exposure.

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Establishing service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, such as sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 101 (24) "active military, naval, or air service" includes active duty; any period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated in the line of duty; and any period of inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA) during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an injury incurred in or aggravated in the line of duty or from an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident that occurred during such training.

For the purposes of determining service connection based on Reserve service, ACDUTRA means full-time training duty, where the service member is available for duty around-the-clock performed by the Reserve components.  38 U.S.C. § 101 (22); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (c). Annual two-week training is an example of ACDUTRA. Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated while performing ACDUTRA. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (24), 106, 1110, 1131.

Generally, when a claim for service connection is based only on a period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA, there must be evidence the appellant became disabled as a result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during that period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA for service connection to be granted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (2), (22), (24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (a); Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167 (2010); Acciola v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 320, 324 (2008). In the absence of such evidence, the period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA would not qualify as "active military, naval, or air service," and the appellant would not qualify as a "veteran" for that period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA service alone. 38 U.S.C. § 101 (2), (24); Acciola, 22 Vet. App. at 324.

Specifically, service connection may also be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred during ACDUTRA or injuries incurred during INACDUTRA, or from an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), a cardiac arrest or a cerebrovascular accident (stroke), which occurred during such training. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (24), 106; 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (a). 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (a) permits service connection for acute myocardial infraction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident which occurred during INACDUTRA training.

Impaired hearing constitutes a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels. Higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993). The auditory thresholds set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 establish when hearing loss is severe enough to be considered a disability eligible for service connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Turning to the record, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) reveal that the Veteran did not have a record of hearing loss at the time of enlistment.  Nor do the STRs demonstrate that the Veteran complained of or was treated for hearing loss while in service.  Equally, at the time of his separation from active service, the separation examination does not report that the Veteran had hearing loss.  The Veteran's Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) is noted as a bulk fuel specialist during active service.

A private record from March 2013 noted the Veteran had decreased hearing loss for years. He did have some noise exposure through work. 

In a May 2023 statement, the Veteran described that during active service he was responsible for providing fuel to fighter jets while their engines were still running.  He explained that the environment was very load even with the use of hearing protection. 

In July 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination.  At the time of the encounter, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15 	25	55	60	65

LEFT	15	25	60	55	55

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 64 percent in the right ear and of 68 percent in the left ear.  

A diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was rendered.  The Veteran reported that post-service the Veteran worked as a carpenter and reported that hearing protection is always worn on site.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was not incurred in or caused by the Veteran's active service.  The examiner explained that the Veteran did not experience permanent positive threshold shift during military service. At separation, the Veteran's hearing did not experience a significant threshold shift at any tested frequency in either ear. MOS has a moderate probability of hazardous noise exposure. The examiner did not acknowledge the post-active duty Reserve service. 

In October 2023, another VA medical opinion was obtained.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was not due to any toxic risk exposure activity (TERA) during active service.  In particular, the examiner noted that though military-grade fuels and various other toxic fumes are known to be toxic to the auditory system.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's hearing was within normal limits at the time of separation, reports were negative for STS; therefore, the examiner concluded that factors outside of military service outweigh the Veteran's claims. Again, the examiner did not acknowledge the post-active duty Reserve service.

Noise exposure was presumed based on this the Veteran's MOS of bulk fuel specialist, per the favorable finding in the November 2023 rating decision. 

The Board has been charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F. 3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Indeed, the Court has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to do so. Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 488-89 (2000).  In this case, the Board finds the Veteran is competent to report regarding the symptoms he experienced, and the Board finds his statements credible.  See also See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1372.

The Board finds the July 2023 and October 2023 VA medical opinions are inadequate for adjudication purposes.  Specifically, VA has presumed that the Veteran was exposed to military noise.  The July 2023 opinion noted the noise exposure especially but also seemingly pointed to a lack of evidence in the file as negative evidence in rendering a negative etiological opinion, which is not allowed.  As the opinion is inadequate, it cannot serve as the basis of a denial of entitlement to service connection.  Likewise, the October 2023 VA examiner determined that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was not due to toxic exposure, however, although the examiner acknowledge military noise exposure, the examiner did not explain its connection to the Veteran's exposure to toxins or its relationship to the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss. 

The Board notes that lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. In fact, competent medical evidence is not necessarily required when the determinative issue involves either medical etiology or a medical diagnosis.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1372; Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  As noted above, the Veteran is competent to identify reduced hearing acuity and report on the chronicity of symptomatology since active service. 

Consequently, the Board finds that the Veteran has sustained acoustic trauma due to military noise exposure while on active service in the military.  The Veteran's service as a bulk fuel specialist indicates that it was moderately probable that he had hazardous noise exposure while in-service.  The service personnel records state that the Veteran had Reserve duty to April 2002. Further, the Veteran is competent to report experiencing and observing these symptoms.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77.  These statements are consistent with the circumstances of his service, and the Board finds the Veteran's statements to be probative and credible.  While there are VA medical opinions of record against the claim, these opinions are not adequate.  

The Board finds that the evidence for and against the claim of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability is at least in approximate balance.  Reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran and entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).
