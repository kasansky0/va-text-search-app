ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of February 19, 2010 for the grant of service connection for left knee osteoarthritis is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of February 19, 2010 for the grant of service connection for right knee osteoarthritis is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  On February 19, 2010, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for a bilateral knee condition. 

2. In a March 2011 rating decision the claim was denied and the Veteran perfected an appeal to the Board from this decision. 

3. On February 2, 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) issued a decision under the legacy system that denied entitlement to service connection for a bilateral knee disability as part of the continuing appeal of the February 19, 2010 claim. 

4.  On March 1, 2021, the Veteran filed at the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), in which he requested review of the February 2, 2021 Board decision's denial of his service connection claim for a bilateral knee disorder based on new and relevant evidence.

5. In an April 2021 rating action, the AOJ granted the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral knee condition.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of February 19, 2010, for the grant of service connection for left knee osteoarthritis have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400, 3.2500(c).

2.  The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of February 19, 2010, for the grant of service connection for right knee osteoarthritis have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400, 3.2500(c).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army from January 1970 to November 1971.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2021 rating decision.  As this rating decision constitutes an initial decision, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 9, 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on December 5, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As discussed further below, the March 2021 rating decision on appeal granted entitlement to service connection for left knee osteoarthritis and right knee osteoarthritis, assigning an initial 10 percent rating for each disability effective from March 1, 2021.  On April 1, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and indicated he was requesting review of the March 2021 rating decision's initial assigned disability ratings for the right and left knee disabilities as well as the effective date awarded for the grant service connection for these disabilities.  On April 27, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in which he selected the Direct Review docket and again identified the March 2021 rating decision, indicating that he sought an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for the right and left knee disabilities.  In an April 29, 2021 letter, the Board notified the Veteran that it could not review the Veteran's case in relation to the VA Form 10182 as the Veteran already requested HLR for the issues he listed on the form, and he could only choose one review option for each issue.  

The record shows that in response to the April 1, 2021 VA Form 20-0996, the AOJ issued a June 2021 HLR Decision that continued the currently assigned 10 percent evaluation for left knee osteoarthritis and right knee osteoarthritis.  Although not clearly noted in the decision's determinations, the AOJ also stated under the reasons for decision that entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to March 1, 2021 was not established for either the left or right knee disability.  A June 14, 2021 letter notified of the Veteran of this decision and his appellate rights.  The Veteran later submitted the July 9, 2021 VA Form 10182 pertinent to this appeal in which he elected the Hearing docket and indicated that he sought an earlier effective date for the grant service connection for the left and right knee disabilities in relation to the March 2021 rating decision.  Based on the foregoing, the Board does not find that the Veteran's prior submission of the April 1, 2021 VA Form 20-0996 is still pending in relation to the earlier effective date issues on appeal from the March 2021 rating decision.  See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023) (a claimant can file more than one administrative review request in response to an AOJ decision, provided that the requests are filed within one year of the AOJ decision and that the review requests are not pending concurrently).  As such, the Board will proceed to adjudicate the Veteran's appeal of these issues herein.

1.  Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 1, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee osteoarthritis.

2.  Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 1, 2021 for the grant of service connection for right knee osteoarthritis.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The effective date for an award of service connection is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date is the later of the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement to service connection arose.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

For purposes of determining the effective date of an award, the date of application shall be considered the date of the filing of the initial application for a benefit if the claim is continuously pursued by filing any of the following, either alone or in succession:  (A) A request for higher-level review under 38 U.S.C. § 5104B on or before the date that is one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues a decision; (B) a supplemental claim under 38 U.S.C. § 5108 on or before the date that is one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues a decision; (C) a notice of disagreement on or before the date that is one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues a decision; (D) a supplemental claim under section 5108 of this title 38 U.S.C. § 5108 on or before the date that is one year after the date on which the Board of Veterans' Appeals issues a decision; and (E) a supplemental claim under 38 U.S.C. § 5108 on or before the date that is one year after the date on which the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims issues a decision.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2).

A claim that is adjudicated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as either allowed or disallowed is considered finally adjudicated when, for legacy claims not subject to the modernized review system, whichever of the following occurs first: (i) the expiration of the period in which to file a Notice of Disagreement, pursuant to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 19.52(a) or 38 C.F.R. § 20.502(a), as applicable; or (ii) disposition on appellate review.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d)(1).  For claims under the modernized review system, a claim is considered finally adjudicated upon the expiration of the period in which to file a review option available under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 or disposition on judicial review where no such review option is available.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d)(2).

A reopened claim is an application for a benefit received prior to the effective date of the modernized review system on February 19, 2019, after final disallowance of an earlier claim that is subject to readjudication on the merits based on receipt of new and material evidence related to the finally adjudicated claim, or any claim based on additional evidence or a request for a personal hearing submitted more than 90 days following notification to the appellant of the certification of an appeal and transfer of applicable records to the Board which was not considered by the Board in its decision and was referred to the agency of original jurisdiction for consideration as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304(b)(1).  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(e), 19.2(a).  As of February 19, 2019, claimants may no longer file to reopen a claim, but may file a supplemental claim as prescribed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 to apply for a previously disallowed benefit.  Id.  Except as otherwise provided, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issued a decision or the Board of Veterans' Appeals issued a decision, the effective date shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(3).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats.  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155).  The amendments apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

A claimant, his or her duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not of full age or capacity, who indicates a desire to file for benefits under the laws administered by VA, by a communication or action, to include an electronic mail that is transmitted through VA's electronic portal or otherwise, that does not meet the standards of a complete claim is considered a request for an application form for benefits under § 3.150(a).  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  Upon receipt of such a communication or action, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form or form prescribed by the Secretary.  Id.

Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by VA.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by VA, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  An intent to file a claim can be submitted in one of three ways, including a saved electronic application.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1).  When an application otherwise meeting the requirements of this paragraph (b) is electronically initiated and saved in a claims-submission tool within a VA web-based electronic claims application system prior to filing of a complete claim, VA will consider that application to be an intent to file a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1)(i).  The Board notes that the preface to the amended version of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 states that the provisions of this section are applicable to all claims governed by part 3, with the exception that paragraph (b) of this section, regarding Intent to File, does not apply to supplemental claims.  However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit invalidated the portion of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 that excluded supplemental claims from the Intent to File framework because it contravened the unambiguous meaning of its governing statutory provisions.  Military-Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

A complete claim is required for all types of claims.  If a complete claim is submitted within one year of receipt of such incomplete application form prescribed by VA, VA will consider it as filed as of the date VA received the incomplete application form prescribed by VA that did not meet the standards of a complete claim.  Only one complete claim for a benefit (e.g., compensation, pension) may be associated with each intent to file a claim for that benefit, though multiple issues may be contained within a complete claim. In the event multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within one year of an intent to file a claim for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim.  In the event that VA receives both an intent to file a claim and an incomplete application form before the complete claim is filed, the complete claim will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of whichever was filed first provided it is perfected within the necessary timeframe, but in no event will the complete claim be considered filed more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the complete claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(c)-(d).

A complete claim is defined as a submission of an application form prescribed by VA, whether paper or electronic, that meets the following requirements:  (1) provides the name of the claimant; the relationship to the veteran, if applicable; and sufficient service information for VA to verify the claimed service, if applicable; (2) is signed by the claimant or a person legally authorized to sign for the claimant; (3) identifies the benefit sought; (4) provides a description of any symptom(s) or medical condition(s) on which the benefit is based to the extent the form prescribed by VA so requires; and (5) for nonservice-connected disability or death pension and parents' dependency and indemnity compensation claims, provides a statement of income to the extent the form prescribed by VA so requires.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a).

Under the former regulations prior to March 24, 2015, a specific claim in the form prescribed by VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim.  Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim.  See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

Medical records cannot constitute an initial claim for service connection; rather there must be some intent by the claimant to apply for the benefit.  Criswell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 501 (2006); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998).

A pending claim is a claim which has not been finally adjudicated.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(c).  The pending claims doctrine provides that a claim remains pending in the adjudication process if VA fails to act on it.  Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 422 (1999).  Raising a pending claim theory in connection with a challenge to the effective-date decision is procedurally proper.  Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 249, 255 (2007).

For pending legacy claims not under the modernized review system, new and material evidence received prior to the expiration of the appeal period, or prior to the appellate decision if a timely appeal has been filed, will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal period.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  Where a claim is granted based on new and material evidence received within an appeal period or prior to an appellate decision, the effective date shall be as though the former decision had not been rendered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q).

In regard to the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statue or regulation.  However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought.  This is determined on a "facts found" basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober; 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).  It is important to note that an effective date generally can be no earlier than the facts found.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011).  For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested.  Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

Analysis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to March 1, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee osteoarthritis and the grant of service connection for right knee osteoarthritis.  The Board agrees.

To determine the appropriate effective date, the Board must assess the date of claim and the date entitlement arose. As to date of claim, the record shows that the AOJ adjudicated the Veteran's service connection claim for a leg condition in multiple rating decisions.  As pertinent to this appeal, the Board previously issued an April 1979 decision in which the Board stated that entitlement to service connection for leg disorder was not established; accordingly, the benefits sought on appeal were denied.  A review of this decision reflects that the Board considered both the left and right leg, including the bilateral knees, in the context of this service connection claim.  An April 4, 1979 letter notified the Veteran of this decision and enclosed a copy for his review.

At the time of the April 1979 Board decision, 38 C.F.R. § 19.104 provided that decisions of the Board are final, with exception of claims involving insurance contracts that are subject to court review.  38 U.S.C. § 4004.  In addition, reconsideration by the Board could be accorded under the Rule 48 (§ 19.148).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 19.148(a), reconsideration of an appellate decision that was otherwise final under Rule 4 (§ 19.104) could be accorded upon allegation of error of fact or law by a claimant or his representative or on the Board's own motion.  38 U.S.C. § 4003.  In addition, reconsideration of an appellate decision may be accorded by the Board for obvious error of fact or law upon allegation by the claimant or on the Board's own motion.  38 C.F.R. § 19.148.  The record does not indicate that the Veteran requested reconsideration of the Board's April 1979 decision or that reconsideration was otherwise accorded by the Board.  In addition, as the April 1979 Board decision was issued prior to the establishment of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), in November 1988, the decision is final.  38 U.S.C. §§ 4003, 4004 (1976); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.104, 19.148 (1978). Thus, there are no pending claims prior to April 1979.

The next claim regarding the Veteran's bilateral knee condition was received by VA on February 19, 2010, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, reporting that he wanted to reopen his original claim for a bilateral knee condition.  In a March 2011 rating decision, the claim was denied.  A March 10, 2011 letter notified the Veteran of this decision and his appellate rights under the legacy system.  After the Veteran submitted an April 2011 notice of disagreement for this issue, the AOJ issued a responsive statement of the case in November 2014.  The Veteran then perfected his appeal to the Board with the submission of a December 2014 VA Form 9. This legacy appeal continued until the February 2, 2021 Board decision denying service connection for a bilateral knee condition on the merits. 

Subsequent to this decision, on March 1, 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) under the modernized review system in which he requested review of the February 2, 2021 Board decision's denial of his service connection claim for a bilateral knee disorder based on new and relevant evidence. In March 2021, the AOJ issued a rating decision in which it found that new and relevant evidence had been received prior to granting entitlement to service connection for right and left knee osteoarthritis. The Veteran continuously pursued this claim by filing an HLR request challenging the effective date assigned, and ultimately a VA Form 10182 appealing to the Board all timely and within the time period for continuous pursuit of a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  

Based on the above, the Board finds that the date of claim is February 19, 2010. The Veteran's claim has been pending since that time. The Veteran filed his Supplemental Claim in March 2021, within one year of the Board's February 2021 decision in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) which states that "A claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing one of the following administrative review options, as specified (except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c), (e), and (f) of this section), after any decision by the agency of original jurisdiction, Board of Veterans' Appeals, or by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, provided that any appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is timely filed as determined by the court." Further, as noted, he continuously pursued his claim for an effective date from the March 2021 decision granting service connection for a bilateral knee condition. Thus, the date of claim is February 19, 2010.

Turning to when entitlement arose, the Board finds that entitlement arose prior to the February 19, 2010, claim. While the Veteran's nexus letter was not received until 2021, in determining the date entitlement arose, the Board must determine when a claimant's disability manifested itself under all the "'facts found'" and "the date on which the evidence is submitted is irrelevant." McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000) (a statement regarding prior conditions may support an effective date prior to the date of the statement). See also Stowers v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 550, 553-54 (2014) ("the effective date of an award of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA."). Here, the nexus opinion establishes a link between the Veteran's bilateral knee arthritis and his active service, that link was present prior to the receipt of the medical opinion itself. Thus, entitlement arose prior to the February 19, 2010 date of claim.

Nonetheless, under the laws governing effective dates, the effective date is the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. In this case, February 19, 2010, the date of claim is the later of the two dates, and thus, this is the appropriate effective date for the award of service connection for the Veteran's bilateral knee arthritis.

Entitlement to an effective date of February 19, 2010, for the award of service connection for right and left knee osteoarthritis is granted.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
