ORDER

Entitlement to a rating of 40 percent, but no higher, for gastritis is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's gastritis was manifested by moderately severe symptomatology, with intercurrent episodes of abdominal pain at least once a month only partially relieved by ulcer therapy and mild and transient episodes of vomiting, without more severe symptomatology productive of definite impairment of health, recurrent melena or hematemesis, and weight loss.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a rating of 40 percent for gastritis have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.14, 4.112, 4.113, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7306.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1974 to November 1980 and from February 1991 to March 1991.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

Prior to this decision, the claim was denied in a February 2023 rating decision.  The Veteran filed a supplemental claim in March 2023.  The claim was again denied in an April 2023 rating decision, and the Veteran selected higher-level review of that decision in May 2023.  The August 2023 rating decision followed. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 rating decision, which was subject to higher-level review.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board notes that in the July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated that he wished to appeal the February 2023 rating decision, which is more than one year prior to the July 2024 VA Form 10182.  However, the Board will afford the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and consider his appeal as a disagreement with the August 2023 rating decision, which is within the one-year appeal period prior to the July 2024 VA Form 10182.  

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity caused by the given disability.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining, including degree of disability, is to be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In any claim for an increased rating, "staged" ratings may be warranted when the factual findings show distinct time periods when the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for gastritis.

The Veteran contends his gastritis warrants a higher rating than is currently assigned.  In an April 2010 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for gastritis and assigned a 10 percent rating, effective August 2, 2009; such rating was continued in all subsequent rating decisions. 

The appeal period before the Board begins on October 31, 2022, the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim for an increased rating, plus the one-year look-back period.  Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, ratings of digestive system disabilities under Diagnostic Codes 7301 to DC 7329, inclusive, Diagnostic Code 7331, Diagnostic Code 7342, and Diagnostic Codes 7345 to 7348, inclusive, will not be combined with each other. A single evaluation will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants elevation.

During the pendency of this appeal, the rating criteria for evaluating digestive disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 were amended effective May 19, 2024.  However, Diagnostic Code 7307 was not affected by the revisions, and the Board notes the medical evidence of record available for review is all dated prior to the amendment.  Thus, the Board will apply the pre-amendment rating criteria herein.

Under Diagnostic Code 7307, a 10 percent rating is assigned for chronic hypertrophic gastritis with small nodular lesions, and symptoms. A 30 percent rating is assigned for chronic hypertrophic gastritis with multiple small eroded or ulcerated areas, and symptoms. A maximum 60 percent rating is assigned for chronic hypertrophic gastritis with severe hemorrhages, or large ulcerated or eroded areas. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114.

Turning to the evidence of record, an October 2022 private treatment record documented that the Veteran was treated for unspecified gastritis without bleeding.  It was recommended that the Veteran follow up with his gastroenterologist (GI) specialist.  

An October 2022 VA treatment record documents that the Veteran presented to a private medical facility earlier that month with a chief complaint of severe abdominal pain.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2022 for stomach and duodenal conditions.  The examiner documented that the Veteran had a diagnosis of gastritis.  His current symptoms were reported as recurrent abdominal pain.  His current medications included Pantoprazole and Sucralfate.  The Veteran's signs and symptoms included four or more recurring episodes per year of severe and not severe symptoms, with the average episode lasting less than one day.  Abdominal pain was reported to occur at least monthly and was pronounced, periodic, and only partially relieved by standard ulcer therapy.  He also had recurrent nausea and vomiting more than four times per year, with each lasting less than one day in duration.  He did not report anemia, weight loss, hematemesis, or melena.  He did not have any incapacitating episodes due to his gastritis.  He also did not have hypertrophic gastritis, postgastrectomy syndrome, vagotomy with pyloroplasty or gastroenterostomy, or peritoneal adhesions.  The Veteran did not have any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms related to his gastritis.  He did not have any scars related to his gastritis.  No diagnostic or imaging testing were performed.  No laboratory testing was performed.  His gastritis did not impact his ability to work.  

In a December 2022 VA treatment record, the Veteran reported pain rated as an 8 out of 10 in his abdomen, which was increased by certain foods, and that the pain comes and goes. 

A March 2023 VA endoscopy report reflected that the Veteran's stomach had scant fragments of gastric mucosa with no significant diagnostic alteration, and that the biopsy was negative for H. pylori and intestinal metaplasia.  He also had a normal esophagus.  

Upon review of the evidence of the record, the Board finds that a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's gastritis is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 7307.  Here, there is no evidence of multiple small eroded or ulcerated areas and symptoms or severe hemorrhages or large ulcerated or eroded areas.  Moreover, the Board notes the VA examiner specifically found the Veteran did not have hypertrophic gastritis. 

As a result, the Board has considered the application of other diagnostic codes.  In this regard, the Board notes the Veteran's current symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  Upon review, the Board finds the Veteran's symptoms associated with his service-connected gastritis are more adequately compensated by the application of pre-amendment Diagnostic Code 7306.  Diagnostic Code 7306, which addresses marginal ulcers (gastrojejunal), provides, in pertinent part, a 40 percent rating for moderately severe symptomatology described as intercurrent episodes of abdominal pain at least once a month partially or completely relieved by ulcer therapy and mild and transient episodes of vomiting or melena.  Based on the Veteran's specific symptoms of four or more recurring episodes per year of severe and not severe symptoms, abdominal pain occurring at least monthly that was only partially relieved by standard ulcer therapy, and recurrent nausea and vomiting more than four times per year, the Board finds the criteria for a 40 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7306 have been met throughout the appeal period.  

With respect to the assignment of a higher rating under pre-amendment Diagnostic Code 7306, the evidence herein does not reflect definite impairment of health, to include any incapacitating episodes, recurring melena or hematemesis, and weight loss.  In this regard, the World Health Organization defines impairment of health as "any loss or abnormality of physiological, psychological, or an anatomical structure or function, whether permanent or temporary".  While the aforementioned evidence may reflect an abnormality of the Veteran's digestive system, the Board finds the resulting impairment described by the Veteran does not rise to the level of definite or severe.  Moreover, the requirements for a 60 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7306 indicate that such must include the same symptoms contemplated by the 100 percent rating (albeit of a less severe/frequent nature), which include melena or hematemesis and weight loss and which the Board notes are not shown herein.  Similarly, the evidence does not reflect symptoms of anemia or diagnoses of other digestive system disorders to warrant a higher rating under the remaining relevant diagnostic codes.

In making its determinations in this case, the Board has carefully considered the Veteran's contentions with respect to the nature of his service-connected gastritis and notes that his lay testimony is competent to describe certain symptoms associated with that disability.  The Veteran's history and symptom reports have been considered, including as presented in the medical evidence discussed above, and has been contemplated by the disability rating that has been assigned.  Moreover, the competent medical evidence offering detailed specific findings pertinent to the rating criteria is the most probative evidence with regard to evaluating the pertinent symptoms of the service-connected disability at issue.  

The Board has also considered whether staged ratings are appropriate for the Veteran's service-connected gastritis.  However, the Board finds his symptomatology has been stable throughout the appeal period.  Thus, assigning staged ratings for such is not warranted.  

Furthermore, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the increased rating claim adjudicated herein.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).  

Therefore, the Board finds a rating of 40 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's gastritis is warranted throughout the appeal period.  With respect to the award of a higher rating, the probative evidence persuasively weighs against such aspects of the Veteran's claim and, therefore, such must be otherwise denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
