ORDER

Entitlement to  Post 9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) educational assistance benefits through transfer of entitlement beyond April 28, 2021 is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In June 2013, the Veteran transferred Chapter 33 educational benefits to the appellant.

2. In her June 2015 Certificate of Eligibility, the appellant was informed that her eligibility to use the Veteran's Chapter 33 educational benefits would expire on April 28, 2021, once she reached the age of 26.

3. The appellant was not the Veteran's primary provider of personal care services under 38 U.S.C. § 1720G and was not prevented from pursuing a chosen program of education by reason of acting as the primary provider of personal care services for the Veteran prior to her 26th birthday.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits through transfer of entitlement beyond April 28, 2021 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1720G , 3301, 3311, 3313, 3319; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.57, 21.9570, 21.9625.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 2012 to October 2013, with additional time in the Army Reserve and National Guard. The appellant is the Veteran's daughter. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2022 administrative decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) under the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). In such election, the Veteran requested Direct Review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Consequently, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the administrative decision on December 22, 2022. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Entitlement to Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits through transfer of entitlement beyond April 28, 2021. 

The Post-9/11 GI Bill, 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33, provides for VA educational assistance for members of the Armed Forces based on active duty service after September 10, 2001. 38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520.

An individual who is entitled to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 based on his or her own active duty service, and who is approved by a service department to transfer entitlement, may transfer up to a total of 36 months of his or her entitlement to a dependent (or among dependents). 38 U.S.C. § 3319; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9570. VA will pay these transfer of entitlement benefits to the dependent and/or the dependent's institution of higher learning if the dependent is using transferred entitlement to pursue and complete the requirements of a secondary school diploma or equivalency certificate the amounts of educational assistance payable under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 in the same manner and at the same rate as if the transferor were enrolled in the dependent's program of education.

The Department of Defense (DoD) is charged with making determinations of eligibility for transfer of Chapter 33 entitlement to dependents; VA has no authority to determine such eligibility. See 38 U.S.C. § 3319; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9570; 74 Fed. Reg. 14,654 (2009); Garza v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 222, 230 (2016).

An eligible individual is any member of the uniformed services who, at the time of the approval of the individual's request to transfer entitlement to educational assistance under this section, has completed at least (1) six years of service in the armed forces and enters into an agreement to serve at least four more years as a member of the uniformed services; or (2) the years of service as determined in regulations pursuant to subsection (j). 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (b). Subsection (j) instructs that the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of VA, shall prescribe the regulation for purposes of this section, and that such regulations shall specify the manner of authorizing the transfer of entitlements under this section, the eligibility criteria in accordance with subsection (b), and the manner and effect of an election to modify or revoke a transfer of entitlement under subsection (f)(2). 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (j).

If a child is eligible for transferred entitlement under 38 C.F.R. § 21.9570, the beginning date of the award of educational assistance will be no earlier than the latest of the following dates: (1) The date the Secretary of the service department concerned approves the transferor to transfer entitlement; (2) The date the transferor completes 10 years of service in the Armed Forces; (3) The date the transferor specified in the designation of transfer; (4) The date the child first meets the definition of child in 38 C.F.R. § 3.57 of this chapter; or (5) Either: (i) The date the child completes the requirements of a secondary school diploma (or equivalency certificate); or (ii) The date the child attains age 18. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9625 (j).

In general, a child to whom entitlement is transferred may use the benefits transferred without regard to the 15-year delimiting date specified in 38 U.S.C. § 3321 but may not use any benefits so transferred after attaining the age of 26 years. 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (h)(5)(A).

However, an exception applies for children who are the VA primary providers of personal care services to a veteran. Specifically, in the case of a child who, before attaining the age of 26 years, is prevented from pursuing a chosen program of education by reason of acting as the primary provider of personal care services for a veteran or member of the Armed Forces under 38 U.S.C. § 1720G (a), the child may use the benefits beginning on the date specified in clause (iii) for a period whose length is specified in clause (iv). 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (h)(5)(B)(i). The date specified in clause (iii) is the later of (I) the date on which the child ceases acting as the primary provider of personal care services for the veteran or member concerned under 38 U.S.C. § 1720G (a); (II) the date on which it is reasonably feasible, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, for the child to initiate or resume the use of benefits; or (III) the date on which the child attains the age of 26 years. Clause (iv) specifies that the length of the period specified in this clause for the use of benefits by a child is the length equal to the length of the period that (I) begins on the date on which the child begins acting as the primary provider of personal care services for the veteran or member concerned; and, (II) ends on the later of: (aa) the date on which the child ceases acting as the primary provider of personal care services for the veteran or member; or, (bb) the date on which it is reasonably feasible, as so determined, for the child to initiate or resume the use of benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (h)(5)(B)(iii), (iv).

The facts in this case are not in dispute. The record shows that in June 2013, the Veteran transferred 36 months of entitlement to Chapter 33 benefits to her dependent, the appellant. A June 2015 Certificate of Eligibility explained to the appellant that she had 27 months and 8 days of full-time of transferred benefits remaining, and those benefits needed to be used prior to April 28, 2021, which was her 26th birthday. The record also shows that the appellant utilized these benefits towards an undergraduate degree. In December 2022, VA received another enrollment certification from her school. In the December 2022 administrative decision on appeal, the AOJ stated that she was not entitled to such benefits as the appellant's ending date was April 28, 2021. However, the administrative decision failed to explain that, per 38 U.S.C. § 3319 (h)(5)(A), that was the date of the appellant's 26th birthday and she was no longer eligible for Chapter 33 benefits.

In her March 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran asserts her Chapter 33 benefits do not expire due to the Forever GI Bill. In this regard, the Veteran is correct as she was last discharged from military service after January 1, 2013. However, as explained above, the appellant's deadline to use the transferred benefits was her 26th birthday. Notably, there is nothing in the record to show the Veteran or appellant contend that she was acting as a VA primary provider of personal care services for the Veteran. Thus,  the record shows that the appellant was not prevented from pursuing a chosen program of education by reason of acting as the primary provider of personal care services for the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 1720G prior to her 26th birthday.

While the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's belief that her education benefits would not expire, it is bound by the applicable law and regulations. In this case, there is, unfortunately, no legal basis for granting the benefits requested by the appellant.

Accordingly, entitlement to Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits through transfer of entitlement beyond April 28, 2021 must be denied as a matter of law. Where the law, rather than the facts, is dispositive, the benefit of the doubt provisions as set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b) (2012) do not apply. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
