ORDER

Entitlement to placement in a priority group status higher than priority group 3 for purposes of treatment in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have a singular or combined rating of 50 percent or greater based on one or more service connected disabilities or unemployability, he was not awarded the Medal of Honor, and he does not have a singular or combined rating of 30 percent or 40 percent based on one or more service connected disabilities.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to placement in a higher priority group for purposes of eligibility for enrollment in VA health care system have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1722; 38 C.F.R. § 17.36.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 1969 to August 1973.  

The decision on appeal was issued in June 2021 by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Eligibility Center (HEC).  In the September 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Generally, VA outlines eligibility for enrollment into the VA health care system in 38 U.S.C. § 1710.  Following an application for enrollment, Veterans are placed in priority groups. See 38 U.S.C. § 1722; 38 C.F.R. § 17.36; see generally https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/priority-groups/ (last accessed April 2, 2025).  

In his September 2021 VA Form 10182, the Veteran stated he was appealing his assigned priority group.  He advised he should be in priority group 6 because of his service in Vietnam.  The evidence of record reflects he is enrolled in priority group 3.  

In order to be eligible for priority group 1, the Veteran must have a service connected disability rated at 50 percent or greater based on one or more service connected disabilities or unemployability or be awarded the Medal of Honor.  To be eligible for priority group 2, the Veteran must have a singular or combined rating of 30 percent or 40 percent based on one or more service connected disabilities.  Priority group 3 requirements include: Veterans who are former prisoners of war (POWs); Veterans awarded the Purple Heart; Veterans with a singular or combined rating of 10 percent or 20 percent based on one or more service-connected disabilities; veterans who were discharged or released from active military service for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; veterans who receive disability compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151; Veterans whose entitlement to disability compensation is suspended pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1151, but only to the extent that such veterans' continuing eligibility for that care is provided for in the judgment or settlement described in 38 U.S.C. § 1151; Veterans whose entitlement to disability compensation is suspended because of the receipt of military retired pay; and Veterans receiving compensation at the 10 percent rating level based on multiple noncompensable service-connected disabilities that clearly interfere with normal employability.

There is no evidence of record that the Veteran meets any criteria for enrollment in priority group 1 or priority group 2.  The Veteran's DD-214 reports that for his meritorious service, the Veteran was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Air Force Good Conduct Medal.  Additionally, the evidence of record reflects the Veteran's combined evaluation for compensation is 10 percent.  Therefore, as the Veteran has a combined rating of 10 percent, he is appropriately placed in priority group 3.  

VA will reconsider enrollment status if criteria change.  However, this appeal for entitlement to a higher priority group cannot be granted, as the Veteran is ineligible under priority group 1 and priority group 2.

Accordingly, entitlement to placement in a priority group status higher than priority group 3 for treatment in the VA health care system is denied.

[The Board notes the HEC records reflect the Veteran is enrolled in priority group 3 with an enrollment effective date of September 7, 2022, this appeal does not affect or disrupt the Veteran's current enrollment status.]
