ORDER

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is aggravated by his service-connected sinusitis. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected sinusitis are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1989 to March 1993.

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, most recently addressed in a June 2023 rating decision. In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received, and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.   

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Specifically, the Board has considered evidence received prior to the March 25, 2024 rating decision. Any evidence submitted after March 25, 2024 is ineligible for review. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board acknowledges that in July 2023, VA received from the Veteran a Statement in Support of the Claim (VA Form 21-4138) which contained a hyperlink to content that is not otherwise part of the record on appeal; however, that content was not accessed nor considered as part of the record before the Board. See Bowey v. West, 11 Vet. App. 106, 108-09 (1998) (holding that the mere reference to non VA documents is insufficient to incorporate them into the record).

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

The Veteran contends that his obstructive sleep apnea is secondary to his service-connected sinusitis.  

Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc). Service connection on a secondary basis is warranted for any incremental increase in disability, regardless of its permanence. See Ward v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 233 (2019). Secondary service connection may be granted where a non-service-connected disability would have been less severe but for a service-connected disability. Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F. 4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (invalidating the requirement of "proximate cause" and instead held a "but for" causation or aggravation is enough to show entitlement to secondary service connection).

The Board initially notes that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis is not disputed. In its June 2023 rating decision, the AOJ noted amongst its favorable findings that the Veteran was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea at his September 2022 VA examination. 

The Veteran submitted a September 2022 correspondence from a physician's assistant at SSM Health Medical Group. The physician's assistant opined that the Veteran has obstructive sleep apnea secondary to chronic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis. The opinion was unaccompanied by a rationale. 

In July 2023, the Veteran resubmitted the September 2022  correspondence along with a Statement in Support of the Claim (VA Form 21-4138) in which he requested that the AOJ acknowledge the supporting medical literature. He referenced a National Institute of Health (NIH) article entitled "The linkage of allergic rhinitis and obstructive sleep apnea."  The Board notes however, that content was not accessed nor considered as part of the record before the Board. See Bowey v. West, 11 Vet. App. 106, 108-09 (1998) (holding that the mere reference to non VA documents is insufficient to incorporate them into the record).

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2022. The examiner opined that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was less likely than not (less than 50 percent probability) proximately due to or the result of his service-connected sinusitis. He explained that the Veteran had a high BMI of 34 at the time he underwent the sleep study. The examiner stated that excess weight is the strongest risk factor associated with obstructive sleep apnea due to obstruction of the upper airway while sleeping. He further stated that each unit increase in BMI is associated with a 14 percent increased risk of developing sleep apnea, and a 10 percent weight gain increases the odds of developing moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea by six times. The examiner stated that "there is no evidence in the literature to suggest that in the setting of a primary risk factor such as high BMI that sinusitis would be the primary cause of obstructive symptoms. Sinusitis certainly can exacerbate OSA based on the literature, but with the Veteran's high risk BMI it would not be the primary risk factor in causation."

As noted above, in Spicer, the Court invalidated the requirement of "proximate cause" and instead held a "but for" causation or aggravation is enough to show entitlement to secondary service connection. The September 2022 VA examiner's unfavorable opinion regarding whether there is proximate causation appears to require a greater level of causation than that is legally required. It is sufficient that, as the examiner indicated, the Veteran's sleep apnea is exacerbated by his service-connected sinusitis.  Or in other words, that his service-connected sinusitis is a factor in exacerbating or worsening his sleep apnea. Furthermore, it is not required that the Veteran show his service-connected sinusitis was the 'primary' causative factor (as opposed to something else) when attempting to establish secondary service connection.  The Court in Allen explained that "aggravation" in the context of § 1110 differs from that pertaining to §1153. The Allen Court stated that "aggravation" in § 1110 defined a more general meaning encompassing "any increase in disability." Consequently, the Board finds the unfavorable nexus opinion rendered by the September 2022 VA examiner actually lends support to the Veteran's claim when it is viewed holistically and in a light most favorable to the Veteran. Specifically, in this regard, the examiner has acknowledged that sinusitis certainly can exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea based on the literature reviewed.  The Board recognizes that the September 2022 VA examiner's speculative language ("certainly can") is generally insufficient to support a claim. See Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30, 33 (1993). However, this opinion, which by the examiner's own admission is supported by the relevant medical literature, is further also supported by the favorable September 2022 private medical opinion. The Board finds that these opinions when considered together are sufficient to put the matter at issue - causal nexus - in approximate balance.

Because the Board finds the evidence to at least be in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is caused or aggravated by his service-connected sinusitis, it will resolve reasonable doubt in his favor and that service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 310.
