REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with recurrent subluxation is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had one period of active, honorable military service from August 1987 to September 1990. He also had a second period of military service from January 1995 to September 1995, which was deemed dishonorable for Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) purposes. 

By way of history, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Benefits in May 2022. He sought increased ratings for his right knee disabilities based on recurrent subluxation, limitation of flexion, and limitation of extension. Later that month, he was notified that his application was incomplete because it was missing a page, and he was asked to resubmit the completed form. The Veteran subsequently submitted a completed VA Form 21-526EZ in June 2022. 

In March 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision in response to the Veteran's June 2022 claim. This decision increased the rating assigned for the Veteran's right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with limitation of extension to 30 percent effective April 14, 2022. It also decreased the ratings assigned for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with recurrent subluxation and limitation of flexion to noncompensable ratings from March 9, 2023. 

Another rating decision was issued in April 2023 following a special review of the Veteran's file. This decision found that a clear and unmistakable error was found in the evaluation assigned for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with limitation of extension. The evaluation of this disability was proposed to be decreased to 20 percent for the period from April 14, 2022 to May 11, 2022, and then an evaluation of 30 percent was proposed to be assigned effective May 11, 2022. The AOJ also found a clear and unmistakable error in the evaluation assigned for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with recurrent subluxation, and a 20 percent evaluation was restored. Finally, a clear and unmistakable error was found in the effective date assigned for the noncompensable evaluation assigned for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with limitation of flexion, and a noncompensable evaluation was proposed to be established from June 22, 2022. 

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). He stated that he was appealing "the decision made on [the] evaluation of patellofemoral pain syndrome." It is unclear exactly which issues the Veteran intended to appeal in this VA Form 10182. However, because the decisions regarding the evaluations assigned for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with limitation of extension and flexion were merely proposed ratings, they were not appealable at the time of the April 2023 rating decision. Rather, these issues were not finally decided until a July 2023 rating decision, which was issued well after the VA Form 10182 was received. Thus, the only appealable issue in the April 2023 rating decision was the restoration of the 20 percent rating for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with recurrent subluxation. The April 2023 VA Form 10182 is therefore interpreted to be seeking a rating in excess of 20 percent for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with recurrent subluxation. 

In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with recurrent subluxation, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

VA regulations require that the Board contact an appellant and request clarification if the Board cannot identify which review option an appellant intends to select. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f). Furthermore, a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) may be unclear if an appellant attaches evidence to a NOD indicating that the appellant is seeking Direct Review, as evidence submitted along with a NOD may not be considered by the Board under that review option. See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023). 

In the instant appeal, the Veteran submitted argument along with the VA Form 10182, to include argument that there were errors in the processing of his claims. These contentions are posited as errors in the application of the law and are properly before the Board, as they are not new evidence. The present appeal is therefore factually distinguishable from Edwards, and the Board can proceed with a decision without clarifying the Veteran's intent pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f). 

Finally, the Board notes that the Veteran's attorney attempted to withdraw from representation in this appeal after the appeal was certified to the Board. Under VA regulation, when a request to withdraw is received after the appeal is certified to the Board, the representative is obligated to present a motion to the Board in writing, demonstrating good cause to withdraw as the Veteran's representative. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.6(a)(2) (effective February 19, 2019) (formerly 38 C.F.R. § 20.608 (2018)). Good cause for such purposes is the extended illness or incapacitation of the representative of the representative, the failure of the appellant to cooperate with proper preparation and presentation of the appeal, or other factors which make the continuation of representation impossible, impractical, or unethical. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.6(a)(2). 

Here, the attorney submitted a cancellation of limited power of attorney in February 2024. He simply stated that he revoked power of attorney for this Veteran. This attempted withdrawal fails to comply with the requirements set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 20.6(a)(2) for a post-certification withdrawal of representation. He has not presented any good cause for this attempted withdrawal of representation, nor did he actually file a motion to withdraw as the Veteran's representative. Given this, the Board concludes that the Veteran's attorney, John S. Berry, continues to represent the Veteran in this matter. 

Entitlement to a Rating in Excess of 20 Percent for Right Knee Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome with Recurrent Subluxation

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a 20 percent rating for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with recurrent subluxation. 

One of the effects of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) is to narrow the set of circumstances in which the Board must remand appeals to the AOJ for further development instead of immediately deciding them directly. However, the Board has the duty to remand issues when necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error where the issues cannot be granted in full. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

In his June 2022 application for benefits, the Veteran indicated that he was receiving treatment from Merit Health Wesley. He submitted a VA Form 21-4142a, General Release for Medical Provider Information to the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA), in July 2022, again indicating that he was receiving treatment from Merit Health Wesley. He stated that this provider was a VA medical satellite. Indeed, the Veteran's VA treatment records show that he received treatment and testing, including a right knee MRI, at Merit Health Wesley through the VA Choice program. While some records from Merit Health Wesley are included in the Veteran's claims file, they appear to be incomplete, as they do not include records of the September 2021 MRI of the right knee. 

The Veteran's treatment records from the VA Choice/Community Care program are within VA's constructive possession and must be obtained regardless of their relevance as long as they are sufficiently identified. Sullivan v. McDonald, 315 F.3d 786, 793 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (holding VA has the duty to assist in obtaining sufficiently identified VA medical records regardless of their relevance); see also Jones v. Wilkie, 918 F.3d 922 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (confirming the holding in Sullivan). 

In sum, it was a pre-decisional duty to assist error in not obtaining the Veteran's records from treatment through the VA Choice program at Merit Health Wesley. Remand is therefore required for the AOJ to undertake the necessary efforts to associate these treatment records with the claims file. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain the Veteran's VA treatment records for treatment through the VA Choice/Community Care program at Merit Wesley Health, to include records of the September 2021 MRI of his right knee.
