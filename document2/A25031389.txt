FINDING OF FACT

A disability rating of 10 percent for hemorrhoids was not factually ascertainable prior to March 17, 2023. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than March 17, 2023, for the award of a 10 percent rating for hemorrhoids have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7336.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1989 to August 1999, and from November 2006 to November 2007. 

This matter is on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision. 

Initially, in an August 2022 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection with a noncompensable rating for the Veteran's hemorrhoids claim and denied service connection for his remaining claims.  The Veteran filed a supplemental claim in November 2022.  With a supplemental claim, new and relevant evidence (NRE) is required.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a).  In the June 2023 supplemental claim rating decision, the AOJ determined new and relevant evidence had not been received to adjudicate any of the claims.  In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a Higher Level Review (HLR) request.  In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of the record at the time of the prior June 2023 rating decision.  While the AOJ did not specifically state NRE was received, the AOJ did readjudicate the claims on the merits, thus, the Board concludes there was an implicit finding of NRE by the AOJ.  The Board is bound by these?prior favorable findings that NRE was received sufficient to readjudicate the claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

In a December 2023 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, with respect to the remanded the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

An effective date earlier than March 17, 2023, for the award of a 10 percent rating for hemorrhoids.

Legal Criteria 

The effective date of an award based on an original claim shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 1999).

An effective date for increased disability compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred, if application is received within one year from such date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  "[A]n increase in a veteran's service-connected disability must have occurred during the one-year period prior to the date of the veteran's claim in order to receive the benefit of an earlier effective date." Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (discussing 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)).  If the increase in disability is shown to have occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b) (2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (1998).

An effective date for an increased rating should not be assigned mechanically based on the date of an examination.  Rather, all of the facts should be examined to determine the date that the disability first manifested.  Accordingly, the effective date for an increased rating as well as for an initial rating or for staged ratings is predicated on when the increase in the level of disability can be ascertained.  Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015).

In determining when an increase is "factually ascertainable," all of the evidence must be looked to, including testimonial evidence and expert medical opinions, and an effective date must be assigned based on that evidence.  See McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35-36 (2000); VAOPGCPREC 12-98.  Thus, "it is the information in a medical opinion, and not the date the medical opinion [that] was provided that is relevant when assigning an effective date."  Tatum v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 139, 145 (2010).

Ratings are based on a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries.  The ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3. 

The Veteran's hemorrhoids are evaluated under DC 7336.  

Under DC 7336, hemorrhoids that are mild or moderate are assigned a noncompensable (zero percent) rating.  Hemorrhoids that are large or thrombotic, irreducible, with excessive redundant tissue, evidencing frequent recurrences are assigned a 10 percent rating.  Hemorrhoids with persistent bleeding and with secondary anemia, or with fissures are assigned a 20 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114.

Analysis 

On October 13, 2021, VA received the Veteran's intent to file a claim for compensation.  In February 2022, the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for hemorrhoids.  In an August 2022 rating decision, the RO granted the claim with a noncompensable rating, effective October 13, 2021, the date VA received the Veteran's intent to file.  The Veteran submitted a November 2022 supplemental claim application seeking a higher initial rating for his hemorrhoids claim.  In a June 2023 rating decision, the RO granted the Veteran's increased rating claim, assigning a 10 percent rating effective March 17, 2023, the date of the Veteran's most recent VA examination.  The Veteran submitted a July 2023 request for HLR, seeking an earlier effective date for the 10 percent assigned rating of October 13, 2021, the date of his intent to file a claim.  In a November 2023 rating decision, the RO denied the claim.  The Veteran then filed the present appeal for an earlier effective date.  

The Veteran contends that the effective date of his 10 percent rating for his hemorrhoids should be October 13, 2021, the date VA received his intent to file a claim.  See November 2022 Veteran Correspondence. 

In the June 2023 rating decision, the RO granted the Veteran's increased rating claim, assigning a 10 percent rating effective March 17, 2023, the date of the Veteran's most recent VA examination.  Previously, the Veteran was assigned a noncompensable rating effective October 13, 2021, the date VA received his intent to file a claim.  

The evidence of record includes a July 2022 VA examination.  The examiner noted internal or external hemorrhoids.  The Veteran reported experiencing occasional flare-ups, resulting in pain, discomfort, and itchiness in the anal region.  The examiner did not indicate that the Veteran's hemorrhoids were large or thrombotic, irreducible, with excessive redundant tissue, evidencing frequent recurrences.  Nor did the examiner find evidence of persistent bleeding with secondary anemia, or fissures.  

The Board finds that the July 2022 examination tends to show that the Veteran was not having increased symptomatology at the time.  Rather, the Veteran's symptomatology aligns with the noncompensable rating that the Veteran received after his claim of service connection was granted.  As such, the July 2022 examination does not show that a 10 percent rating was factually ascertainable prior to the March 17, 2023, effective date. 

The Veteran was also receiving private treatment for his hemorrhoids prior to the March 17, 2023, effective date.  In October 2022, the Veteran sought private treatment for rectal pain.  The private clinician noted external hemorrhoids without bleeding or ulcers.  The Veteran also denied bleeding but indicated his hemorrhoid symptoms were mild with pain and itching.  

The Board finds that the October 2022 private treatment records tend to align with the findings of the July 2022 VA examination.  Although the Veteran's private treatment records show that he was experiencing symptomatology prior to the March 17, 2023, effective date of a 10 percent rating, the Veteran was not experiencing increased symptomatology at the time.  Rather, the Veteran's symptomatology corresponds to the noncompensable rating he was receiving at the time.  As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's private treatment records do not show that a 10 percent rating was factually ascertainable prior to March 17, 2023.  

In March 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with the claim, which his 10 percent rating increase was predicated upon.  Although outside the temporal period on review, the Veteran reported experiencing flare-ups where his hemorrhoids become inflamed, resulting in itchiness and a burning sensation.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had large external hemorrhoids.  The examiner did not find evidence of persistent bleeding and with secondary anemia, or fissures.  The Veteran reported that his symptoms have worsened over time, however, it is unclear when the Veteran's increased symptomatology occurred.  Rather, the Board finds that the Veteran's dated VA examination and private treatment records more accurately reflect the Veteran's health during the one-year look back period prior to March 17, 2023.  Moreover, as discussed above, the Veteran's VA examination and private treatment records do not reflect that increase occurred within the one-year lookback period.  Overall, the evidentiary record does not show that a 10 percent rating was factually ascertainable prior to March 17, 2023. 

Accordingly, the persuasive evidence is against the claim; thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Therefore, an earlier effective date is not warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for a neck condition. 

Entitlement to service connection for left upper extremity radiculopathy.

Entitlement to service connection for a lower back condition.

The Veteran contends that he has neck and back conditions related to active duty.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that his neck and back pain started in service because of the constant demanding physical training.  The Veteran indicated that his required annual physical fitness tests (PFTs) and combat fitness tests (CFTs) caused intense and repetitive pain to his neck and back.  The Veteran reported completing "old school" sit-ups with his hands interlocked behind the head and neck.  The Veteran also stated that his CFTs required him to sprint 880 yards in boots and trousers, lift a thirty-pound ammo can over his head for two minutes, a shuffle event which required dragging a comrade and lifting them over his shoulder for a seventy-yard run, and then completing a seventy-five-yard run carrying two, thirty-pound ammo cans.  The Veteran stated that his neck and back pain has continued since service.  See November 2022 Correspondence.  

The Veteran also contends that he has left upper extremity radiculopathy secondary to his neck condition.  See July 2022 VA examination.  

Initially, in the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has intervertebral disc syndrome of the cervical spine, as well as degenerative disc disease of the thoracolumbar spine.  The Veteran's July 2022 VA neck and back examinations show diagnoses of intervertebral disc syndrome, spinal stenosis, and cervical radiculopathy, as well as degenerative disc disease with lumbar radiculopathy.  The RO also confirmed that the Veteran has left upper extremity cervical radiculopathy.  The Veteran's July 2022 VA examination shows a diagnosis of left upper extremity radiculopathy.  The AOJ also favorably found that the Veteran's left upper extremity radiculopathy is due to the Veteran's non-service-connected neck disability.  The Board is bound by these?prior favorable findings, which were not clearly and unmistakably erroneous.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

In July 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA back examination.  The diagnosis was degenerative disc disease with lumbar radiculopathy.  The Veteran reported that his lower back pain started during active duty around 1996 and attributes his pain to strenuous activity while in-service.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's claimed condition was less likely than not related to service because although the Veteran's post-service treatment records from 2015 indicate treatment for lower back pain, the Veteran's service treatment records are silent for complaints or treatment, and thus, no nexus is established.  

The Veteran was also afforded a July 2022 VA neck examination.  The diagnosis was intervertebral disc syndrome, spinal stenosis, and crevicular radiculopathy.  The Veteran reported that his neck pain started in service and attributes the pain to strenuous activity while in service.  The Veteran also reported experiencing ongoing symptoms.  The Veteran was also afforded a July 2022 VA opinion for his left upper extremity radiculopathy claim.  The diagnosis was left upper radiculopathy.  The Veteran reported an onset of 2020 for neck pain radiating to his left upper extremity causing tingling and numbing to the fingers.  In a joint opinion for this neck condition and left upper extremity radiculopathy, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's neck pain was less likely than not related to service because although the Veteran's post-service treatment records indicate treatment for neck pain that radiates down his left arm, the Veteran's service treatment records are silent for complaints or treatment for neck pain, and thus, no nexus is established.  

The Board finds the July 2022 opinions inadequate to decide the claim.  First, both examiners failed to consider the Veteran's assertions that this neck and lower back pain started during active duty from strenuous activity.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32?Vet. App.?249, 254 (2020); see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?23, 39 (2007) (finding that an examiner impermissibly ignored the appellant's lay assertions).   Additionally, the July 2022 examiners impermissibly relied on an absence of documented evidence during service without explaining why, as a medical matter, the Veteran would have sought treatment or complained of the condition during service, or why an absence of documented treatment or symptoms (as opposed to undocumented symptoms) was otherwise medically significant.  See McKinney v. McDonald, 28?Vet. App.?15, 30 (2016); Fountain v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?258, 272-75 (2015); Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24?Vet. App.?221, 223-24 (2011).  Lastly, the opinions are conclusory without rationale.   

Therefore, the July 2022 examiners' failure to consider the Veteran's lay assertions of the onset and continuity of symptoms, and impermissible reliance on the absence of documented evidence constitutes pre-decisional duty to assist errors and renders the opinions inadequate. 

The Board notes that the Veteran also submitted two private opinions.  In an October 2021 private treatment record, the Veteran's clinician indicated that the moderate to severe degenerative changes to his cervical spine were likely due to excessive wear from his military service.  Similarly, an October 2022 private clinician concluded that the Veteran's degenerative disc disease of the cervical and lumbar spine is more likely than not related to service.  The clinician indicated that the conclusion was based upon review of medical records, radiographic studies, and sub-specialist reports.  The Board also finds the private opinions not wholly adequate to decide the claim.  Although the basis of the private clinicians' opinions are predicated on the direct treatment of the Veteran, the provided opinions are conclusory without an adequate rationale.  As such, the Board cannot rely on the private opinions for adjudicative purposes.

However, remand is still required to correct the VA pre-decisional duty to assist errors and to afford the Veteran adequate VA examinations and opinions.  38 C.F.R. §?20.802(a). 

As the Veteran's neck condition is being reexamined on remand, and his left upper extremity radiculopathy claim is intertwined with his neck condition given the RO favorably finding that his left upper extremity radiculopathy is due to his neck disability, the Veteran's left upper extremity radiculopathy will also be remanded. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriately qualified clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's diagnosed neck and lower back conditions.  The examiner should review the entire claims file and this remand in conjunction with the examinations. 

The examiner should state whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's neck and lower back conditions had an onset during service or are etiologically related to service.

The examiner should consider and address the Veteran's lay assertions that his neck and lower back pain started in service from strenuous physical activity and has continued since service. 

The examiner should not rely on silence in the medical records unless it can be explained: (a) why the silence in the available records can be taken as proof that the symptoms did not occur, including why the fact would have normally been recorded if present, or (b) why the absence of medical records is medically significant. 

A rationale should be provided for opinions expressed.  If an opinion cannot be offered without resorting to speculation, the reason for this should be fully explained in the opinion.
