DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of November 22, 2021, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is granted.

Entitlement to an evaluation of 100 percent for CML for the period prior to March 1, 2025, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed an intent to file a claim on November 22, 2021; followed by a timely fully developed claim for entitlement to service connection for CML.

2. An August 2022 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for CML.  The Veteran subsequently submitted a supplemental claim within one year of that initial denial.  The current appeal is a continuation of that claim.

3. Prior to March 1, 2025, the Veteran's CML manifested symptoms requiring peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cell transplant, or continuous myelosuppressive or immunosuppressive therapy treatment.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of November 22, 2021, for service connection for CML have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.1, 3.2500, 3.2501.

2. For the period prior to March 1, 2025, the criteria for a 100 percent evaluation for CML have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.117, Diagnostic Code 7719.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from July 2002 to January 2019.  His awards and decorations include the Combat Action Badge. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued on September 29, 2023, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for CML most recently addressed in an August 2022 rating decision.  On September 21, 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and granted the claim and assigned an effective date of August 10, 2022.  

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) Claim Accuracy Request, and requested review of a September 21, 2023, decision, contending VA erred by failing to consider the entire period of the appeal (as the September 21, 2023, decision had granted a 100 percent rating for the Veteran's CML, effective August 10, 2022). On September 29, 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the September 29, 2023, HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 21, 2023, decision. The September 29, 2023, HLR decision denied an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for CML and denied an increased evaluation for CML.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 21, 2023, AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date of November 22, 2021, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for CML

As discussed above, in a September 21, 2023, rating decision, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for CML was granted and an effective date of August 10, 2022 was assigned.  The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection. 

Generally, the effective date of service connection based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. An exception is that the day following the date of separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose controls if the claim is received within one year after separation from active service; otherwise, the general rule applies. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). Claim means a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. 38?C.F.R. § 3.1(p). An initial claim is any complete claim, other than a supplemental claim, for a benefit on a form prescribed by the Secretary. The first initial claim for one or more benefits received by VA is further defined as an original claim. 38?C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(1)(i). Initial claims include a new claim requesting service connection for a disability. Id. 

Except as specifically provided, the effective date of a rating and award for pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For continuously pursued or supplemental claims, the effective dates are governed by 38?C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

A claim, for VA compensation purposes, is broadly defined to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-5 (1998). Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.

There was an attempt to eliminate ITFs during AMA; however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit invalidated this elimination and IFTs are still in operation. See Military Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021), (invalidating § 3.155 in part to the extent it excludes AMA supplemental claims from the intent to file framework). 

Here, in a November 2021 correspondence, VA acknowledged receipt of the Veteran's Intent to File a Claim on November 22, 2021.  On April 28, 2022, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim seeking service connection for CML.  In an August 2022 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim.  The Veteran was notified of procedure and appeal rights in an August 2022 letter.

In July 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 supplemental claim to have the August 2022 denial of his claim for service connection for CML reviewed.  In a September 21, 2023, rating decision, the AOJ granted the Veteran service connection for CML and assigned an effective date of August 10, 2022.

After careful consideration, the Board thus concludes that the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date of November 22, 2021, for the award of service connection for CML. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three elements: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after separation when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

In this case, private treatment records received by VA in June 2022 reveal that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of CML, with the onset noted as July 2021.  A private medical opinion from July 2023 determined that the Veteran's CML is caused by the Veteran's exposure to benzene during his active military service.  This means the date of diagnosis was July 2021, prior to the claim being filed.

The Board finds that an effective date of November 22, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for CML is warranted.  The earlier August 2022 denial of service connection did not become final because the Veteran filed a valid supplemental claim within one year of that decision, there has been continuous pursuit of the claim.  38?C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  As such, the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim since November 22, 2022.  Id. Moreover, there are no documents which can be construed as a claim for service connection for CML prior to November 22, 2021.  Therefore, even if entitlement arose prior to November 22, 2022, the date of claim is still the later of the two dates and therefore the correct effective date.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Accordingly, in compliance with VA laws and regulations regarding earlier effective dates for the award of service connection, entitlement to an earlier effective date of November 22, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for CML is granted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400.

2. Entitlement to a 100 percent evaluation for CML for the period prior to March 1, 2025. 

As an initial matter, the Board notes the legal finding that in a December 2024 rating decision, the AOJ effectuated a reduction in the Veteran's disability evaluation for CML from 100 percent to 60 percent effective March 1, 2025.  This matter has not been appealed to the Board and is not the subject of this decision.  As of this writing, the Veteran still has time to appeal and can follow the instructions on the appeal rights given with the December 2024 decision in a December 31, 2024, notice letter if the Veteran chooses to do so.

The Veteran's CML is currently rated as 100 percent disabling for the period from August 10, 2022, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.117, Diagnostic Code 7719.  In light of the legal determination in the December 2024 rating decision, the Board will characterize this appeal as pertaining to entitlement to a 100 percent evaluation for CML for the entire period prior to March 1, 2025.  

Under Diagnostic Code 7719 for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (chronic myeloid leukemia or chronic granulocytic leukemia), a 30 percent rating is warranted if the condition is in apparent remission on continuous molecularly targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Requiring intermittent myelosuppressive therapy, or molecularly targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or interferon treatment when not in apparent remission warrants a 60 percent rating. Requiring peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cell transplant, or continuous myelosuppressive or immunosuppressive therapy treatment warrants a 100 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.117, Diagnostic Code 7719.

In June 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination.  A diagnosis of CML was confirmed.  The examiner noted that continuous medication was required for control of the CML.  The Veteran's CML was characterized as active, which was noted to be actively treated with therapeutic prescription medication.  Specifically, the Veteran's CML was noted to require continuous immunosuppressive therapy treatment.  

In September 2023, another VA examination was conducted.  Diagnoses of CML and microcytic anemia were rendered.  The examiner noted that continuous medication is required for the Veteran's disorders.  A status of active disorder was noted.  Further, the examiner found that the Veteran's CML required continuous myelosuppressive therapy.  

Based on the evidence described above, the Board finds that for the entire period prior to March 1, 2025, the Veteran's CML required continuous myelosuppressive therapy treatment.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the criteria for a 100 percent evaluation for the entire period prior to March 1, 2025, is met, and the Veteran's claim for an increased evaluation must be granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
