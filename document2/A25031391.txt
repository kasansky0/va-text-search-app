ORDER

A total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to a service-connected disability (TDIU) is granted.

Service connection for the Veteran's cause of death is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) precluded him from obtaining or maintaining substantially gainful employment.

2. The Veteran's Certification of Death lists hypertension among the conditions causing his death.

3. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the appellant's favor, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran's hypertension manifested to a compensable degree within one year of his separation from his second period of active service in January 2008.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

2. The criteria for service connection for cause of death have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1310, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.312.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1996 to May 2000 and August 2002 to January 2008. The Veteran passed away in July 2020. The appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse has been granted substitution as the claimant.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of two rating decisions issued in October 2020 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Board received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), in June 2021. The Evidence Submission docket was selected. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the AOJ issued the respective October 2020 rating decisions, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant or her representative with, or within 90 days from, the Board's receipt of the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. 

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the two October 2020 rating decisions on appeal and prior to the Board's receipt of June VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the Board's receipt of the June 2021 VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300; 20.303, 20.801.

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ the respective  two October 2020 rating decisions on appeal and prior to the Board's receipt of June 2021 VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the Board's receipt of the June 2021 VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300; 20.303, 20.801.

TDIU

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. 

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018) (combining disabilities as "one disability" to meet the rating threshold of § 4.16(a) requires the use of the combined rating table). 

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the United States Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) defined the phrase "employment in a protected environment" within 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) to unambiguously mean "a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 113 (2024). The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. Ray, 31 Vet. App. at 73-74. Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Id.

An award of a TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training. See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Court has held that the central inquiry in determining whether a Veteran is entitled to TDIU is whether service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability. Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524 (1993). The test of individual unemployability is whether a veteran, because of his service-connected disabilities alone, is unable to secure or follow any form of substantially gainful occupation which is consistent with his education and occupational experience. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. The sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough. The ultimate question is whether the veteran can perform the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993). The question of whether a veteran is capable of substantial gainful employment is not a medical one; rather, that determination is for the adjudicator. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

The issue of entitlement to a TDIU. 

The Veteran prior to his death contended that he is entitled to a TDIU because he could not work due to his service-connected PTSD. See July 2020 VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. Specifically, he asserted that he left his last job because of panic attacks, severe anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and depression. Further he stated that he could not be in a crowd of people because he could not handle it and that he did not trust people. For the following reasons, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD rendered him unable to obtain or maintain a substantially gainful occupation.

At the time of his death, the Veteran was service connected for a single disability, his PTSD. His PTSD was rated at 70 percent from July 2017. Accordingly, the percentage criteria for consideration of entitlement to a TDIU on a schedular basis is met. 

In his July 2020 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported that he last worked in April 2017. He last worked 40 hours per week in a warehouse from November 2016 to April 2017. A July 2017 VA treatment record documented his report that he lost his job as a forklift operator in June and was actively searching for a job. Prior to that, his VA treatment records indicate he worked as a correctional officer for about a year and a half. 

A review of his VA treatment records shows that the Veteran participated in a VA's Grant and Per Diem (GPD) program from September 2017 to August 2018. During that time, he completed heavy equipment operator school. At the time of his discharge from the GPD, it was noted that he had no hours of competitive employment during his participation in the program and that at the time of his discharge his employment plan upon exit was to continue as a student at an aviation institute. 

It is unclear whether the Veteran was able to obtain employment upon discharge from the GPD. A February 2018 VA treatment record documented his report that he was technically employed part-time for a construction company, but had not worked due to the winter weather and last worked on a job in December. No further information is of record regarding his part-time employment in construction. Thus, the Board is unable to determine whether he was able to make more than the poverty threshold from his part-time employment in construction. A June 6, 2019, VA treatment record indicated he was unemployed while a June 26, 2019, VA treatment record indicated that he was employed without further information regarding the nature of his employment.  

Considering the above, the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in the appellant's favor and finds that the Veteran was not substantially gainfully employed throughout the period on review leading up to his death. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

In terms of his functional impairments due to his PTSD, following a November 2018 VA PTSD examination, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's PTSD would result in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and/or mood. The examiner stated that his relevant symptoms were depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occurred weekly or less often, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficultly adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting), suicidal ideation, obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities, as well as intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (to include maintenance of minimal personal hygiene). Generally, the examiner noted that the PTSD diagnostic criteria included problems with concentration. 

With respect to the Veteran's education and training, in his July 2020 VA Form 21-8940, he reported only having a high school level education. 

In view of the above, the Veteran's employment history was limited to positions which would require him to interact with supervisors and coworkers as well as customers potentially. Further, his employment history was limited to positions which presumably required unimpaired concentration as he was either operating a forklift or working in construction. There is no indication of record that the additional training he obtained through the GPD through the heavy equipment operator school would have helped him to develop skills to work in a position with minimal or no interaction with supervisors, coworkers, or customers, nor in an office or office-like setting that did not required the operation of heavy machinery, such as a forklift.

Given that the PTSD symptoms identified by the VA examiner and the Veteran's lay report of the impact of those symptoms on which ability to work, the Board finds that his PTSD symptomatology prevented him from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment throughout the period on review. Significantly, he would have had difficulty interacting with supervisors, coworkers, or customers, and he would likely had have had difficulty safely performing his work duties as he was unable to concentrate due to his disturbances of motivation and mood and suicidal ideation.

In sum, after affording the appellant the benefit of the doubt, upon consideration of the Veteran's PTSD symptomatology and his employment history, education, and training, the Board finds that he was precluded from obtaining or maintaining substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected PTSD. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Accordingly, entitlement to a TDIU is granted. 

Service Connection

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1310, dependency indemnity compensation (DIC) is paid to a surviving spouse of a qualifying veteran who died from a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1310(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.5(a)(1).

Service connection may be established for a disability that caused the veteran's death either principally or contributorily. 38 U.S.C. § 1310 ; 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(a). A principal cause of death is one which, either singly or jointly with another condition, was the immediate or underlying cause of death or was otherwise etiologically related thereto. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(b). Whereas a contributory cause of death is one that contributed substantially or materially to cause death, combined to cause death, or aided or lent assistance to the production of death.

Determining whether the disability that resulted in the death of a veteran was the result of active service is based on the same statutory and regulatory scheme which governs service connection for a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active-duty service, which is set forth below.

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Generally, in order to establish service connection, there must be competent and credible evidence demonstrating: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus or link between the in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for certain chronic diseases, to include hypertension, if there is competent and credible evidence demonstrating that (1) the chronic disease was shown as such in service or within the one year presumptive period under § 3.307(a)(3) and the same chronic disease manifests at any later date, however remote, unless it is clearly attributable to intercurrent causes; (2) it manifested to a compensable degree within one year presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3); or (3) if the condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, continuity of symptomatology after discharge from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a), 3.309(a); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Under Diagnostic Code 7101, 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, hypertension is a disability for VA compensation purposes when the diastolic pressure is predominantly 90mm or greater or isolated systolic pressure is predominantly 160mm or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm. 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021) (en banc).

The issue of entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's cause of death.

The appellant seeks service connection for the Veteran's cause of death. Specifically, the appellant contends that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD caused his hypertension which led to the development of his coronary heart disease. See October 2020 VA Form 21-534 EZ Application for DIC, Survivors Pension and Accrued Benefits. For the following reasons, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for the Veteran's cause of death.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran's Certification of Death notes that hypertension among his causes of death, along with probably cardiac arrhythmia due to coronary heart disease and coronary heart disease. The Veteran was not service connected for any of the causes of death listed at the time of his death. Thus, the inquiry for the Board is whether any of the Veteran's causes of death were incurred in or otherwise caused by his active service or whether his service-connected PTSD contributed substantially or materially to cause his death.

Here, a review of the Veteran's service treatment record shows that despite elevated blood pressure readings at various times during his active service, he was never diagnosed with hypertension in service. Notably, an April 2003 Chronological Record of Medical Care specifically noted an assessment of elevated blood pressure reading without a diagnosis of hypertension along with a diagnosis of strep pharyngitis. 

The earliest documented diagnosis of hypertension of record is from March 2009. See March 2009 FHC Treatment Record. However, at that time, it was noted that the Veteran had been prescribed two different medications to control his hypertension, which included Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). A review of a FHC Continuing Medication List indicates that HCTZ was prescribed as early as February 2008 and Lisinopril was prescribed in November 2008. 

Given the above, the evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension withing one year of his separation from his second period of active duty service and that it had manifested to a compensable degree as he required continuous medication to control it. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. As noted above, hypertension is among the chronic diseases eligible for presumptive service connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3). As the evidence establishes that it manifested to a compensable degree within one year of the Veteran's separation from his second period of active duty service, the Board finds that his hypertension was due to his service. Thus, his death was caused by disability due to his service. Accordingly, service connection for the Veteran's cause of death is warranted.
