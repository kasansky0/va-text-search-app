REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from February 1996 to October 1996, June 2007 to August 2008, and August 2011 to October 2012 with additional service in the National Guard. 

In a September 2023 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claims.  In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 2023 decision.  In February 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2023 decision.  In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151

The Veteran contends that he has diabetes that was caused by VA care.  

To obtain compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151, a claimant must show a "qualifying additional disability" resulting from VA treatment or hospitalization.  The proximate or direct cause of the "additional disability" must be (1) carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of VA in furnishing medical or surgical treatment or (2) an event which was not reasonably foreseeable.  38 U.S.C. § 1151; 38 C.F.R. § 3.361.

To determine whether additional disability exists, the veteran's condition immediately prior to the beginning of the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, training and rehabilitation services, or compensated work therapy program upon which the claim is based is compared to his or her condition after such care, treatment, examination, services, or program has been completed.  Each body part or system involved is considered separately.  3 8 C.F.R. § 3.361(b).

A January 2016 VA treatment record reports diagnosis of "hyperglycemia - possible due to nonfasting labs."  A recheck in three to four months was ordered.  A March 2016 VA treatment record reports that the hyperglycemia was resolved.  Subsequent treatment records in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 also report that the hyperglycemia was resolved.  

A May 2022 VA medical record reveals a finding of impaired fasting glucose.  Subsequent VA medical records reveal the Veteran's history that he was told he had pre-diabetes.  A July 2023 VA examination record reveals the examiner's determination that there was not an official diagnosis of diabetes.  The examiner noted the Veteran's medical history, including the finding of pre-diabetes in May 2022, and determined the Veteran had not been diagnosed with diabetes.  

After consideration of the record, the Board finds the record does not support the finding that the Veteran has diabetes as an "additional disability" as defined by VA as a result of VA treatment.  Notably, the record is absent a current diagnosis of diabetes.  A finding of "impaired fasting glucose" or pre-diabetes or hyperglycemia is not a disability for VA purposes (service connection or compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151); elevated blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) represent a laboratory finding, and therefore are not considered to be an actual disability in and of itself for which VA compensation benefits are payable.  See 61 Fed. Reg. 20,440, 20,445 (May 7, 1996) (Diagnoses of hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, and elevated cholesterol are actually laboratory results and are not, in and of themselves, disabilities.).  Accordingly, compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 is not warranted due to lack of an additional disability.    

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a VA compensation claim.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997).  In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the requirement of a current disability is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or proximate thereto.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that symptoms causing functional impairment may be considered a disability even in the absence of a diagnosed condition.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-68 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  However, to establish the presence of a disability, a veteran will need to show that his symptoms reach the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity.  Id.

Service connection is not warranted for diabetes, radiculopathy, or plantar fasciitis.  As discussed above, the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of diabetes.  The Board has also carefully reviewed the evidence of record and finds no probative diagnosis of radiculopathy or other generalized neurological disorder of the upper or lower extremities or plantar fasciitis during the period of the claim.  There is also no findings or histories of these claimed disorders in the medical records during the period of the claim, and the Veteran has not reported the existence of outstanding records.  The Veteran has also not provided any additional information, such as when the conditions occurred, which the Board could interpret as competent evidence of current (i.e., during the pendency of the claim) disability.  

The Board acknowledges that the record reveals history of heel pain and treatment for plantar fasciitis from October 2010 to April 2011.  The condition was determined to be improving in May 2011 and was reported to be resolved (i.e. painfree) by July 2011, however, and was no longer listed as an active diagnosis from September 2015.  Plantar fasciitis is not a chronic disorder per 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), and the record indicates that it resolved by 2015.  Accordingly, the claims for service connection must be denied.
