FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran separated from active duty on November 30, 2004.

2. On December 20, 2004, the AOJ received a VA Form 21-526, for claims of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disorder, a right knee disorder, a right shoulder disorder, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus.

3. In a February 28, 2023 rating decision, service connection was awarded for acromioclavicular degenerative arthritis of the right shoulder, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus, effective December 1, 2004.

4. In a March 30, 2023 rating decision, service connection was awarded for left knee degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, and right knee degenerative arthritis, effective December 1, 2004.

5. On April 14, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, requesting review of the disability evaluations assigned for his service-connected right and left knee disabilities.

6. In a January 11, 2024 rating decision, the AOJ awarded the Veteran an increased, 40 percent disability evaluation for his service-connected left knee degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, effective April 14, 2023.  The January 11, 2024 rating decision also awarded the Veteran service connection for left knee scar, left knee dislocated semilunar cartilage, left knee sprain with incomplete ligament tear, left knee condition, and left knee resurfacing; an effective date of April 14, 2023 was assigned for each award of service connection.

7. A June 12, 2024 rating decision changed the effective date for the award of service connection for left knee scar to September 22, 2023 and recharacterized the Veteran's left knee degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, as left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

8. A September 10, 2024 rating decision changed the effective date of the award of an increased, 40 percent disability evaluation for his service-connected left knee arthritis; the rating decision recharacterized the Veteran's left knee sprain with incomplete ligament tear as patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability, with a revised effective date for the award of service connection of September 22, 2023.

9. Service connection for left knee condition was severed effective September 22, 2023, in an unappealed January 2025 rating decision.

10. Service connection for left knee resurfacing was severed effective September 22, 2023, in an unappealed January 2025 rating decision.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1984 to November 2004.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  The rating decision in this case was issued after February 19, 2019; thus, the AMA framework applies.

In a February 28, 2023 rating decision, in pertinent part, the AOJ awarded the Veteran service connection for acromioclavicular joint arthritis of the right shoulder (rated as 20 percent disabling), bilateral hearing loss (rated as noncompensable), and tinnitus (rated as 10 percent disabling); an effective date of December 1, 2004 was assigned for each award of benefits.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on March 1, 2023.  

In a March 30, 2023 rating decision, the AOJ awarded the Veteran service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, and for right knee degenerative arthritis.  A 10 percent disability evaluation was assigned for each knee, effective December 1, 2004.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on March 31, 2023.

The Veteran, on April 14, 2023, filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, requesting review of the March 30, 2023 rating decision as to the disability evaluations assigned for each knee.  The Veteran requested a Higher-Level Review Informal Conference.

On July 22, 2023, the Veteran and his representative were provided with a Higher-Level Review Informal Conference with a Decision Review Officer at the AOJ.  On July 23, 2023, the AOJ found a duty to assist error with regard to the Veteran's service-connected left knee degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, and ordered additional development.

In a January 11, 2024 rating decision, the AOJ awarded the Veteran service connection for left knee dislocated semilunar cartilage, left knee sprain with incomplete ligament tear, left knee condition, and left knee resurfacing.  An effective date of April 14, 2023 was assigned for each award.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on January 12, 2024.  

The Veteran appealed the February 2023, March 2023, and January 2024 rating decisions to the Board by filing a February 5, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.  The Veteran requested Direct Review.  On February 13, 2024, the Board acknowledged receipt of the Veteran's Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182).  Under its review, the Board will now only consider all evidence of record at the time of the corresponding notices of the rating decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.     

Duties to Notify and Assist

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Earlier Effective Date

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increased, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran is the day following the date of discharge or release if the application therefor is received within one year from such date of discharge or release.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1).  

The Court has made it clear that the date of the filing of a claim is controlling in determinations as to effective dates.  A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The benefit sought must be identified, though it need not be specific.  See Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 199 (1992).  

Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by VA.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by VA, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim was defined as a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  Any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits administered by VA may be considered an informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).

After March 24, 2015, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by the Secretary.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).

In assigning effective dates for increases, except as provided in paragraph § 3.400(o)(2) and § 3.401(b), the effective date is date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  As an exception to this general rule, § 3.400(o)(2) provides that the effective date is the earliest date of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of claim.  

The Court has held that 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) are applicable only where an increase in disability precedes a claim for an increased disability rating.  See Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997).  Thus, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of the case: (1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose); (2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable); or (3) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim).  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see also Harper v. Brown, supra. 

Under the modernized, AMA, system of review, an effective date can be preserved if a claim is continuously pursued.  For a claim to be continuously pursued, a supplemental claim must be filed within one year after a final decision or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  For continuously pursued claims, except as otherwise provided by other provisions of this part, including 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision, provided that any appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims must be accepted as timely by that court.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  

Except as otherwise provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision or the Board issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

In a recent decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) invalidated the part of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 that excluded supplemental claims from the intent-to-file framework; thus, if a supplemental claim is received within one year of an intent to file, the date the intent to file was received is the date of claim for effective date purposes. Military-Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

A pending claim is an application, formal or informal, which has not been finally adjudicated. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(c).  The pending claims doctrine provides that a claim remains pending in the adjudication process if VA fails to act on it.  Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 422 (1999).  Raising a pending claim theory in connection with a challenge to the effective-date decision is procedurally proper.  Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 249, 255 (2007).

Regarding the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statue or regulation.  However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. This is determined on a "facts found" basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober; 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). It is important to note that an effective date generally can be no earlier than the facts found.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011). For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 1, 2004 for the award of service connection for left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 1, 2004 for the award of service connection for right knee degenerative arthritis. 

?

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 1, 2004 for the award of service connection for acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis, right shoulder.

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 1, 2004 for the award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

5. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 1, 2004 for the award of service connection for tinnitus.

In arguing for the assignment of earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection of left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, right knee degenerative arthritis, acromioclavicular joint arthritis of the right shoulder, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus, the Veteran argues that the effective dates should be retroactive; the Veteran did not specify a retroactive effective date to which he felt entitled, nor did he state his reasons for seeking earlier effective dates.  

As previously discussed, the assignment of an effective date turns on the date of claim and the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  

Here, the Veteran separated from service on November 30, 2004.  A review of the record reflects that VA received a VA Form 21-526 (Application for Disability Compensation and/or Pension) claiming entitlement to service connection for a left knee disorder, a right knee disorder, a right shoulder disorder, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus on December 20, 2004.  Thus, the earliest possible effective date for the awards of service connection for a left knee disorder, a right knee disorder, a right shoulder disorder, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus is December 1, 2004, the date after the Veteran's separation from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b).  This is the effective date currently assigned.

As for the date entitlement arose, to the extent that the Veteran argues that he should be entitled to earlier effective dates based on the date he was treated for complaints of or diagnosed with a left knee disorder, a right knee disorder, a right shoulder disorder, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus, the Board points out there is no provision for an award of service-connected disability compensation prior to discharge from active duty; the law clearly states that the date of the grant of service connection cannot be prior to the date entitlement arose, as the Veteran is not entitled to VA benefits while on active duty.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(d).  In this case, the Veteran's date of separation was November 30, 2004.  Thus, the earliest possible effective date for the awards of service connection for a left knee disorder, a right knee disorder, a right shoulder disorder, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus is December 1, 2004. 

Therefore, under the laws and regulations pertaining to effective dates, the claims of entitlement to an effective date prior to December 1, 2004, for the awards of service connection for acromioclavicular joint arthritis of the right shoulder, right knee degenerative arthritis, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus, as well as the claim of entitlement to an effective date prior to December 1, 2004 for the award of service connection for left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome, are denied.  

6. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 22, 2023 for the award of service connection for a left knee scar.

7. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 22, 2023 for the award of service connection for left knee patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability.

In arguing for the assignment of earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection of left knee scar and left knee patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (previously rated as left knee sprain incomplete ligament tear), the Veteran argues that the effective dates should be retroactive; the Veteran did not specify a retroactive effective date to which he felt entitled, nor did he state his reasons for seeking earlier effective dates.

In this case, no claims of entitlement to service connection for a left knee scar or left knee patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability were received by the AOJ.  The Veteran was granted service connection for left knee scar and left knee patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability during the course of the AOJ's adjudication of the Veteran's claim of entitlement to a higher initial disability evaluation for his left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome.  As previously discussed, on December 20, 2004, the AOJ received a VA Form 21-526, for wherein the Veteran requested service connection for a left knee disorder.  

Accordingly, the date of claim is December 20, 2004.  Thus, the earliest possible effective date for the awards of service connection for a left knee scar and left knee patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability is December 1, 2004, the date after the Veteran's separation from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b).  

As noted above, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  However, when applying the general rule, the assignment of an effective date based on date entitlement arose being later than the date of receipt of the claim is only appropriate when the evidence clearly establishes that the entitling criteria were not met as of the date of receipt of the claim.  Here, the Board finds that the entitling criteria, namely manifestations of a left knee scar and left knee instability were clearly met on the date of the Veteran's December 20, 2004 claim for benefits.  In this regard, the Board observes that service treatment records indicate that the Veteran underwent a left knee scope in March 1991 and a left knee arthroscopy with debridement of the medial meniscus in July 2000; one or both surgeries likely resulted in the Veteran's scar.  Likewise, the Veteran's service treatment records reflect intermittent complaints of left knee instability (see, i.e., February 1989 service treatment record).  Because the Veteran's left knee scar and left knee patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability had onset prior to separation from service, the Veteran can be said to have met the entitling criteria on the date of claim.  See Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377 (1999) ("[T]he effective date of an award of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA.").  

Therefore, under the laws and regulations pertaining to effective dates, entitlement to an effective date of December 1, 2004, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for left knee scar and for the grant of service connection for left knee patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability, is granted.  

8. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 22, 2023 for the award of an increased, 40 percent disability evaluation for left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

In arguing for the assignment of an earlier effective date for the award of an increased, 40 percent disability evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome, the Veteran argues that the effective date should be retroactive; the Veteran did not specify a retroactive effective date to which he felt entitled, nor did he state his reason for seeking an earlier effective date.

As noted above, essentially, the effective date for an increased disability rating is either the date entitlement arose or the date of receipt of claim, whichever is later, or, if entitlement arose within one year prior to the date of claim, then that date is the effective date.  

With regard to the date the claim was received, as previously stated, the VA first received a communication from the Veteran evincing intent to apply for benefits on December 20, 2004, when VA received a completed VA Form 21-526, wherein the Veteran claimed entitlement to service connection for a left knee disorder.

In a March 30, 2023 rating decision, the AOJ awarded service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, and assigned a 10 percent disability evaluation, effective December 1, 2004.  The Veteran was notified of this rating decision on March 31, 2023.  

On April 14, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, requesting review of the March 2023 rating decision as to the disability evaluation assigned for the Veteran's service-connected left knee degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear.  On July 22, 2023, the Veteran was afforded a Higher-Level Review Informal Conference.

In a July 23, 2023 rating decision, the AOJ indicated that a duty to assist error was identified during its higher-level review, namely that the AOJ failed to obtain a VA examination.  A VA knee examination was obtained on September 22, 2023.

In a January 11, 2024 rating decision, the AOJ awarded the Veteran an increased, 40 percent disability evaluation for his left knee degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, effective April 14, 2023.  The Veteran was notified of this rating decision on January 12, 2024.  As previously discussed, the Veteran filed his appeal to the Board via a VA Form 10182 on February 5, 2024.

The Board observes that, subsequent to the Veteran's appeal, in a June 12, 2024, the Veteran's left knee disorder was recharacterized as left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome.  A September 10, 2024 rating decision proposed revising the effective date of the award of an increased, 40 percent disability evaluation to September 22, 2023.  A January 24, 2025 rating decision implemented the change in effective date to September 22, 2023 for the award of an increased, 40 percent disability evaluation for the Veteran's left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

The effective date of an increased rating claim is the date of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  There is one exception in increased rating claims is that if entitlement arose within the one year prior to the date of claim, the effective date can be the date entitlement arose within that year prior to the date of claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

As previously discussed, the Veteran separated from service on November 30, 2004, the date of claim is December 20, 2004, and the earliest possible effective date is December 1, 2004.  

In this case, the Board observes that the Veteran's claim for an increased disability evaluation arose out of the Veteran's disagreement with the initial 10 percent disability evaluation assigned from the date of the award of service connection, December 1, 2004.  Because the Veteran timely filed a request for higher level review within one year of the March 30, 2023 rating decision awarding service connection, and filed his appeal to the Board within one year of the January 11, 2024 rating decision awarding the Veteran an increased, 40 percent disability evaluation for left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome, the Board finds that the Veteran's initial date of claim was preserved under the new AMA rules, and that the appeal period extends to December 1, 2004.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  As previously noted, supplemental claims are no longer excluded from the intent-to-file framework under the modernized review system.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. July 2021).  

Accordingly, the date of claim is December 20, 2004, and the earliest possible effective date for the award of an increased, 40 percent disability evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome is December 1, 2004, the date after the Veteran's separation from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b).  

For an increase in disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).  In order for entitlement to an increase in disability compensation to arise, the disability must have increased in severity to a degree warranting an increase in compensation.  See Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511, 519 (1992).  Thus, determining whether an effective date assigned for an increased rating is correct or proper under the law requires: (1) a determination of the date of the receipt of the claim and (2) a review of all the evidence of record to determine when an increase in disability was "ascertainable."  Hazan, 10 Vet. App. at 521.

Turning to the question of when entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for left knee strain arose, the Board notes that the Veteran is assigned a 40 percent disability rating pursuant to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003 - 5261.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20.  

The Board notes that the amended Diagnostic Code 5003, effective February 7, 2021, is substantively unchanged.  To this point, the Board notes that Diagnostic Code 5003 was revised to reflect that this Diagnostic Code only applies to degenerative arthritis. Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76460 (Nov. 30, 2020) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003).

Diagnostic Code 5003 provides that degenerative arthritis substantiated by x-ray findings is rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved.  When limitation of motion is noncompensable under the appropriate diagnostic codes, a rating of 10 percent is for application for each major joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion.  A 20 percent evaluation is warranted for x-ray evidence of involvement of 2 or more major or minor joints, with occasional incapacitating exacerbations.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003.  However, the Veteran's left knee constituted only one major joint, thus a higher rating is not warranted under this provision.

Under Diagnostic Code 5261, limitation of extension of the knee of 5 degrees warrants a noncompensable rating, 10 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating, 15 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating, 20 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating, 30 degrees warrants a 40 percent rating, and 45 degrees warrants a 50 percent rating. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's increase in symptomatology of his left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome was first demonstrated at his September 22, 2023 VA examination, which was obtained following his December 1, 2004 claim for service connection and his request for higher-level review.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was also provided a VA examination in January 2023, but notes that this examination was provided for the purpose of determining entitlement to service connection and was insufficient for rating purposes; as such, it is not for consideration here.  At the September 22, 2023 VA examination, the Veteran had extension to 30 degrees with pain on motion; range of motion upon repetitive use over time was estimated as extension to 35 degrees and range of motion during flare-ups was estimated as 40 degrees.  The Board finds that the severity of symptoms present at the September 2023 VA examination were likely present at the time of his claim for service connection on December 20, 2004.  In this regard, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran did not explicitly meet the diagnostic criteria for a 40 percent disability evaluation prior to the September 2023 VA examination, but points out that the AOJ failed to timely reschedule the Veteran for a VA examination after the Veteran was unable to report to the VA examination initially scheduled in January 2005, and thus no examination was provided for nearly 19 years following his service.  The Board also notes that the AOJ did not make any effort to determine whether the Veteran sought treatment from any private medical providers during that 19-year period.  As such, the available evidence does not provide enough information to evaluate the Veteran under the relevant diagnostic criteria for the entire rating period on appeal.  Thus, to say that the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for which he was not properly evaluated defies logic.  Furthermore, a finding that the Veteran's left knee strain worsened on the date of the September 2023 VA examination and not in the interim time period between the claim for service connection and the date of the September 2023 VA examination is also illogical record.  It is clear that the Veteran's left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome worsened at some, unknown point, prior to the September 22, 2023 VA examination.   Accordingly, the Board finds that December 1, 2004 is the date entitlement arose.

Accordingly, under the laws and regulations pertaining to effective dates, entitlement to an effective date of December 1, 2004, for the award of a 40 percent disability evaluation for left knee strain with degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension, and chondromalacia patella, status-post meniscal tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome, but no earlier, is granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

10. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 22, 2023 for the award of service connection for left knee resurfacing.

?

11. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 22, 2023 for the award of service connection for left knee dislocated semilunar cartilage.

As previously discussed, service connection for left knee condition, left knee dislocated semilunar cartilage, and left knee resurfacing was awarded in a January 11, 2024 rating decision; an effective date of April 14, 2023 was assigned for each award of service connection.

In pertinent part, in a January 31, 2024 rating decision, the AOJ stated that clear and unmistakable error was found in a prior rating decision and proposed a new effective date of September 22, 2023 for the awards of service connection for left knee dislocated semilunar cartilage, left knee resurfacing, and left knee condition.  In a June 12, 2024 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the change in the effective date.  

In a September 10, 2024 rating decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, proposed to discontinue service connection for left knee condition, left knee dislocated semilunar cartilage, and left knee resurfacing, effective September 22, 2023; the AOJ found clear and unmistakable error in the prior, January 11, 2024 rating decision, wherein service connection was awarded.

In a January 24, 2025 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the proposed severance of service connection for left knee condition, left knee dislocated semilunar cartilage, and left knee resurfacing, effective September 22, 2023.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on January 27, 2025.  The Veteran has not appealed the severance of service connection for his left knee condition, left knee dislocated semilunar cartilage, and left knee resurfacing.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's appeals of the claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the grants of service connection for left knee condition, left knee dislocated semilunar cartilage, and left knee resurfacing were pending at the time of severance of service connection.  VA regulation, however, provides that a retroactive increase or additional benefit will not be awarded after basic entitlement has been terminated, such as by severance of service connection.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  As the Veteran has not appealed the severance determination, the regulatory bar on retroactive increase or additional benefit in § 3.400(o)(1) applies.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(d).  

The Court has held that in cases such as this, where the law is dispositive, the claim should be denied because of the absence of legal merit.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).  As the awards of service connection for the Veteran's left knee condition, left knee dislocated semilunar cartilage, and left knee resurfacing were in error, the appeals of his claims for earlier effective dates must be denied.
