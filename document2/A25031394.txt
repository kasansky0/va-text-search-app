DOCKET NO. 210303-207868
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) dental services provided by Breathe Easy Dental from October 15, 2019, to November 5, 2019, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran received care through the Veterans Community Care Program by an authorized in-network provider from October 15, 2019, to November 5, 2019; the billing process and payment is governed by statutory and contractual authority that does not allow for review by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board). 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to payment for dental care provided by Breathe Easy Dental from October 15, 2019, to November 5, 2019, has been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1703D, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4030, 17.4035.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant, Breathe Easy Dental, is a non-VA healthcare provider who rendered services to the Veteran from October 15, 2019, to November 5, 2019, as an in-network provider of the Veterans Community Care Program.  See generally 38 U.S.C. § 1703(c), (h).

This matter comes before the Board on appeals from determinations made by the VA Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the March 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Wounded Warrior Project was contacted as early as November 2024, as well as January 2025, to afford an opportunity to provide an Informal Hearing Presentation (IHP).  To date, an IHP has not been provided.  The Board notes that the Veteran is represented by the Wounded Warrior Project as to unrelated service connection claims.  See January 2024 Rating Decision Narrative.  As the Veteran is not the appellant in this case, and the representative has been afforded opportunity to provide an IHP, if warranted, the Board may proceed to the review the claim.

1. Payment of care provided from October 5, 2019, to November 5, 2019.  

The appellant, Breathe Easy Dental, contends that the care provided to the Veteran from October 5, 2019, to November 5, 2019, was authorized by the Veterans Community Care Program, and should be paid.  See March 2021 VA Form 10182.  

At the outset, the record reflects that the appellant is a provider within the Veterans Community Care Program network of non-VA healthcare providers and the Veteran was authorized to receive certain medical services by the appellant.

VA was directed to enter contracts to establish this network of non-VA healthcare providers to provide sufficient access to medical services.  38 U.S.C. § 1703(h). This included contracting with a Third-Party Administrator (TPA) to process claims for compensation for the medical services provided by the in-network non-VA healthcare providers.  38?U.S.C. §?1703D(g)(1).  The process for billing for the medical or dental services, including correction of those claims and the payment by VA for such services, are governed by the contractual agreements which this appellant entered to become a Community Care Network provider.  38?U.S.C. §?1703D(a)-(g), (i); 38?C.F.R. §§ 17.4030, 17.4035.  Therefore, the governing statute and implementing regulations have established a process for billing medical services furnished through the Veterans Community Care Program which does not contemplate Board review.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1703(h), 1703D; 38 C.F.R. § 17.4030.

VHA instructed the provider to resubmit the claim with the authorization number, if approved, to the TPA for adjudication and payment.  See VHA File, pg. 7. 

In sum, the applicable statutes and regulations governing the Veterans Community Care Program do not contemplate Board review of a question on whether payment is warranted for in-network dental services provided by the appellant.  Therefore, the instant appeal by Breathe Easy Dental seeking payment must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1703(h), 1703D; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4030, 17.4035.
