REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1988 to June 1992, including service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf Era.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  As the Veteran is withdrawing his appeal, his hearing request is likewise withdrawn.

The Board notes that while the June 2024 VA Form 10182 at issue included service connection for erectile dysfunction and lumbar spine condition.  The June 10, 2024, rating decision, however, deferred both of these issues.  A deferred adjudication of a claim is not a decision, and it is therefore not appealable.  Therefore, the listing of these deferred issues on the June 2024 VA Form 10182 does not constitute a valid appeal of those claims and they are not before the Board at this time.  The Board notes that they were decided later that month and were appealed under a separate appeal stream.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative.  Id.  In the present case, the appellant has withdrawn this appeal in a July 2024 written communication and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration with regard to these issues.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal of these issues and they are dismissed.
