ORDER

A rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

The appeal of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED) is dismissed.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for Meniere's syndrome, to include as secondary to service-connected tinnitus, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus is rated as 10 percent disabling, which is the maximum schedular rating authorized under Diagnostic Code (DC) 6260; the Veteran does not contend nor does the record raise entitlement to an extraschedular rating.

2. There is no Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for ED within one year of receipt of the October 2023 notice of disagreement (NOD); or a requestion for an extension of time to file an NOD as a prior adverse determination with good cause.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(b), 4.1, 4.87, DC 6260.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of entitlement to service connection for ED have been met. . 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.202, 20.301.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2013 to April 2015. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued on September 29, 2023, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the AMA, applies.

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 29, 2023, rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for plantar fasciitis and Meniere's syndrome, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The record shows that the Veteran obtained representation in January 2025 and, thereafter, a Board letter notified the representative that the Veteran had an appeal at the Board.

Evaluations

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected tinnitus.

A November 2019 rating decision granted service connection for tinnitus, and assigned a 10 percent rating, effective July 23, 2019. See Rating Decision (November 2019). A July 2023 rating decision continued the rating. 

In August 2023, VA received the Veteran's claim for increased See VA Form 21-526EZ (August 2023). A September 29, 2023, rating decision, denied the claim. See Rating Decision (September 2023). This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with that decision. See VA 10182 (October 2023).

The Board concludes that here is no basis for a schedular rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(b), 4.1, 4.87, DC 6260.

Recurrent tinnitus is evaluated under DC 6260, which provides that only a single 10 percent evaluation is assigned for tinnitus, whether the sound is perceived as being in one ear, in both ears, or in the head. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6260, Note 2. The maximum schedular rating available for tinnitus is 10 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6260; Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Here, the Veteran has been assigned the maximum schedular rating available for tinnitus, which is assigned regardless of the extent of the tinnitus and whether the ringing is one or both ears. Moreover, the Veteran has not identified any symptoms of his tinnitus that are not contemplated by the rating schedule, so extraschedular consideration has not been raised. As the maximum schedular rating for tinnitus under DC 6260 has already been assigned, a higher schedular rating or separate 10 percent disability rating for tinnitus of each ear are not warranted.

Accordingly, the claim is denied as there is no legal basis upon which to award an evaluation in excess of 10 percent or separate schedular evaluation for tinnitus in each ear. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

Lastly, the Board finds that, as the Veteran's tinnitus is rated at the maximum schedular level, and an extraschedular rating is not raised by the Veteran, the representative, or the record, the AOJ had no duty to obtain an examination for his tinnitus. Therefore, remand is not required. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

2. Entitlement to service connection for ED.

The Veteran seeks service connection for ED although the claim had not been addressed in any prior VA decision. See VA Form 10182 (October 2023). 

The Board concludes that due to a claims processing rules defect, the issue of entitlement to service connection for ED is dismissed. Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). VA regulations under the AMA require that a completed VA Form 10182 be received within one year from the date that the AOJ mailed the notice of the decision being appealed. The date of the mailing of the letter of notification of the decision is to be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).

Here, the October 2023 VA Form 10182 identified a September 2023 rating decision; however, the issue of entitlement to service connection for ED was not adjudicated by the AOJ in a September 2023 rating decision, or in any rating decision prior to the filing of the October 2023 VA Form 10182 (NOD). In other words, because there has been no prior decision on this issue, it is not eligible for review in the modernized system. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b). Also, it is not eligible for review in the earlier legacy review system because VA has never issued a decision in the matter of service connection for ED.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for a claims processing defect. 

Addtionally, the Board finds that the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c) are not applicable. The regulation provides that notice and the opportunity to present evidence and argument, including the opportunity for a hearing, must be provided to all parties when the Board raises a question as to a "potential" jurisdictional defect. However, § 20.104(c) pertains to "jurisdictional authority" and not to "claims processing rules" defects. Nevertheless, even if § 20.104(c) was to apply, there is no question as to a "potential" jurisdictional defect, rather an actual and evident defect on the face of the record. See Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) (strict adherence to requirements of law is not warranted when adherence would result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the veteran).

Lastly, the Board is conscious that recent caselaw has drawn a distinction between jurisdiction and the legal and regulatory requirements necessary to begin an appeal and receive appellate review ("claims processing rules"). See, e.g., Hall, 34 Vet. App. 329. To the extent that this recent caselaw calls into question whether this matter is properly dismissed, the Board finds that VA regulations and the laws from which they are derived clearly state that the Board may not review applications for appeal unless they meet the legal criteria. 38 U.S.C. § 7108 (An application for review on appeal shall not be entertained unless it is in conformity with this chapter). See also, 38 U.S.C. 7105(a)-(b) (Appellate review shall be initiated by the filing of a notice of disagreement in the form prescribed by the Secretary. A notice of disagreement shall be filed within one year from the date of the mailing of the notice of the decision). Those criteria require that a NOD identify the decision with which the claimant disagrees and be submitted within one year from the date of mailing. Here, because the Veteran's October 2023 NOD identifies a decision that does not exist and the record shows that VA has never issued a decision on this matter, this NOD cannot, as a matter of law, meet the legal and regulatory criteria for review of this claim by the Board.

REASONS FOR REMAND

In remanding these matters, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions. Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.

1. Entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for Meniere's syndrome, to include as secondary to service-connected tinnitus, is remanded.

Favorable findings from the September 2023 rating decision on appeal include that the Veteran participated in toxic risk exposure activity (TERA) is conceded, based on exposure to fuels, such as diesel and JP-8, based on his Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) of Petroleum Supply Specialist. The rating decision also made the favorable finding that the Veteran's service separation examination reflects reported foot trouble. See Rating Decision (September 2023).

These issues are remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the September 2023 rating decision on appeal. The Veteran was not notified at his last known and regular used mailing address of his scheduled VA examinations in these matters.

Generally, VA has a duty to make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claimant's claim for a VA benefit. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(a). Further, this duty includes obtaining an examination and/or opinion when necessary to decide the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). When an examination is found to be necessary to decide a claim, there is a duty to notify a veteran of the time, place, and location of a scheduled examination. 

The Board finds that the AOJ did not fulfill its duty to notify the Veteran of his scheduled examinations at his last known address of record in Biloxi, Mississippi (MS), and, therefore, the AOJ did not fulfil its duty to obtain examinations in these matters. 

Here, the Veteran has not reported that he did not receive notice of the September 2023 scheduled examinations, to include after receiving notice that his claims were denied for failure to report for the scheduled examinations. However, the Board takes notice of the fact that the Veteran was unrepresented at the time of the September 2023 rating decision, and that the examination notice was mailed to the wrong address, an address in Gulfport, MS, rather than his regular and last known mailing address in Biloxi, MS. 

Although the record includes a Veteran Contact History showing that VA was working with the Veteran to schedule his examinations in these matters, the record of contact does not explicitly indicate that he was notified of the place of the examinations. See C&P Exam (September 2023) (reflects date and time of scheduled examinations). The Biloxi, MS, address was the correct address of record at the time of the examination scheduling. Indeed, the VA letter notifying the Veteran of the decision on appeal was sent to the Veteran's mailing address in Biloxi, MS, and his appeal to the Board on VA Form 10182 included the Biloxi, MS, mailing address. 

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The Veteran is reminded that VA's duty to assist is a two-way street.  If the Veteran wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where his cooperation is essential to establishing his claim.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Reschedule the Veteran for the missed examinations for plantar fasciitis and Meniere's syndrome, ensuring that mailed notice of the time, place, and location of the scheduled examinations is sent to the last known address of record. Note that his last known address of record may be different from that at the time when these examinations were originally scheduled-the AOJ should verify his address before scheduling the examinations.
