ORDER

Entitlement to a 100 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss from February 3, 2021 to April 27, 2022, is granted.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for bilateral hearing loss beginning April 27, 2022 is denied. 

Entitlement to a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted from July 1, 2020.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for aid and attendance of another person is granted from July 1, 2020.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. From February 3, 2021 to April 27, 2022, the competent evidence demonstrated that the Veteran's hearing loss was manifested by a Level XI in both ears, rendering it so severe as to warrant a 100 percent rating. 

2. From April 27, 2022 the competent evidence demonstrated that the Veteran's hearing loss was manifested by a Level VII in the right ear and a Level IX in the left ear, consistent with a 50 percent rating.

3. From July 1, 2020 to February 3, 2021 the Veteran's service-connected disabilities preclude substantially gainful employment consistent with his educational background and occupational experience.

4. From July 1, 2020 the Veteran's service-connected hearing loss renders him so helpless as to require the need for aid and attendance of another person.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from May 1964 to May 1968.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decisions issued in July 2022 and November 2023 (higher-level review) by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

Generally, the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an AMA docket switch has elapsed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows appellants to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days from when the Board receives the original Form 10182, or one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, whichever is later, unless (1) an appellant has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302 and 20.303, or (2) the appellant or representative has requested a waiver of the ability to request to switch dockets during this timeframe. See, Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). In this case, however, the case has been advanced on the docket at the request of the Veteran pursuant to a motion filed by the Veteran alongside his November 2024 Form 10182, and the Board views this motion and its submission alongside the Form 10182 as tantamount to a waiver of the 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) right to switch dockets.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for bilateral hearing loss from February 3, 2021 to April 27, 2022, but not after.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. See, 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where entitlement to compensation has already been established, and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Although a rating specialist is directed to review the recorded history of a disability in order to make a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994); 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. Staged ratings are, however, appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. The relevant focus for adjudicating an increased rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim. See generally Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See, 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Additionally, if a claimant submits an intent to file application and the formal application is received within one year of submitting the Intent to File a Claim, the effective date for compensation will be the day VA received the Intent To File A Claim application. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), the effective date of an award of increased disability compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the application is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Id.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b)(2).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) are applicable only where an increase in disability precedes a claim for an increased disability rating; otherwise, the general rule of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1) applies. See, Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997). 

The period on appeal begins December 9, 2021, the date the Veteran filed his claim for an increased rating and includes the one-year "look back" period. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is rated as 50 percent disabling for the period beginning December 9, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6100.

Hearing loss is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, DC 6100, which provides that numeric designations are assigned based upon a mechanical use of tables found in 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, based on pure tone thresholds and speech discrimination; there is no room for subjective interpretation. Under Table VI, a Roman numeral designation (I through XI) for hearing impairment is found based on a combination of the percent of speech discrimination scores and the pure tone threshold average. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(b). Table VIA will be used, which assigns a Roman numeral designation solely on the pure tone threshold average, when the examiner certifies that use of the speech discrimination test is not appropriate because of language difficulties, inconsistent speech discrimination scores, etc. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(c). Table VIA may also be used when there is an exceptional pattern of hearing impairment. Such a pattern occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more, or when the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86. The Table which yields the better result for the Veteran is to be selected. The pure tone threshold average is the sum of the pure tone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz, divided by four. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(d). The Roman numeral designations determined using Table VI or Table VIA are combined using Table VII to find the percentage evaluation to be assigned for the hearing impairment.

Pursuant to the Veteran's private audiological examination on February 3, 2021, pure tone testing in the Veteran's right ear showed: 60 decibels at 1000 hertz, 80 decibels at 2000 hertz, 95 decibels at 3000 hertz, and 100 decibels at 4000 hertz. Pure tone testing in the Veteran's left ear showed: 60 decibels at 1000 hertz, 95 decibels at 2000 hertz, 90 decibels at 3000 hertz, and 100 decibels at 4000 hertz. The average of the Veteran's pure tone threshold in his right ear is 83.75 and 86.25 in the left. Speech discrimination in the Veteran's right ear right ear was 8 percent and, in the left ear, 20 percent. Using Table VI, both ears are classified as XI, showing maximum severity. Accordingly, the rating that corresponds with the classification using Table VII is the maximum, a 100 percent rating.

However, pursuant to the Veteran's VA audiological examination on April 27, 2022, pure tone testing in the Veteran's right ear showed: 55 decibels at 1000 hertz, 65 decibels at 2000 hertz, 95 decibels at 3000 hertz, and 100 decibels at 4000 hertz. Pure tone testing in the Veteran's left ear showed: 45 decibels at 1000 hertz, 65 decibels at 2000 hertz, 90 decibels at 3000 hertz, and 105+ decibels at 4000 hertz. The average of the Veteran's pure tone threshold in his right ear is 78.75 and 76.25 in the left. Speech discrimination in the Veteran's right ear right ear was 62 percent and, in the left ear, 40 percent. Using Table VI, the right ear is classified as VII and the left ear as IX. Accordingly, the rating that corresponds with the classification using Table VII is a 50 percent rating.

Consequently, given the medical evidence of record, a staged rating is appropriate. The Board finds a disability rating of 100 percent for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss is warranted from February 3, 2021 to April 27, 2022, the earliest date and final date, respectively, as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, and the Veteran's claim was received within one year from the February 3, 2021, but is not warranted from April 27, 2022. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2),

Entitlement to TDIU from July 1, 2020.

TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. 

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see, Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018) (combining disabilities as "one disability" to meet the rating threshold of § 4.16(a) requires the use of the combined rating table).

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components. See, Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. Id. Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Id. 

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training. See, Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The ultimate question is whether they are capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The appeal period for this claim begins on July 1, 2020, the date the Veteran filed his claim for TDIU. From July 1, 2020, the Veteran has the following disabilities that are service connected: bilateral hearing loss, rated at 100 percent from February 3, 2021 to April 27, 2022 and as 50 percent disabling afterwards; and anxiety disorder, associated with bilateral hearing loss, rated at 70 percent from July 1, 2020.  Accordingly, the Board may consider the claim for TDIU on a schedular basis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that TDIU is warranted.

The Veteran last worked in 2003 as a custodian for a school district, a job at which he worked for 12 years. Previously, he worked as an accountant from 1968 to 1988 with additional work as a property manager from an unspecified amount of time before he became a custodian. He completed four years of college. See July 2020 VA Form 21-8940; April 2021 Vocational Assessment.

The Veteran's ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation is primarily impacted by his hearing loss. The Veteran underwent a private vocational assessment in April 2021, in which the examiner concluded there is no way, despite the Veteran having a stellar work history and continuing treatment, that he would be able to secure or follow any type of competitive substantially gainful occupation even at the sedentary unskilled level of work in the national economy since at least 2018, when his physicians documented a significant worsening of his bilateral hearing loss. As rationale, in pertinent part, the examiner noted that, although the Veteran has been suffering from significant bilateral hearing loss since the mid 1970's and began wearing hearing aids years later, it has progressed to such a level that as of 2020, he cannot hear at all if he removes his hearing aids. His current level of impairment has likely been present since 2018 given the audiology note that indicated significant worsening and follow-up in 2019 which reported the same hearing loss since his 2018 evaluation. Even with his hearing aids in, The Veteran has a very difficult time effectively hearing which affects his everyday life. He can hear voices but finds it difficult to determine the actual words being spoken. He misses a good portion of what is being said and must ask for the information to be repeated. He is embarrassed and it is exhausting, and he will not continue to ask for information to be repeated and then he misses most of what is being said. Even with his hearing aids, background noise is amplified and usually drowns out the voices of those speaking directly to him. The ringing and buzzing in his ears make it even more difficult for him to hear at all. The Veteran must rely on his wife to relay information back to him often due to his hearing loss which adds to his overall frustration.

Given the forgoing, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, particularly his bilateral hearing loss, preclude him from the ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his education, skills, training, and work history. Accordingly, TDIU from August 1, 2020, the date of the Veteran's claim for such, is warranted.

Entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance of another person from July 1, 2020.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to SMC benefits based on the need for regular aid and attendance of another.

SMC is payable at a specified rate if the Veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, needs regular aid and attendance. The Veteran's current service-connected disabilities are bilateral hearing loss, rated at 100 percent from February 3, 2021, and anxiety disorder, associated with bilateral hearing loss, rated at 70 percent from July 1, 2020.

A need for aid and attendance means helplessness or is so nearly helpless as to require the regular aid and attendance of another person. A Veteran will be considered to be in need of regular aid and attendance if he or she is blind or is so nearly blind as to have corrected visual acuity of 5/200 or less, in both eyes, or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less; if the Veteran is a patient in a nursing home because of mental or physical incapacity; or if the evidence establishes a factual need for aid and attendance or "permanently bedridden" status under the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a). 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b).

The following factors will be accorded consideration in determining the need for regular aid and attendance: inability of a claimant to dress or undress himself, or to keep himself ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without aid (this will not include the adjustments of appliances which normal persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.); inability of a claimant to feed himself through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; inability to attend to the wants of nature; or incapacity, either physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from hazards or dangers incident to his daily environment. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).

A finding that the Veteran is "bedridden" will provide a proper basis for the determination. Bedridden will be that condition which, through its essential character, actually requires that the Veteran remain in bed. The fact that a veteran has voluntarily taken to bed or that a physician has prescribed rest in bed for the greater or lesser part of the day to promote convalescence or cure will not suffice. It is not required that all of the disabling conditions enumerated in this paragraph be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. Id. 

The particular personal functions that the Veteran is unable to perform are considered in connection with the individual's condition as a whole. It is only necessary that the evidence establish that the Veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there be a constant need. Determinations that a Veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance will not be based solely upon an opinion that the claimant's condition is such as would require him to be in bed. They must be based on the actual requirement of personal assistance from others. Id. 

Although a Veteran need not show all of the disabling conditions identified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a) to establish entitlement to aid and attendance, the Court has held that it is logical to infer there is a threshold requirement that "at least one of the enumerated factors be present." Turco v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 222, 224 (1996). The critical question to be determined in this case is whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have resulted in the need for regular aid and attendance of another person because of resultant helplessness due to mental and/or physical impairment.

In summation, the competent evidence reflects that, as a result of his service-connected disabilities, the Veteran is rendered so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance. The Veteran underwent a private assessment regarding his claims that he is need of regular aid and assistance in April 2021 where the examiner concluded he not safe to ambulate independently as a result of loss of balance due to his hearing loss and the Veteran's hearing loss could cause danger to himself or others if not for his wife's assistance. As rationale, the examiner noted due to his impaired balance he is a fall risk. Hearing loss can lead to impaired postural balance. In fact, the Veteran has experienced and continues to experience balance impairments. Every morning upon awakening, he must sit at bedside to stabilize prior to arising. His spouse remains at his side until his body can stabilize. Without performing same, he is unable to safely ambulate. The Veteran's spouse must assist with his transfer to the shower with what is known as standby assistance. Standby assistance is that which is defined as supervision to ensure one's safety nearby so that in the event of a downward displacement immediate intervention can ensue. The same dynamic is true for dressing this gentleman, i.e., he is unable to pull his pants up while bracing himself on a surface to balance himself. Given his instability, he is provided with standby assistance for each activity of daily living that requires him to stand up, ambulate, or transfer. 

Regarding the Veteran's hearing loss on the impact of his daily activities, the Veteran's hearing loss causes impairments that can cause danger to himself or to others. The Veteran is unable to hear smoke detectors or fire alarms. He is also unable to hear the microwave, kitchen timer, or oven. This could lead to trouble should there be an emergency when the Veteran's wife was not home. The Veteran is unable to hear sirens or car horns when in the car. For this reason, the Veteran's wife must drive. If the Veteran were required to drive, he would be placing himself and others in danger. The Veteran is unable to communicate effectively with his doctors. This leads me to believe his hearing loss would affect his ability to manage his medical conditions effectively and safely if it were not for his wife communicating for the veteran. If it were not for his wife, the Veteran would be unable to communicate with others outside of the home should an emergency arise when the Veteran's wife is out of the house. Overall, the Veteran requires the regular aid and attendance of another person in order to protect himself from hazards or dangers incident to daily life due to his hearing impairment since at least 2018 when his word discrimination had significantly worsened, and he had to obtain new amplification.

Thus, the record clearly establishes that the Veteran's service-connected hearing loss renders him so helpless as to require the need for aid and attendance of another person. As such, payment of special monthly compensation at the aid and attendance rate is warranted from July 1, 2020. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).

As a final matter, a Veteran may receive SMC either by reason of being housebound or based on the need for regular aid and attendance, but in most cases may not receive both simultaneously. Regular aid and attendance set forth under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l) is the greater monetary award. Thus, SMC at the housebound rate is a lesser benefit than SMC at the aid and attendance rate. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). Accordingly, as the Veteran has been granted SMC based on aid and attendance, SMC at the housebound rate is moot, because SMC based on aid and attendance is the greater benefit. Therefore, the issue of SMC at the housebound rate will not be further considered. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(l), (s).
