ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left knee osteoarthritis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's symptoms left knee osteoarthritis has been adequately related to injury during active duty for training.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for left knee osteoarthritis have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1984 to February 1985.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2024, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Direct review is the appeal option to the Board in which a Board decision is issued based on evidence of record at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a Board hearing or accept into the record additional evidence in its direct review. 

The Board has expanded the Veteran's claim for service connection for a left leg disorder to include osteoarthritis of the left knee.

Service Connection Laws and Regulations 

The Veteran contends that his current osteoarthritis disability, manifested by left leg pain is due to his active-duty service.

In order to establish service connection for the claimed disability, there must be (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).

The requirement of a current disability is "satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim."  See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  If a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, then generally a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required for service connection if the disability is one that is listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may also be granted on the basis of a post-service initial diagnosis of a disease, where the physician relates the current condition to the period of service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).  Other specifically enumerated disorders will be presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within the first year following separation from active duty.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.309.

Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1153 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, some medical issues fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).

Generally, the degree of probative value which may be attributed to a medical opinion issued by a VA or private treatment provider takes into account such factors as its thoroughness and degree of detail, and whether there was review of the claims file.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000).  Also significant is whether the examining medical provider had a sufficiently clear and well-reasoned rationale and a basis in objective supporting clinical data.  See Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999); Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998); see also Claiborne v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 181, 186 (2005) (rejecting medical opinions that did not indicate whether the physicians actually examined the Veteran, did not provide the extent of any examination, and did not provide any supporting clinical data).

In evaluating the evidence in any given appeal, it is the responsibility of the Board to weigh the evidence and decide where to give credit and where to withhold the same and, in so doing, accept certain medical opinions over others.  Schoolman v. West, 12 Vet. App. 307, 310-11 (1999).  In this regard, the Board has been charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F. 3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau, supra.  Indeed, the Court has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to do so. Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 488-89 (2000).  In doing so, the Board is free to favor one medical opinion over another, provided it offers an adequate basis for doing so.  Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 (1998).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under the laws administered by VA.  VA shall consider all information and medical and lay evidence of record.  Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  Lastly, in order to deny a claim on its merits, the most persuasive and probative evidence must be against the claim.  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996).

Entitlement to service connection for left knee osteoarthritis is granted

The Veteran has been diagnosed with a left knee joint osteoarthritis disability.  See June 2024 VA examination.  There is no other diagnosed left leg disability.

As to the in-service incurrence, the Veteran presented to sick call with edema and left knee pain.  See September 1987 service treatment records (STR).  The Board finds sufficient evidence that the injury occurred during active duty for training 

As to the Veteran's lay statements, the Board notes that in a June 2024 VA examination, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran stated that the onset of his left leg pain, related to his osteoarthritis, occurred during his time in service.  The Veteran further discussed that it started twenty years ago.  He reported straining his left knee after performing a jump.  The Veteran stated that he currently experiences left knee pain with stiffness, and limited ROM/limited mobility.

Turning to the medical evidence, in a June 2024 VA examination the examiner diagnosed the Veteran's disability as left knee joint osteoarthritis.  The examiner noted that the Veteran reported that his injury occurred twenty years prior during a jump and that he currently experiences left knee pain with stiffness, and limited ROM/limited mobility.  The examiner further noted that the Veteran's STRs notate that the Veteran "returned from Jump School.  Since his return on PT sessions, he complains of swelling in his left knee.  No pain when at rest.  Only when attempting PT."  The examiner then opined that claimed condition was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner based the opinion on the premise that are no in-service treatment records found in the Veteran's medical records to support his claim condition.  The Board finds that in the face of the treatment records that do exist, the only conclusion that the Board can reach is that this examiner erroneously believed that only an in-service diagnosis of left knee osteoarthritis would have permitted the examiner to opine that his current condition was related to service.  

The Board notes that the VA opinion is inadequate as it is based, in part, on a lack the lack of medical evidence.  Lack of evidence cannot be treated as substantive negative evidence. In other words, reliance on the lack of medical evidence, especially without consideration of lay statements, is an inadequate rationale.  The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (the Court) has held that the mere absence of evidence does not equate to unfavorable evidence.  See Forshey v. Principi, 284 F.3d 1335, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (en banc) (cautioning that negative evidence, meaning actual evidence weighing against a party, must not be equated with the absence of substantive evidence); see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39-40 (2007) (holding that an examination must consider lay evidence of in-service incurrence or continuity of symptomatology since service).  

In addition, as alluded to previously, the Board believes that the examiner was under a misunderstanding of the applicable law, and had the examiner understood that it was not necessary to find evidence of a specific diagnosis of arthritis in service in order to opine that his current left knee problems were related to service, the examiner would have linked the Veteran's current left knee disorder to his injury during active duty for training.

With respect to a nexus, the Board notes that the Veteran's treatment records note an injury, complaints, and treatment for left knee issues.  A review of the Veteran's treatment records shows how his left knee issues began during service and have continued to the present date.  There is no reason for the Board to question the veracity of the lay statements submitted in support of this claim.  Additionally, the Board finds that a reasonable interpretation of the VA opinion in this matter is that it actually supports a relationship between the Veteran left knee osteoarthritis.  However, to the extent that the grant of service connection is based primarily on lay evidence, "nothing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] require both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself."  Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1335.

In sum, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the competent, credible, and probative medical and lay evidence demonstrates that the left knee pain was noted in service with continuity of symptomatology since service and that service connection for his left knee osteoarthritis is therefore warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, supra.
