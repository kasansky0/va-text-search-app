ORDER

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 70 percent for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety, and depressed mood, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence persuasively favors a finding that the Veteran's service-connected acquired psychiatric disorders do not result in total occupational and social impairment.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

For the entire period on appeal, the criteria for a rating in excess of 70 percent for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety, and depressed mood, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.400, 4.1-4.7, 4.10, 4.21, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1971 to February 1992. 

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a February 2022 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran filed his timely VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and chose direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). 

Accordingly, the Board will consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

By way of history, the Veteran was granted service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability in a March 2018 Board decision and was implemented in a March 2018 rating decision. The Veteran was assigned a 30 percent rating effective February 17, 2004. The Veteran was then sent a statement of the case (SOC) on January 15, 2019. The Veteran did not submit a VA form 9 within 60 days. Thus, the January 2019 SOC is final.

The Veteran then filed a supplemental claim in November 2021. The February 2022 rating decision granted a 70 percent rating for his acquired psychiatric disability with an effective date of November 24, 2021, the date the Veteran filed his supplemental claim. The Veteran then filed a VA form 10182 decision review request. The Veteran argued that his rating should go back to February 2004, the date he was granted service connection for his acquired psychiatric disability. 

AMA claims are adjudicated separately from claims under the legacy system, and the Board cannot merge AMA claims with legacy claims. Here, the prior final denial via the January 2019 SOC is final. The Board notes that the Veteran is free to file a claim alleging clear and unmistakable error (CUE) with regard to the effective date assigned by the AOJ in the previous rating decision. However, the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date of February 17, 2004 as it relates to his legacy claim is not on appeal here.  

In addition, 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(c) only allows for an appellant to elect AMA review of a legacy claim by opting-in under the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP), or by electing to proceed under the AMA after the issuance of a statement of the case or supplemental statement of the case. See id. There is no record of the Veteran opting his legacy claim into AMA. 

Increased ratings

Disability ratings are determined by application of the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating. Otherwise, the lower rating applies. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995). Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges that a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence as to any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA will resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Effective dates

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), the effective date of an award of increased disability compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Id.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b)(3).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) are applicable only where an increase in disability precedes a claim for an increased disability rating; otherwise, the general rule of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1) applies. See Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997). Thus, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of the case:

(1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1));

(2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2));

(3) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)).

Harper, 10 Vet. App at 126. Thus, determining an appropriate effective date for an increased rating under the effective date regulations involves an analysis of the evidence to determine (1) when a claim for an increased rating was received and, if possible, (2) when the increase in disability actually occurred. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400(o)(2).Section 5110(a), title 38, United States Code, provides that "[u]nless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter, the effective date of an award based on an original claim of compensation shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor." The implementing regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, similarly states that the effective date of service connection "will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later."

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 70 percent for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety, and depressed mood

On the Veteran's November 2022 VA Form 10182, his only contention was that his 70 percent rating should have an effective date in February 2004. However, the Board will evaluate the claim as an increased rating claim. 

The criteria for evaluating an acquired psychiatric disability are found in the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. Under this rating criteria, a 70 percent rating is warranted where there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id. 

A 100 percent rating requires total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Id.

The symptoms listed above serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating, and are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list. See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442-44 (2002). According to the applicable rating criteria, when evaluating a mental disorder, the frequency, severity, duration of psychiatric symptoms, length of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission must be considered. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(a).

VA medical records from December 2020 reveal the Veteran answered "no" when asked if over the past month, whether he wished he were dead or if he had thought of suicide. VA medical records from June 2021 show the Veteran was found to be well-groomed with appropriate affect. VA records from November 2021 show the Veteran answered "not at all" when asked if he had thoughts that he would be better off dead or of hurting himself in some way. In a different VA encounter in November 2021, the Veteran's appearance was noted as well-groomed and he denied suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, or psychosis. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA mental disorder examination in December 2021. The examiner indicated the Veteran's psychiatric disability manifested with occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation. The Veteran's symptoms were listed as: depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks more than once a week, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting, and neglect of personal appearance and hygiene. The examiner indicated the Veteran was not at  an elevated acute risk of suicide. The Veteran reported that he has been married four times and that he currently lives with his fourth wife of 12 years. The Veteran reported good relations with his six grown children.

On the same day as the VA examination on December 30, 2021, the Veteran was self-admitted to a VA inpatient psychiatric unit due to suicidal ideation. The Veteran was discharged in January 2022. The Veteran was discharged with no acute concerns. A January 2022 VA telehealth note reveals while the Veteran was in inpatient care, prazosin was resumed and titrated. Sertraline was increased to 100mg daily. The Veteran denied suicidal ideation.

The Board does not find that the Veteran meets the criteria for a 100 percent rating at any time during the appeal period. While the evidence does show that the Veteran has an instance of suicidal ideation, he did not exhibit grossly inappropriate behavior or persistent danger of hurting self or others, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, disorientation to time or place, and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name, which are all components of a 100 percent evaluation. 

Taken together, this evidence weighs against a determination that the Veteran experienced total occupational and social impairment as due to his service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder. Accordingly, a rating in excess of 70 percent for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety, and depressed mood, is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F. 4th at 776.

With regards to an earlier effective date, as discussed above, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of the case: (1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)); (2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)); or (3) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)).

The Board finds there is no medical evidence showing an increase in severity of a psychiatric disability within one year of the November 2021 supplemental claim (from November 2020). Thus, the effective date of the rating increase is November 24, 2021, the date the Veteran filed his supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).
