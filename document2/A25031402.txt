FINDINGS OF FACT

3. The criteria for a clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for hydrophil have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1162, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.810.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the Army from December 1985 to December 1988.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2020 determination made by the Prosthetics & Sensory Aids Service under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In October 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2020 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes that the Veteran indicated he wished to appeal the issue of a clothing allowance for shoe prosthetics (orthotics).  See October 2020 VA Form 10182.  However, the Veteran did not apply for a clothing allowance in shoe prosthetics in 2020.  See March 2020 VA Form 10-8678, Application for Annual Clothing Allowance.  Thus, the October 2020 VHA decision did not address this issue, and this issue is not before the Board.

1.  - 3. Clindamycin Phosphate, Hydrocortisone, and Hydrophil

The Veteran seeks clothing allowances for three topical skin medications including clindamycin phosphate, hydrocortisone, and hydrophil.  See March 2020 VA Form 10-8678, Application for Annual Clothing Allowance.  

Legal Criteria

The law provides for payment of an annual clothing allowance for each Veteran who, because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance which VA determines tends to wear out or tear the clothing of the Veteran or uses medication which a physician has prescribed for a skin condition which is due to a service-connected disability and VA determines causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer garments.  38 U.S.C. § 1162.

The implementing regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.810, provides, in pertinent part, that an annual clothing allowance may be granted when the Under Secretary for Health or a designee certifies that a Veteran, because of a service-connected disability or disabilities, wears or uses one qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair) which tends to wear or tear clothing, or that a veteran uses medication prescribed by a physician for one skin condition, which is due to a service-connected disability, that causes irreparable damage to the Veteran's outer garments.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1)(ii).

A Veteran is entitled to an annual clothing allowance for each such prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair) or medication used by the Veteran if each appliance or medication affects a distinct type of article of clothing or outer garment.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(2).  A Veteran is entitled to two annual clothing allowances if a veteran uses more than one such prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, which together tend to wear or tear a single type of article of clothing or irreparably damage a type of outer garment at an increased rate of damage to the clothing or outer garment due to a second appliance.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(3).

Relevant Facts and Analysis 

The Veteran is service connected for pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB).  See April 2020 Rating Decision - Codesheet.

The Veteran has been prescribed clindamycin phosphate, hydrocortisone, and hydrophil for his skin condition.  See February 2020 VA Medication List, in CAPRI received April 2020.

However, the Board finds that the Veteran's topical skin medications did not cause irreparable damage to his clothing.  In this regard, the VHA Handbook provides that a guide and updated listing created by the Prosthetic and Pharmacy workgroup identifies skin medications, ointments, or lotions that may cause irreparable staining, discoloration, bleeding, and damage not removable by laundering or dry cleaning.  See VHA Handbook 1173.15 paragraph 8(c).  It references a guide and updated listing created by the Orthotic and Prosthetic and Pharmacy workgroup.  This guide identifies several skin medications and ointments which are considered to cause irreparable damage to clothing.  However, those listed by the Veteran in his clothing allowance claim, including, clindamycin phosphate, hydrocortisone, and hydrophil are not considered as skin medications that may stain or damage clothing.

Additionally, the Board notes that the AOJ granted a clothing allowance for chlorhexidine gluconate for a service-connected skin condition in the September 2020 decision.  See September 2020 VHA Decision.  As such, the Veteran has received a clothing allowance for topical medication involving a service-connected skin condition that causes damage to his shirts.  The Board has also granted a second clothing allowance for the Veteran's back brace due to damage caused to his shirts in the decision below.  Thus, the Veteran has been awarded the maximum allowable number of clothing allowances for that type of clothing.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810 (a)(3). 

As the evidence is not in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine enunciated in 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) is inapplicable.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Accordingly, the claims for additional clothing allowances for the year of 2020 due to the use of clindamycin phosphate, hydrocortisone, and hydrophil are denied.

4. Back Brace 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a clothing allowance for back brace because it "leaves a ring around the middle of my shirts.  Also makes materials soft on sides and [shirts rip.]"  See October 2020 VA Form 10182.

The Veteran's VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran was issued a Lumboloc Forte XT back brace for his service-connected lumbar spine disability.  See July 2018 VA Appliance Repair Line-Item Detail; April 2020 Rating Decision -Codesheet.  

The AOJ denied the Veteran's clothing allowance for a back brace due to finding that the back brace "did not meet the national criteria for a device that damages clothing."  See September 2020 AOJ Decision.    

The Veteran is competent to observe damage caused to his clothing by his brace, and the Board finds he is credible.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Board therefore finds that the Veteran's statements are highly probative. 

Thus, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that the Veteran's back brace, used for service-connected disability, in the year 2020, tended to cause wear or tear to his clothing, and specifically his shirts.  Although the AOJ determined that the Veteran's back brace did not meet the criteria for a device that would cause irreparable damage to clothing, the AOJ did not provide an explanation as to which national standards or how it determined his back brace would not cause damage to his clothing.  There is no other evidence weighing against the Veteran's claim.

As the evidence is in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine enunciated in 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) is applicable.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Accordingly, the claim for entitlement to a clothing allowance for a back brace for the year 2020 is granted.

5. Topical Medication for Back Pain

The Veteran seeks a clothing allowance for a topical medication for his back pain.  See October 2020 VA Form 10182. 

VA treatment records confirm that the Veteran was prescribed Diclofenac gel.  See February 2020 VA Medication List, in CAPRI received April 2020.

The Veteran is service connected for a lumbar spine disability.  See April 2020 Rating Decision - Codesheet.  As noted above, the Veteran has been granted clothing allowances for skin medication and for his back brace.  

Notably, a clothing allowance based on the use of topical skin medication may only be granted if the topical medication is for a skin condition due to a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810 (a)(1).  There is no provision for a clothing allowance based on the use of topical medication for a condition other than a skin condition such as a lumbar spine disability.

As the evidence is not in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine enunciated in 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) is inapplicable.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Consequently, the claim for a clothing allowance for topical medication for back pain must therefore be denied as a matter of law.
