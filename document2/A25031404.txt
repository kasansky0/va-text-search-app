DOCKET NO. 210106-134931
DATE: April 4, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of the cost of ambulance transportation to a VA hospital is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from October 1982 to September 1985 and from February 1988 to February 1989. She had additional Army National Guard service between August 1987 and July 1992.

In the January 6, 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of the cost of ambulance transportation to a VA hospital is remanded.

The Veteran is seeking payment or reimbursement of the cost of ambulance transportation. She indicated that her claim was denied in a November 12, 2020 decision. 

The Board finds that remand is necessary to obtain a copy of the complete record before the AOJ at the time the decision on appeal was rendered. Decisions of the Board must be based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal, and any additional evidence considered as part of the evidentiary record pursuant to applicable statute and regulation. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (d), 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

Currently, the Veteran's electronic file does not contain a Beneficiary Travel or VHA file. As such, the file does not include the decision on appeal, the claim for benefits, any medical or lay records VHA relied upon in its determination, and any notification provided to the Veteran. 

With the missing information, the Board does not know the date of the episode of care on appeal. On her VA Form 10182, she stated that her ambulance ride was undertaken in an emergent situation, and that EMS informed her she could not drive because she was at risk of losing consciousness ("passing out"). However, she stated she requested that the ambulance transport her to a VA hospital. The ambulance records and VA treatment records related to this incident are not of record. 

Remand is necessary to obtain all relevant evidence. Without the AOJ decision on appeal, the Board cannot determine the basis of the denial, the laws under which the claim was denied, any AOJ findings favorable to the appellant, or what evidence was considered, all of which are required to be in a decision of the AOJ. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 511 (a), 5104(b).

If a copy of the decision being appealed cannot be associated with the electronic record, the Veteran must be provided with notice of the decision that explains the basis of the denial of benefits, and a copy of this must be associated with the claim file. For any missing records, a memorandum of unavailability must be provided.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Associate with the Veteran's electronic file all records associated with the November 2020 ambulance travel claim on appeal, including the claim for benefits, original decision denying entitlement for the cost of ambulance travel, notice provided to the Veteran of the decision on appeal as described in 38 U.S.C. §5104 (b), and any medical or lay evidence relied upon in rendering the decision.
