REMANDED

A total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities from May 31, 2024, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran, who is the appellant, had service from December 1955 to November 1957.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. A total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities from May 31, 2024, to July 11, 2024, is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to TDIU is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the July 2024 rating decision on appeal.  The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) requested medical opinions without need for examinations for the service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder, GERD, and peptic ulcer disease prior to the July 2024 rating decision on appeal. See June 11, 2024 Exam Scheduling Request Clarification Response. However, a June 17, 2024, examination scheduling request stated the acquired psychiatric disorder examination was cancelled because the Veteran was unable to be contacted by VA. The Board notes the request to obtain a psychiatric medical opinion did not require an examination and there is no explanation as to why there was a need to contact the Veteran for the psychiatric disability when his other service-connected disabilities, which had the same instructions in the June 11, 2024 exam scheduling request clarification response, were able to obtain medical opinions. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

(Continued on the next page)

?

Obtain a medical opinion by an appropriate clinician regarding the current severity of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder.  The examiner should comment on the effect of the Veteran's service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder on his ability to function in an occupational environment and describe any identified functional limitations. Please refrain from opining on if the Veteran is unemployable or employable; instead focus and reflect on the functional impairments and how these impairments impact occupational and employment activities. The examiner should discuss the complete educational, vocational, and employment history and should note any complaints regarding the impact of the service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder on employment.  The examiner should identify all limitations or functional impairment caused solely by the acquired psychiatric disorder.
