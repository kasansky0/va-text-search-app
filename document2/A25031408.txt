DOCKET NO. 240730-458353
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability, claimed as degenerative disc disease (DDD), intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS), and spinal stenosis, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The competent and credible medical evidence of-record persuasively weighs in favor of the Veteran's claim that his current neck disability is caused by, or otherwise had its onset during, his active-duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a cervical spine disability, claimed as DDD, IVDS, and spinal stenosis, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R.     §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps from June 1999 to June 2004.

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) May 2024 rating decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). As a procedural matter, the Board notes that the AOJ has established that new and relevant evidence necessary to reopen the Veteran's claims has been received, and that the Veteran has a currently diagnosed neck disability. Therefore, the Board will not disturb those findings.

In his July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. This restricts the Board's review to the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 rating decision. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Service Connection

Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability, claimed as degenerative disc disease, IVDS, and spinal stenosis is granted.

The Veteran contends that his cervical spine disability is caused by, or otherwise due to, his military service. See July 2024 VA Form 10182. For the reasons below, the Board agrees and finds that service connection is warranted.

Generally, service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection basically means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with active service in the Armed Forces; or, if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500 (1994) (noting that, in the context of service-connected disability compensation, "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty").

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give benefit of the doubt to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Here, the Board finds that the first two Shedden elements have been met. The Veteran's post-service medical records, to include several VA examinations, have determined that the Veteran has DDD, IVDS, and spinal stenosis in his cervical spine. See April 2022 C&P Exam. Furthermore, the evidence shows that the Veteran experienced an in-service parachuting accident, and in July 2002 the Veteran complained of pain and stiffness in his neck and shoulder. See June 2014 STR - Medical. 

Thus, the Board must determine whether the Veteran's current neck disabilities are caused by, due to, or otherwise related to his in-service accident and complaints of neck pain. For the reasons addressed below, the Board agrees with the Veteran, and service connection for a cervical spine disability is warranted.

During the period on appeal the Veteran had been seen for several VA examinations to determine the etiology of his cervical spine disability. These examinations were in April 2022, October 2022, March 2023 (with an addendum opinion in April 2023), and in April 2023. At all of these examinations, the Veteran provided the same medical history. Namely, that he began experiencing pain in his neck at the time of his March 2001 parachuting accident and he has continued to experience pain and other symptoms since then. However, every VA examiner found against the Veteran on the basis that there was no record of any neck injury following the accident in his service treatment records (STRs). 

The Board finds that these etiology opinions are inadequate for adjudication for three reasons. First, as noted above, in July 2002 the Veteran did present for treatment with a report of stiffness and pain in his neck (along with in his shoulder). Second, setting aside the factual incorrectness of the findings that the Veteran did not seek treatment for his neck in-service, VA examiners cannot rely on the absence of evidence as negative evidence. Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272-75 (2015). Finally, none of the examiners addressed the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset of his neck symptoms. While the Veteran, as a medical layman, cannot provide evidence as to the etiology of his neck disabilities, he is capable of providing evidence as to the symptoms he experiences, including their onset and continuity. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).

The improper application of the legal standard, with factually inaccurate summations of the Veteran's STRs, and the failure to address relevant lay evidence, render each of the VA etiology opinions of-record inadequate for adjudication. Barr v. Nicholson  21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). 

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a statement from Dr. C.S., a non-VA physician who had been treating the Veteran. According to Dr. C.S., the Veteran reported experiencing pain in his neck following his accident. However, "the neck pain was overshadowed by his low back symptoms," leading to treatments focusing more on his back, but "both [conditions] have been present for many years." See February 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. According to Dr. C.S., the Veteran's neck disabilities "are most likely caused by the prior trauma to the neck related to the parachute injury." Id. 

While the rationale of Dr. C.S.'s is admittedly thin on details, it is ultimately credible and sufficiently probative. It addresses the Veteran's medical history, his lay reports regarding his symptoms, and provides an adequate nexus opinion regarding his current disability. Bostain v. West, 11 Vet. App. 124 (1998). This, combined with the Veteran's lay reports of the onset and continuity of the symptoms establishes the third Shedden element necessary for service connection.

Therefore, with the evidence weighing persuasively in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's cervical spine disability, diagnosed as DDD, IVDS, and spinal stenosis, is caused by, or otherwise due to, his active-duty service.
