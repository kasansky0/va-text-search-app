ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a disability manifested by high cholesterol is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus had its onset during service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Marine Corps from November 1978 to January 1986.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review in the June 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the February 2024 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, hypertension, and a disability manifested by high cholesterol, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that it has expanded the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for high cholesterol to one of entitlement to service connection for a disability manifested by high cholesterol, based on the Veteran's lay statements. See, e.g., September 2023 VA Form 21-10210; see also Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (indicating that the scope of a disability claim includes any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record).

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

Legal Principles

Service connection may be granted for disability due to disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304. Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) a disease, injury, or event in service; and (3) a nexus or causal relationship between the claimed disability and the disease, injury, or event in service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, such as organic diseases of the nervous system like tinnitus, will be presumed related to service if they were noted as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if continuity of the same symptomatology has existed since service, with no intervening cause. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a).

The presumption for chronic diseases relaxes the evidentiary requirements for establishing entitlement to service connection. Walker, 708 F.3d at 1338 (holding that "[t]he clear purpose of [subsection 3.303(b)] is to relax the requirements of § 3.303(a) for establishing service connection for certain chronic diseases" and only applies to the chronic diseases set forth in §3.309(a)). As noted, § 3.303(b) provides that when a chronic disease is established during active service, then subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, will be entitled to service connection, unless clearly attributable to causes unrelated to service ("intercurrent causes"). If the evidence is not sufficient to show that the disease was chronic at the time of service, then the claim may be established with evidence of a continuity of symptoms after service, which is a distinct and lesser evidentiary burden than the nexus element of the three-part test under Shedden. Walker, 708 F.3d at 1338; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). Showing a continuity of symptoms after service itself "establishes the link, or nexus" to service and also "confirm[s] the existence of the chronic disease while in service or [during a] presumptive period."

Additionally, service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that a disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Relevant Facts and Analysis

The Veteran contends that his tinnitus should be service connected because he has experienced ringing in the ears since he served in the military. See September 2023 VA Form 21-10210. A layperson is competent to report symptoms of which he has personal knowledge, derived from his own senses, such as the subjective experience of tinnitus. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). This statement seems to be in conflict with a statement recorded on the February 2024 VA examination (discussed below); for this reason, with respect to the statement about tinnitus, the Board finds that it is somewhat credible and affords it some probative weight.

In the June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the following favorable findings that the Board will not disturb: (1) The Veteran has been diagnosed with tinnitus. (2) Hazardous noise exposure is conceded based on the duties associated with the Veteran's occupational specialty. Consequently, the following analysis will focus only on the element of nexus.

In February 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for tinnitus. See February 2024 C&P (Compensation and Pension) Examination. The examiner evidence comments referenced the Veteran statement that tinnitus had been present since service. The medical history indicated that the Veteran stated that he could not recall if he heard tinnitus during service, but that he began to notice it approximately two years prior to the examination when the Veteran's son began to point out that the Veteran was not hearing well. Id., p. 5. The examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely caused by military noise exposure because of the statements on the day of the examination. Id. The examiner also opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely related to conceded toxic exposure. See June 2024 Rating Decision, February 2024 C&P Examination (medical opinion). The examiner relied upon the absence of in-service treatment to support the conclusions. Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231 (2012). The examiner did not sufficiently consider the Veteran's lay statement that tinnitus had been present since service. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). The Board finds that the opinion is somewhat credible and affords it some probative weight.

The Board finds that the evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus had its onset in service, and as to whether continuity of symptomatology of tinnitus existed since service. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the presumption for chronic diseases provides the necessary nexus based on the Veteran's reported continuity of symptomatology. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). Therefore, service connection for tinnitus is granted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his vertigo is caused by tinnitus. See September 2023 VA Form 21-10210. In the alternative, the Veteran contends that his vertigo is directly related to service because he began experiencing the symptoms of vertigo in service. See February 2025 C&P Examination (ear conditions disability benefits questionnaire).

The Veteran also contends that his hypertension is caused by toxic exposure. In the alternative, the Veteran contends that hypertension is caused by the stress he experienced in the military. See September 2023 VA Form 21-10210.

Notably, the Veteran stated that he was treated at Bay Front Medical for vertigo. See September 2023 VA Form 21-10210. There is no indication in the claims file that the AOJ attempted to obtain these records, which may be relevant with regard to the vertigo and hypertension appeals.

The fact that the AOJ did not attempt to obtain records from Bay Front Medical constitutes pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The evidence is not sufficient to grant the claim; thus, remand is necessary.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a disability manifested by high cholesterol is remanded.

Legal Principles

Pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), effective August 10, 2022, unless an exception applies, VA is required to provide a disability examination when a Veteran submits a claim for service connection and has: (1) evidence of a disability; (2) participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) in service; and (3) the evidence is not sufficient to grant service connection for the disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a).

Relevant Facts and Analysis

The Veteran contends that his high cholesterol is caused by the stress on his body and the exposure he faced in the military. See September 2023 VA Form 21-10210.

In the June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the following favorable finding: participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded.

The Board notes that, historically, VA has considered a diagnosis of high cholesterol or hyperlipidemia, in and of itself, to be merely a laboratory finding, which is not by itself a disability for which VA compensation benefits are payable. See, e.g., 61 Fed. Reg. 20,440, 20,445 (May 7, 1996) (indicating that "diagnoses" such as hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, and elevated cholesterol levels are actually laboratory results and not, in and of themselves, disabilities that are appropriate entities for the rating schedule).

Here, the Veteran stated that the stress on his body and the exposure he faced in the military caused high cholesterol, and indicated that he takes medication for high cholesterol. See September 2023 VA Form 21-10210. The Board finds that the totality of the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the low threshold for a TERA examination, to include a determination as to whether there is an underlying condition that may have caused hyperlipidemia.

The AOJ should have provided a VA examination and obtained an etiology opinion prior to adjudication. The fact that the AOJ did not complete this task constitutes pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The evidence is not sufficient to grant the claim; thus, remand is necessary.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Make appropriate efforts to obtain the Veteran's records from Bay Front Medical (as referenced in the September 11, 2023, VA Form 21-10210), and add them to the claims file.

2. After the above development is complete, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine whether he has a disability manifested by high cholesterol. The examiner must review the claims file. In completing the disability benefits questionnaire(s), the provider should order tests and imaging, as appropriate, to obtain any and all diagnostic information that has a possibility of pertaining to the Veteran's claim. The examiner should elicit a detailed and complete medical history that is directly relevant to the claimed condition and service records.

(a.) First, identify and diagnose all current disabilities relating to the reported symptoms. If the examiner cannot provide a diagnosis, the examiner should explain, in detail, why a diagnosis is not possible, and provide an opinion, supported by rationale, as to the cause or causes of the Veteran's reported symptoms.

(b.) Thereafter, the examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

Direct Service Connection: For each disability identified in (a), is it at least as likely as not that the disability had onset in service, or is otherwise related to service? The examiner should specifically consider and address the Veteran's statement in the September 11, 2023, VA Form 21-10210: "High Cholesterol: I have also been diagnosed with high cholesterol from the stress on my body and the exposure I faced. I also take medication for this."

Secondary Service Connection - Causation: For each disability identified in (a), is it at least as likely as not that the disability was caused by, or is otherwise due to, a service-connected disability, or due to two or more service-connected disabilities in combination?

Secondary Service Connection - Aggravation: For each disability identified in (a), is it at least as likely as not that the disability was aggravated (i.e., worsened) by a service-connected disability, or due to two or more service-connected disabilities in combination?

TERA Opinion: For each disability identified in (a), is the disability at least as likely as not related to potential exposure due to his military occupational specialty (Antitank Assaultman) and the other conceded exposures? In addressing the reported exposures, the clinician should consider: (1) the total potential exposure of the Veteran; and (2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

Provide rationale to support the opinions.

The requested opinions should reflect consideration of the Veteran's description of any in-service symptoms as well as post-service symptoms. If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that a reported injury and symptoms in service and thereafter represented the onset of the current disability, this should be noted. Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about the symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?

The examiner in each instance is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions reached. The examiner is reminded that the term "at least as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility," but rather that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher. Note that the lack of documented treatment in service, or a long period after, while probative, cannot serve as the sole basis for a negative finding. The Veteran's lay contentions must be considered and weighed in making the determination.
