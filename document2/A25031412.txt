ORDER

An effective date prior to September 11, 2020 for service connection for lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) is denied.

An effective date prior to September 11, 2020 for service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy is denied.

An effective date prior to September 11, 2020 for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy is denied.

An effective date prior to September 11, 2020 for service connection for tinnitus is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In April 2017, the Veteran's claims for entitlement to service connection for chronic back pain and tinnitus were denied by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran did not appeal the claim within one year. Additionally, no new and material evidence was received within one year. Therefore, the April 2017 rating decision became final.

2. On September 11, 2020, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File. 

3. In June 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application seeking readjudication of the April 2017 rating decision, which was within a year of the submission of his Intent to File.  

4. In July 2021, the RO granted service connection for IVDS, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and tinnitus, and assigned June 24, 2021 as the effective date for each condition. 

5. Following the issuance of the July 2021 rating decision, in August 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Higher Level Request seeking an earlier effective date based on the date he submitted the Intent to File.

6.  In October 2021, the RO denied the claim for an earlier effective date prior to June 24, 2021 for service connection for each disability. Thereafter, in the same month, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application seeking an earlier effective date based on the date he submitted the Intent to File. In March 2022, the RO again denied an effective date earlier than June 24, 2021.

7. In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement and appealed the October 2021 rating decision. 

8. In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Higher Level Request seeking review of the March 2022 rating decision. Thereafter, in May 2023, the RO issued a higher-level review rating decision that again denied an earlier effective date for service connection for each condition. In response, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement and appealed the May 2023 rating decision.

9. In February 2025, the Board granted an earlier effective date of September 11, 2020, but no earlier, for the service connection awards for IVDS, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and tinnitus.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 11, 2020 for service connection for IVDS are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 11, 2020 for service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 11, 2020 for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.400.

4. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 11, 2020 for service connection for tinnitus are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1998 to October 2007. This matter comes before the Board of Veteran's Appeal (Board) on appeal from an October 2021 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

As detailed in the Findings of Fact section, in September 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and selected the Direct Review docket at the Board.

Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of October 7, 2021-the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after October 7, 2021, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

As a final introductory note, the Board acknowledges that the October 2021 rating decision on appeal denied an effective date prior to June 24, 2021 for service connection for these conditions. However, in February 2025, the Board granted an earlier effective date of September 11, 2020 for the awards of service connection for the IVDS, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and tinnitus conditions. See February 2025 BVA Decision. The Board recognizes that it is precluded from considering evidence submitted after the October 2021 rating decision. The Board finds that the February 2025 Board decision does not constitute evidence. See Green v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 127, 138 (2024) (holding that an agency decision which post-dates the decision does not constitute "evidence" and as such, the decision need not have been of record at the time of the decision on appeal). Accordingly, the Board finds that the question presented in this case is whether the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date prior to September 11, 2020 for the awards of service connection for the IVDS, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and tinnitus conditions.

Earlier Effective Date

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the effective date for an award of a compensation based on an initial claim is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 

As indicated above in the Conclusions of Law section, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than September 11, 2020 is not warranted for the awards of service connection for the IVDS, left lower extremity radiculopathy, right lower extremity radiculopathy, and tinnitus. Accordingly, the Board denies the Veteran's claims.

Here, the Veteran, through his representative argues that evidence was received within one year of the previous final denial, which was not reviewed in the context of determining whether he is entitled to an earlier effective date. Alternatively, the Veteran contended that his Intent to File form was received August 21, 2020.

Turning to the procedural history detailed in the Findings of Fact section, the Board finds that there was no relevant evidence received within one year of the April 2017 rating decision. Specifically, although it appears that treatment records from the Richmond VA Medical Center were added to the claims file after this rating decision, a careful review of this rating decision shows that these treatment records were considered by the RO in the February 2017 rating decision.  See April 2017 Rating Decision. Further, the Veteran did not appeal this decision. Accordingly, the April 2017 rating decision finalized.

Additionally, the record also demonstrates that the Veteran did not submit any new claims until September 2020, when he filed his Intent to File form. Although he reported that he filed this form on August 21, 2020, the record shows that VA did not receive the form until September 11, 2020. See September 2020 VA Form 21-0966. Within one year of receipt of this form, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application in June 2021, which sought service connection for tinnitus, a lumbar spine disability, and bilateral lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy. Accordingly, the earlier effective date of September 11, 2020, is preserved pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, September 11, 2020 is the appropriate effective date for service connection for these conditions, as it is the date of claim. Accordingly, the Board finds that an effective date prior to September 11, 2020 for service connection for IVDS, left lower extremity radiculopathy, right lower extremity radiculopathy, and tinnitus is not warranted.
