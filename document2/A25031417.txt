DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the Veteran's treatment by a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility on May 1, 2019, is dismissed. 

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the Veteran's treatment by a non-VA facility on May 7, 2019, is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

While the appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved the Appellant's claims for payment or reimbursement for the Veteran's treatment that was provided on May 1, 2019, and May 7, 2019. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal regarding non-VA treatment on May 1, 2019, are met. 38?U.S.C. §?7105; 38?C.F.R. §?20.801. 

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal regarding non-VA treatment on May 7, 2019, are met. 38?U.S.C. §?7105; 38?C.F.R. §?20.801. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1982 to October 1986. These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from decisions rendered in November and December 2020. The Appellant is a non-VA provider.

The Appellant filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal in December 2020 and selected the Evidence Submission docket.

The record indicates that these claims were originally denied on the basis that the episodes of care in question were not pre-authorized. However, on secondary review, an authorization was found. A letter was sent to the Appellant informing it that the claims were granted. 

The administrative action approving payment for the treatment in question constitutes a complete grant of the benefits sought. As a result, no determination remains with which the Appellant disagrees, and the appeal is dismissed. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(d); 38?C.F.R. §?20.801(b).
