REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for retinopathy or maculopathy (claimed as a vision condition) is remanded. 

Entitlement to service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder (claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1979 to November 1996, from October 2001 to October 2003, and from August 2007 to September 2008. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the July 5, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of November 6, 2023-the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after November 6, 2023, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

1. Entitlement to service connection for retinopathy or maculopathy (claimed as a vision condition) is remanded. 

The Board finds that a remand of the claim for service connection for retinopathy/ maculopathy also claimed as service connection for a vision condition is warranted. 

In the Veteran's VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran disagreed with the denial of his claim for service connection of an "eye condition sec(ondary) to diabetic condition" and listed the date of decision as "12/14/2023". See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement received 7/05/2024 at page 1. 

A review of the record shows that the RO did not address or take any action on his claim for service connection for an eye condition in its December 2023 rating decision since it found that the claim was not filed on the prescribed form. See Rating Decision received 12/13/2023 at page 1. By way of background, in April 2023, the Veteran applied for service connection for an eye condition on a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) form. However, because his eye condition claim was previously denied in a June 2017 rating decision, the RO informed the Veteran in a December 14, 2023 letter that he needed to apply to re-adjudicate the claim via the proper form (i.e., a Supplemental Claim form and submit new and relevant evidence under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)).  

The RO cited to notice and an opportunity to correct the filing in two letters, a Request or Application AMA Review Letter in April 2023, and HLR Not Timely Letter that was sent in May 2024. However, the Board finds that both notices were insufficient because they did not expressly state that the claim for entitlement to service connection for an eye condition was on an improper form but instead only addressed a hearing loss issue or were vague. 38 U.S.C. § 5104; 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(c).  Since the Board finds that there was improper notice of the inadequacy of his filing, the Board will remand this claim for proper notice to the Veteran and to give him an opportunity to respond. See 38 C.F.R. §20.802(a) ("The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.").  

2. Entitlement to service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder (claimed as PTSD) is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he has PTSD that was incurred during his service in Iraq. See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) received 4/19/2023 at page 3. In the August 2023 VA examination, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with unspecified anxiety disorder, and found that the Veteran did not met the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. Accordingly, the Board finds that this claim should be expanded to include the only diagnosed mental health condition, unspecified anxiety disorder. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 4-6 (2009) (holding that the scope of a mental health disability includes any mental health disability that is reasonably raised by the other information in the record).  

The Board finds that there has been a pre-decisional duty to assist error that occurred prior to the decision on appeal in not providing a medical opinion on whether the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder is related to his service. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The duty to assist includes providing a medical examination or medical opinion when necessary to decide on a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). In this case, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder. The Board finds that there is insufficient medical evidence to decide the claim since the August 2023 VA examiner did not opine on whether his diagnosed unspecified anxiety disorder was related to service. Accordingly, the Board must remand the issue so that a medical opinion addressing the etiology of the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder can be obtained. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

These matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Send the Veteran and his authorized representative a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, for his retinopathy or maculopathy (claimed as a vision condition).

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to his service, such as the in-service event noted on the April 2023 VA 21-0781.

A comprehensive rationale for all opinions is to be provided.  All pertinent evidence, including both lay and medical, should be considered.  If an opinion cannot be given without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why and state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
