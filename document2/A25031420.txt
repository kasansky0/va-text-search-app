ORDER

Recognition of the appellant as the Veteran's surviving spouse for the purpose of establishing eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The appellant and the Veteran were divorced prior to his death in December 1999.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for recognition of the appellant as the surviving spouse of the Veteran for the purpose of establishing eligibility for VA benefits have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 103, 1102, 1304, 1541, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.50, 3.52, 3.53, 3.54, 3.205, 3.206.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Army from July 1986 to May 1998.  He died in December 1999.  The appellant seeks recognition as the Veteran's surviving spouse for the purpose of establishing eligibility for VA benefits.  

As an initial matter, the Board notes that a different individual, C.I., has been previously recognized as the Veteran's surviving spouse and is receiving VA death benefits.  See May 11, 2000, decision letter.  VA's regulations allow for only one person to be considered a surviving spouse.  38 C.F.R. § 3.50(a).  Accordingly, a favorable determination on the appellant's present claim seeking entitlement to recognition as the Veteran's surviving spouse for the purpose of entitlement to VA benefits would result in the disallowance of C.I.'s current award of DIC benefits.  Thus, this appeal is a "simultaneously contested claim" requiring compliance with additional regulations.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.100-19.102, 20.3(l), 20.400-20.407, 20.500-20.505, 20.711.  Here, on February 23, 2025, C.I. was sent a letter advising her that the appellant's appeal had been docketed, providing her with a redacted copy of the appellant's VA Form 10182, and providing her with 30 days to file a brief, submit argument, or submit a Board appeal request.  No response was received.  The appellant was also advised via a February 23, 2025, letter that C.I. was a contesting claimant.  Thus, the Board finds that all notice procedures required in simultaneously contested claims have been completed, and the Board can proceed with appellate review.           

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from an April 2023 decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO); the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the June 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Recognition of the appellant as the Veteran's surviving spouse for the purpose of establishing eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits is denied.

The appellant seeks recognition as the surviving spouse of the Veteran for the purpose of establishing eligibility to receive VA death benefits.  For the reason explained below, the Board finds that the criteria to recognize her as the Veteran's surviving spouse are not met.

Under VA law, a surviving spouse of a veteran may qualify for dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) benefits, death compensation, death pension, and/or accrued benefits, collectively known as death benefits, provided that certain requirements are satisfied.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(14), 1102(a)(2), 1310, 1311, 1541; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.4, 3.5, 3.54, 3.1000.

The law provides that VA death benefits may be paid to a surviving spouse who was married to a veteran: (1) one year or more prior to a veteran's death, or (2) for any period of time if a child was born of the marriage, or (3) was born to them before the marriage.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1102, 1304, 1541; 38 C.F.R. § 3.54.  The term "surviving spouse" means a person who was the spouse of the veteran at the time of a veteran's death, and who lived with the veteran continuously from the date of marriage to the date of a veteran's death (except where there was a separation which was due to the misconduct of, or procured by, a veteran without the fault of the spouse in the case of temporary separations) and who has not remarried or (in cases not involving remarriage) has not since the death of a veteran lived with another person and held himself or herself out openly to the public to be the spouse of such other person.  See 38 U.S.C. § 101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.50.

For purposes of VA benefits, a marriage means a marriage valid under law of the place where the parties resided at the time of the marriage, or the law of the place where the parties resided when the right to benefits accrued.  38 U.S.C. § 103(c); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(j).

In this case, the appellant filed an application for DIC benefits in March 2023 listing herself as the surviving spouse of the Veteran and indicating that they had married in October 1979 and divorced in September 1997.  She indicated that she had not lived continuously with the Veteran from the date of their marriage until his death.  Moreover, a finalized divorce decree between the Veteran and appellant is of record confirming that they divorced in September 1997.  Thus, the appellant does not dispute that she and the Veteran had divorced prior to his death.  She argues, rather, in a June 2023 statement, that she is entitled to death benefits due to the length of her marriage to the Veteran.  However, as the Veteran and appellant were divorced at the time of his death, the Board finds that the appellant cannot be recognized as the Veteran's surviving spouse for the purpose of establishing eligibility for VA death benefits.  

The Board is sympathetic to the appellant's claim for benefits.  However, the Board is bound by the law and is without authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104 (2012); Burris v. Wilkie, 888 F.3d 1352, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding that "§ 503 provides the Secretary with the authority to grant the precise relief that Appellants request here [payment of moneys], and the Secretary has not delegated that authority").

Accordingly, the Board finds that, as the Veteran and the appellant were validly divorced prior to the Veteran's death, the appellant cannot, as a matter of law, be considered the Veteran's surviving spouse under 38 U.S.C. § 101(3) or 38 C.F.R. § 3.50(b).  Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable, and the claim must be denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
