REMANDED

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 70 percent for generalized anxiety disorder, with panic, borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder unspecified is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the Arkansas Army National Guard from September 2019 to September 2022.  In particular, the Veteran served on active duty from July 2020 to December 2020 on Army National Guard Initial Entry Training and had additional unverified periods of active duty and inactive duty training.

The rating decisions on appeal was issued in February 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the Veteran's claim for an increased disability rating, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

As a preliminary matter, an August 2023 Rating Decision granted service connection for generalized anxiety disorder, with panic and borderline personality disorder, and assigned a 70 percent disability rating, effective April 18, 2023.  Within one year of that decision, the Veteran filed an October 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, which listed a claim for an increased disability rating for generalized anxiety disorder, with panic and borderline personality disorder.  Thereafter, a February 2024 Rating Decision denied an increased disability rating.  The June 2024 VA Form 10182 expressed disagreement with both the August 2023 and February 2024 rating decisions.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 4 (2023) (holding that a claimant may file more than one administrative review request of an initial AOJ decision if the first request for administrative review is no longer pending, and if the second request is filed within one year of the decision on appeal).

The Board notes that under the AMA, a claim for an increased rating on a VA Form 21-526EZ is an "initial claim" that requests a higher rating based on a change or worsening of the condition and should not be interpreted as requesting review of a rating assigned in a prior decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(1) (defining a claim for increased rating as an "initial claim" rather than a supplemental claim); see 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(b).  Accordingly, in the AMA, when a claimant files an increased rating claim on a VA Form 21-526EZ, the AOJ should consider the appropriate rating for the service-connected disability for the period from receipt of the claim through the issuance of the decision on the claim (to include the 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o) one-year lookback period, when appropriate).  Moreover, a VA Form 21-526EZ does not maintain continuous pursuit of the prior claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  Instead, if a claimant would like to continuously pursue a rating assigned in a prior decision, within a year of issuance of that decision, they should file a VA Form 21-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, VA Form 21-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, or VA Form 10182, Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a).

Here, given that the October 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ was received a little over two months following the August 2023 Rating Decision, and the Veteran did not advise of any change or worsening of her generalized anxiety disorder, with panic and borderline personality disorder at that time, the Board will construe her submission to be a Supplemental Claim seeking review of the August 2023 Rating Decision and not an "initial claim" that requests an increased rating based on a change or worsening of the condition.  See Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028.  Thus, the claim is accepted as on appeal from the February 2024 rating decision, which is more beneficial to the Veteran as it allows for consideration of all evidence of record at the time of notification of that decision.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 70 percent for generalized anxiety disorder, with panic, borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder unspecified is remanded.

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the claimant under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The Veteran was afforded a VA Mental Disorders Disability Benefits Questionnaire in November 2023.  The examination report indicates that the Veteran reported that she was scheduled to begin seeing a therapist.  The Veteran's claims file does not contain these private treatment records or demonstrate that the AOJ attempted to obtain these records.

The AOJ's failure to attempt to obtain the Veteran's private treatment records amounts to a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  A remand is required to allow VA to obtain authorization and request these records.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for physicians and/or facilities relating to therapy she receives or received for her generalized anxiety disorder, with panic, borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder unspecified.  Make two requests for the authorized records from any adequately identified physicians and/or facilities, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.
