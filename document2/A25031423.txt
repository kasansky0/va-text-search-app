REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1989 to March 2000. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in December 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

By way of background, the RO issued a January 2001 rating decision that granted service connection for right and left knee degenerative arthritis at 10 percent, both effective March 22, 2000. See 1/26/2001 Rating Decision. The Veteran filed for an increase of left and right knee disability ratings on August 13, 2023. 8/13/2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. The Veteran's claims were denied in a December 22, 2023 rating decision, which is the subject of the present appeal. See 12/22/2023 Rating Decision.  

In the June 6, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran referenced the December 2023 decision and elected the Direct Review docket.  Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of December 22, 2023-the date of the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after December 22, 2023, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The Board notes that in the June 6, 2024 NOD, the Veteran identified a reduction of his 10 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as an issue on appeal, citing the December 22, 2023 rating decision. See 6/6/2024 NOD. The December 22, 2023 rating decision did not adjudicate or reduce the Veteran's rating for PTSD and the Board sent a notice to the Veteran indicating that the appeal as to the issue of PTSD was not docketed due to timeliness. See 6/17/2024 BVA Untimely Appeal Letter. The issue of an increased rating for PTSD is not, therefore, presently before the Board and will not be addressed in this decision. For clarity, the record shows that the Veteran's 10 percent rating for PTSD, with an original effective date of March 22, 2000, remains in effect and is included in his combined evaluation of 70 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The percentages are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires the use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen.

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided; however, separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one disability is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994); 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by his senses. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a).

1. Entitlement to a non-initial increased rating for left knee degenerative arthritis in excess of 10 percent.

2. Entitlement to a non-initial increased rating for right knee degenerative arthritis in excess of 10 percent.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an increased rating for left and right knee degenerative arthritis because his disabilities have worsened over time and result in painful motion. 8/13/2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; see 9/23/2023 C&P Exam. He added on the 2024 Board NOD that his knees cause an adverse quality of life and he has needed to purchase orthopedic shoes. 

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that ratings in excess of 10 percent for his right and left knee arthritis are not warranted under DC 5260. The Board has also considered whether separate ratings under additional DCs are warranted and finds that, other than for painful extension under DC 5261, they are not. 

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71 (a) (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71(a) [or 4.73] criteria.").

However, a veteran may be entitled to a higher disability evaluation than that supported by mechanical application of the rating schedule where there is evidence that his or her disability causes "additional functional loss i.e., 'the inability... to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination[,] and endurance including as due to pain and/or other factors" or "reduction of a joint's normal excursion of movement in different planes, including changes in the joint's range of movement, strength, fatigability, or coordination." Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107, 117-18 (2017) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and citing 38 C.F.R. § 4.45); Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 36-37; DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 205-07.

The intent of the rating schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint and periarticular pathology as productive of disability. It is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or maligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

Normal flexion of the knee is to 140 degrees, and normal extension of the knee is to 0 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

Under DC 5256, when ankylosis of the knee is present, a 30 percent rating is warranted for favorable angle in full extension, or in slight flexion between 0 and 10 degrees. A 40 percent rating is warranted for flexion between 10 and 20 degrees. A 50 percent rating is warranted for flexion between 20 and 45 degrees. A 60 percent rating, the maximum schedular rating under DC 5256, is warranted for extremely unfavorable ankylosis with flexion at an angle of 45 degrees or more. 

Under DC 5257, for recurrent subluxation or instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted for sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. A 20 percent rating is warranted for one of the following: (a) Sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation; or (b) Unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation.

For patellar instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker. A 20 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: A brace, cane, or walker. A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker.

Note (1) provides that, for patellar instability, the patellofemoral complex consists of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon. Note (2) provides that a surgical procedure that does not involve repair of one or more patellofemoral components that contribute to the underlying instability shall not qualify as a surgical repair for patellar instability (including, but not limited to, arthroscopy to remove loose bodies and joint aspiration). 

Additionally, DC 5258 covers dislocated semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of locking, pain, and effusion into the joint; this warrants a 20 percent rating. DC 5259 covers removal of symptomatic semilunar cartilage, which warrants a 10 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71(a), DCs 5258, 5259.

Under DC 5260, leg flexion limited to 60 degrees warrants a noncompensable rating. Leg flexion limited to 45 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating. Leg flexion limited to 30 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating. Leg flexion limited to 15 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71(a), DC 5260.

Under DC 5261, leg extension limited to 5 degrees warrants a noncompensable rating. Leg extension limited to 10 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating. Leg extension limited to 15 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating. Leg extension limited to 20 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating. Leg extension limited to 30 degrees warrants a 40 percent rating. Leg extension limited to 45 degrees warrants a 50 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71(a), DC 5261.

A knee disability can be rated for both limitation of leg flexion under DC 5260 and limitation of leg extension under DC 5261. See VAOPGCPREC 9-2004 (Sept. 17, 2004). Additionally, General Counsel Opinion 9-98 directs that with respect to Diagnostic Code 5259, limitation of motion can be a relevant consideration so the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and 4.45 must be considered.

The Veteran may also be rated under DC 5262 for impairment of the tibia and fibula and under DC 5263 for genu recurvatum. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71(a), DCs 5262, 5263.

The Veteran is currently rated under DCs 5003-5260 for his right knee and under DCs 5010-5260 for his left knee. The Board notes that the RO has assigned DC 5010, post-traumatic arthritis for the left knee, though it previously assigned DC 5003, degenerative arthritis. The RO has continued to rate both knees pursuant to limitation of flexion pursuant to DC 5260.

Turning to the competent and probative evidence, the Board has reviewed the relevant medical evidence of record, including the Veteran's VA treatment records, x-ray imaging, private treatment records, and VA medical examination report. See 8/29/2023 CAPRI; see 9/23/2023 C&P Exam.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2023, reporting a sharp, grinding pain while walking and reduced range of motion that has worsened in severity over time. 9/23/2023 C&P Exam. The examiner confirmed a diagnosis of bilateral degenerative arthritis based on review of x-ray imaging studies. 9/23/2023 C&P Exam, pp. 3, 10. The Veteran reported that he has not had surgery for his conditions, is only able to perform certain activities, and experiences pain when sitting that requires him to alternate between sitting and standing. Id. at 4. The Veteran reported bilateral flareups of a moderate-to-severe nature that are precipitated by cold weather and extended sitting/standing, last 15-60 minutes, and which he treats with ice, Tylenol, and elevation of his legs. Id. 

The objective testing contained initial range of motion (ROM) measurements of normal right knee flexion and extension and left knee flexion limited to 130 degrees with normal extension. Id. at 6. The examiner noted pain on extension and flexion bilaterally. Id. Passive ROM measurements were the same as active ROM measurements bilaterally. Id. The examiner noted bilateral pain with weightbearing, active motion, passive motion, and a functional loss due to impaired ability to flex and extend the joint. Id. Repetitive use ROM did not result in any additional loss of function and no pain bilaterally. Id. at 7. Repeated use over time suggested pain causing functional loss with flexion limited to 135 degrees in the right knee, 125 degrees in the left knee, and normal extension bilaterally. Id. The Veteran's flareups resulted in limited functional ability due to pain and fatigability with estimated ROM measurements during flareups to be flexion limited to 135 degrees in the right knee and 125 degrees in the left knee with normal extension bilaterally. Id. at 8. 

The examiner indicated that there was no muscle atrophy, no ankylosis, no subluxation or persistent instability, and no patellar dislocation or tibial or fibular impairment in the left or right knee. Id. at 9-10. The Veteran did not have any meniscus (semilunar cartilage) conditions bilaterally and there is no surgical history indicated for either knee. Id. at 10. He did not have current treatment and did not take any medications. Id. at 4. The Veteran reported use of compression sleeves on a regular basis. Id. at 11. The examiner noted that September 2023 x-rays confirmed bilateral arthritis with no additional significant findings. Id. at 11. With respect to functional impact, the examiner noted that pain resulted in the Veteran's decreased ROM and interfered with the ability to bend, stoop, kneel, stand, or walk for prolonged periods, which the examiner further noted would impact the Veteran's ability to perform duties as a mailman. Id. The Board finds no reason to question the competency or credibility of the examiner and assigns substantial probative value to the examination report. 

With respect to the right knee, the Veteran is currently rated under DCs 5003-5260 at 10 percent pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, which allows for functional loss due to painful motion to be rated to at least the minimum compensable rating for a particular joint. Similarly, the Veteran is currently rated at 10 percent disabling for under DCs 5010-5260 for his left knee for functional loss due to painful motion pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. As discussed below, after a review of the competent and probative evidence of record, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted for either the right knee (DCs 5003-5260) or left knee (DCs 5010-5260).

During the entire period on appeal, the Veteran had, at worst, flexion limited to 135 degrees in the right knee and 125 degrees in the left knee. The next higher rating of 20 percent under DC 5260 is not more nearly approximated because the Veteran's flexion is not limited to 30 degrees. The Board acknowledges and is sympathetic to the Veteran's contentions that he experiences a grinding, sharp pain when walking and discomfort while standing and sitting. See 9/23/2023 C&P Exam. However, the weight of the evidence does not support a finding that the Veteran's disability picture due to functional loss/limitations or flare-ups is more nearly approximated by a higher rating. Moreover, considering the Deluca and Mitchell factors, and the evidence of record, the Board finds that the current 10 percent ratings already compensate the Veteran for any functional loss due to pain affecting the bilateral knees. Deluca, 8 Vet. App. at 204-07. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's pain and impacts to quality of life is contemplated and compensated by the current 10 percent ratings, as under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 the minimum compensable rating is to be assigned for the presence of pain only if there is no compensable limitation of motion in the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10. Accordingly, increased ratings in excess of 10 percent for the right knee (DCs 5003-5260) and left knee (DCs 5010-5260) are denied.

Because additional ratings under separate DCs, including 5256, 5257, 5258, 5259, 5261, 5262, and 5263 may be appropriate when none of the symptomology overlaps and the separate rating is based on additional disabling symptomology, the Board has considered whether separate ratings should be assigned for the Veteran's knee disabilities. See VAOPGCPREC 23-97, 62 Fed. Reg. 63, 603 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 9-98, 63 Fed. Reg. 56,703 (1998); VAOPGCPREC 9-2004 ; 69 Fed. Reg. 59, 988 (2004); Lyles, 29 Vet. at 107. VA's General Counsel (GC) has held that separate ratings may be warranted for limitation of flexion and extension when the criteria for compensable ratings are met for such limitation under DCs 5260 and 5261. VAOPGCPREC 9-2004 (Sept. 17, 2004). In that opinion, GC explained that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14,"[a]voidance of pyramiding," which provides that evaluation of the "same manifestation" under different diagnoses is to be avoided, did not preclude separate ratings for limitation of flexion and extension of the same knee joint, because such ratings are based on different symptomatology, i.e., a retrograde motion involving bending of the leg (limitation of flexion) and a forward motion to straighten the leg (limitation of extension). See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011) (holding that painful motion warrants the assignment of the minimum compensable rating for limitation of motion of the affected joint).

With these legal principles in mind, the Board grants a separate rating for painful limited extension under DC 5261 for both the right and left knees. In support, the competent evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has bilateral painful extension upon active and passive range of motion. See 9/23/2023 VA Examination, p. 6. Additionally, the Veteran experiences moderate-to-severe flareups with the right knee lasting 15-60 minutes. Id. at 4. Based on this competent medical evidence, the Board assigns an initial (minimum compensable) rating of 10 percent for limitation of extension for the bilateral knees over the entire rating period on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 ; Burton, 25 Vet. App. at 5 (holding that painful motion warrants the assignment of the minimum compensable rating for limitation of motion of the affected joint). The Board has considered whether the next higher rating more nearly approximates the Veteran's current level of severity. However, even when considering functional loss, the Veteran's limitation of extension does not more nearly approximate the next higher rating of 20 percent, which requires limitation of extension to 15 degrees. At the September 2023 exam, the Veteran was measured to have normal extension endpoint on active, passive, repetitive use, and repeated use over time, as well as during flareups. 9/23/2023 C&P Exam, pp. 6-8.

Separate ratings under DCs 5256 or 5257 are not appropriate because the evidence of record does not indicate that there is ankylosis, recurrent subluxation or instability, or any patellar instability in either knee. 

Ratings under DCs 5258 and 5259 are not warranted because the 2023 examiner noted that there was no indication of any meniscus (semilunar cartilage) condition. 

Finally, ratings under DCs 5262 and 5263 are also not warranted as the Veteran, per the September 2023 VA examination, does not have an impairment of the tibia and fibula or genu recurvatum. Id. at 10.

Furthermore, the Board finds that, although the September 2023 examiner opined that the Veteran's conditions would have an impact on his work, the issue of total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is not raised under Rice v. Shinseki due to the competent evidence of record that the Veteran works as a postman and did not report having missed work for any length of time due to his knee conditions. 22 Vet. App. 447, 454-55 (2009). Here, there is not cogent evidence of unemployability. See Comer v. Peake, 552 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (observing that evidence of functional impairment is insufficient to raise a TDIU where there is no evidence of unemployability).

After review of the competent and probative evidence of record, the Board finds that separate ratings for the Veteran's bilateral knee disabilities are warranted for painful extension and that higher ratings under DC 5260 and DC 5261 are not more nearly approximated by the Veteran's symptomology.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
