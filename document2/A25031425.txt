DOCKET NO. 240618-449168
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, and panic attacks, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, her acquired psychiatric disorder began during active service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.met.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1997 to April 2004.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran maintains that she has an acquired psychiatric disorder that began during or is otherwise related to her active duty service.  See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Claim for Compensation.

Service connection is granted for disabilities resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active duty or other qualifying military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  There are three requirements to establish service connection: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service; and (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The February 2024 rating decision on appeal favorably found a current diagnosis for major depressive disorder (MDD).  This finding is binding on the Board, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The Board finds no such error of record.

Additionally, the Board finds evidence that the Veteran was in treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, and panic attacks during the period on appeal.  See November 2021, July 2023, October 2021 VA treatment records.  The Board accordingly recharacterizes this claim as one encompassing service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, inclusive of MDD, GAD, panic disorder, and panic attacks.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  A current disability and in-service onset of that disability are accordingly established.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are generally absent complaints regarding anxiety, depression, or other psychiatric symptoms.  However, she later reported that her symptoms began during service, and she met with a therapist briefly in 2002, during active duty.  See September 2023 claim; January 2024 VA examination.  At the time, she had been charged with, and was subsequently cleared of, misconduct.  See, e.g., August 2002, October 2002 military personnel records.  The Veteran is competent to report what she has personally experienced and witnessed.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The personnel records supporting her statements enhance her credibility regarding those in-service experiences.  As such, the Board finds credible evidence of in-service symptom onset.  

Her post-service medical record shows treatment for anxiety, related in part to ongoing pain due to service-connected disabilities, since at least April 2018.  See, e.g., April 2016, April 2018, January 2020 VA treatment records.  Additionally, the January 2024 VA mental health examination found symptoms including depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks more than once weekly, near continuous panic or depression, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impaired judgement, disturbances in motivation and mood, and difficulty in establishing effective work relationships and adapting to stressful circumstances.  The VA examiner found no indication of psychiatric symptoms prior to service.  The examination repeatedly noted that the Veteran endorsed symptom onset in service.  The examination indicated ongoing relationship difficulties after service, including failed social relationships due to depression, anxiety, and lack of trust.  The Veteran reported that these behaviors have negatively affected her workplace relationships.  

Although the AOJ obtained this VA medical examination in response to the Veteran's claim, there is no accompanying VA medical opinion of record.  Generally, VA is required to assist a veteran in developing a claim for compensation, including providing a VA examination and medical opinion.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2), 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).  However, as the Board finds sufficient evidence to grant this claim in full, remand to obtain a medical opinion is not required.

The Veteran's initial claim and her January 2024 VA examination indicated that her psychiatric symptoms onset during service, related to her experiences in 2002, worsening since.  These statements are unrefuted on record.  Considering the record in aggregate, there is competent lay evidence associating objectively verified symptoms of the claimed disability to the Veteran's experiences in the military.  More specifically, there is unrefuted evidence of record showing the Veteran's current depression, anxiety, and difficulties making and maintaining relationships began with and are therefore related to her in-service experiences.  This evidence is entirely unrefuted on record.

There is accordingly sufficient, competent evidence in support of finding that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder is at least as likely as not related to her military service.  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996) (An "absolutely accurate" determination of etiology is not a condition precedent to granting service connection, nor is "definite" or "obvious" etiology).  Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include MDD, GAD, panic disorder, and panic attacks, is hereby GRANTED.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).
