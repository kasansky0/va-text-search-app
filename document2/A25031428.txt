DOCKET NO. 240523-443184
DATE: April 4, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for dermatographic urticaria is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1996 to December 2004.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

 In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for dermatographic urticaria disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Veteran is in receipt of a 10 percent disability rating for dermatographic urticaria under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7825, effective October 29, 2021. See April 2022 Rating Decision.

Effective Date

Unless specifically provided otherwise in Chapter 51 of Title 38 of the U.S. Code, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a).

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection is the date of separation from service if the claim is received within one year of separation; otherwise, the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2).

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (a). The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p).

Treatment records do not constitute informal claims when service connection has not yet been established for the condition. 38 C.F.R. § 3.157; Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244 (2002). While the VA should broadly interpret submissions from a Veteran, it is not required to conjure up claims not specifically raised. Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995).

?

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for dermatographic urticaria is remanded.

The Veteran contends, through his representative, that his effective date for dermatographic urticaria should be July 2018 or at least March 2020 because that was the date the Veteran indicated he wanted service connection for his urticaria issues. See May 2024 Notice of Disagreement.

In the Veteran's VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim filed on October 29, 2021, the Veteran submits his urticaria claim, stating "[his]skin reacts and swells and throbs when it is touched by anything. This happens to any part of [his] body, and it only started happening after [he] joined the military."

In an April 2018 Medical Treatment Record Non-government, the examiner noted a misdiagnosis of chicken pox on July 9, 2016, noting Veteran complaint of rash for three days. In the same record the provider noted the onset of the rash August 12, 2016, and gave the final diagnosis of spongiotic dermatitis and probability of pityriasis rosea.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's April 2018 VA 21-526b, Veteran Supplemental Claim where the Veteran stated he wanted to reopen his claim for skin condition over body.

In a June 23rd, 2018, CAPRI medical treatment record, the exam notes diagnosis of infectious skin conditions in 1996, and diagnosis of pityriasis rosea and pityriasis lichenoides in 2016. 

The Board acknowledges the July 2018 Notice of Disagreement where the Veteran requests an increase evaluation for pityriasis and a separate evaluation for pseudofolliculitis barbae. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's March 2020 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim application where the Veteran requested an increase rating for atopic dermatitis along with his submission of medical evidence supporting atopic dermatitis treatment and medication also noting the Veteran's complaint of a rash on his body that was causing pain in his joints and hand.

In an August 2020 VA Examination, the VA examiner noted the worsening of the Veteran's symptoms however there was no changes to the service-connected diagnosis and no additional diagnosis had been rendered. The same VA examination indicated that the Veteran's atopic dermatitis had been originally diagnosed as pityriasis lichenoides in error.

The Veteran contends that the current effective date assigned for his grant of service connection for dermatographic urticaria (October 29, 2021), is incorrect. The Veteran believes he is entitled to an earlier effective date but neither the Veteran nor his representative have provided any specific factual or legal argument as to why the Veteran should be awarded an earlier effective date on these issues. In short, the Veteran's rationale for asserting an earlier effective date for these service connection awards is unclear. However, a potential basis for an earlier effective date is the presence of symptomatology and treatment for his dermatographic urticaria disability during his post-service VA treatment and prior to October 2021.

In the November 2021 VA Medical examination, the VA examiner opined "Veteran's Dermatographism is a disease with a clear and specific etiology and diagnosis." This opinion is inadequate as the examiner failed to address or provide rationale regarding the presence of symptomatology and treatments. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). Furthermore, the examiner failed to address the above-reference service treatment records without full consideration of the Veteran's competent assertions that he has experienced continued dermatographic urticaria symptoms since service. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007).

In the April 2022 decision, an effective date of October 29, 2021, was given without obtaining an addendum to address the above-noted deficiency. The AOJ's reliance on this inadequate opinion is pre-decisional duty to assist error. A remand is necessary to correct it.

?

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the full symptomatology and treatment for the Veteran's service connected dermatographic urticaria.

In doing so, the clinician must specifically consider the following service treatment records and statements documenting symptoms or treatment for dermatographic urticaria: 1) April 2018 Medical Treatment Records Non-government; 2) June 23, 2018, CAPRI Medical Treatment Records; 3) March 9th, 2020, Medical Treatment Record; 4) August 2020 VA Examination.

Complete rationale must be provided for all opinions rendered.

The examiner is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions reached. The examiner is reminded that the term "as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility," but rather, that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher. Note that the lack of documented treatment in service, or a long period after, while probative, cannot serve as the sole basis for a negative finding. The Veteran's lay contentions must be considered and weighed in making the determination.
