REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1989 to August 2013, in the United States Army.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 higher level review rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The March 2024 decision was issued in response to the Veteran's request for higher level review of a November 2023 rating decision.

In May 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, electing the Direct Review docket. 

Given this procedural history, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision. See 38?C.F.R. ยง 20.301. If any evidence was submitted after the November 2023 rating decision, it was not considered. However, as the claim is being remanded, any such evidence will be considered by the RO on remand.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis

Service connection for allergic rhinitis was granted in an August 2015 rating decision with an initial noncompensable (zero percent) evaluation. In August 2023, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating. The November 2023 and March 2024 rating decisions on appeal continued the noncompensable evaluation. The Veteran contends that a compensable evaluation is warranted.

Upon review of the record on appeal, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error occurred and remand of the Veteran's claim is needed. See 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.802(a).

Prior to the November 2023 rating decision on appeal, a VA rhinitis examination was obtained in October 2023. The October 2023 examination report contains an inconsistency that was not resolved prior to adjudication of the Veteran's claim. 

Specifically, the examiner reported in Section III of the examination report that the Veteran had 1) rhinitis and 2) other pertinent physical findings or scars due to nose, throat, larynx or pharynx conditions. However, in Part F of the examination report, titled OTHER PERTINENT PHYSICAL FINDINGS, COMPLICATIONS, CONDITIONS, SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND SCARS, the examiner inconsistently reported that the Veteran does not have any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, symptoms, or scars.

Given that this inconsistency was not resolved, the Board finds that the October 2023 examination report was not adequate for adjudication. Accordingly, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error occurred and that remand is warranted in order to obtain an adequate examination. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (holding that when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate).

As the Veteran's claim cannot be granted under any raised theory of entitlement based on the current evidence of record, remand to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error is necessary. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a VA rhinitis examination.

2. Then, readjudicate the Veteran's claim for a higher rating for rhinitis.
