ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for right knee scars is denied.

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for painful right knee scar is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

There is no competent evidence that there is more than one painful right knee scar or that the symptoms have more nearly approximated three or four scars that are painful or unstable.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable rating for right knee scars other than the one painful scar have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7804

2. The criteria for a rating higher than 10 percent for painful right knee scar have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.118, DC 7804. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1986 to February 1990.  

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  In that decision, the AOJ, on higher level review, continued the noncompensable rating for right knee scars and 10 percent rating for a painful right knee scar after the Veteran filed a February 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review. Previously the AOJ issued a February 2022 rating decision that continued a noncompensable rating for right knee scars and granted service connection for painful right knee scar with an evaluation of 10 percent after the Veteran filed a December 2021 VA 21-526EZ.  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. In his April 2024 VA Form 10182 the Veteran appealed his claims for right knee scars and painful right knee scar.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As a final preliminary matter, the Board notes that after the Veteran filed his VA Form 20-0996 Request for higher level review, he filed a February 14, 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ indicating an increased rating evaluation for the right knee. In April 2023 the Veteran was provided with a VA examination. However, as noted above, the Board cannot consider this as this examination as it is outside of the  relevant appeal period.

1. Entitlement to a compensable rating for right knee scars is denied.

2. Entitlement to a rating, in excess of 10 percent, for right knee scar is denied.

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in VA's Rating Schedule.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.  If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation; otherwise, the lower evaluation will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  Where, as here, entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 510 (2007).  Here, as explained below, the uniform noncompensable rating for right knee scars that are neither painful nor unstable and a 10 percent rating for one painful right knee scar are each proper.

The Veteran's right knee scar is rated under 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.118, DC 7804. Scars are rated under Diagnostic Code 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805, or dermatitis (Diagnostic Code 7806), depending on the predominant disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7820.

Under the rating criteria (effective from August 13, 2018), the following criteria apply:

Diagnostic Code 7801, burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage and cover an area or areas of at least 6 square inches (39 sq. cm.), but less than 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.) warrants a 10 percent rating. 

Diagnostic Code 7802, for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, a 10 percent rating is assigned for an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.

Under Diagnostic Code 7804, one or two scars that are unstable or painful warrant a 10 percent evaluation. Three or four scars that are unstable or painful warrant a 20 percent evaluation. Five or more scars that are unable or painful warrant a 30 percent rating.

Note (1) for that code defines an unstable scar as one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of skin covering over the scar. 

Note (2) provides that if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. 

Note (3) provides that scars evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7804, when applicable.

Diagnostic Code 7805 provides that other scars are to be rated on limitation of function of the affected body part(s). 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

The Veteran filed his claim for an increased rating for right knee scars on December 29, 2021.  The appeal period therefore begins one year prior to this date, December 29, 2020.  

This case began with the December 15, 2021 claim, in which the Veteran sought an increased rating for his right knee scars.  At that time, the Veteran was in receipt of service connection for right knee scars associated with right knee arthritis status post arthroscopy with a noncompensable rating.  In February 2022, the RO determined that one of the Veteran's multiple scars was painful.  Rather than increasing the rating, the RO granted service connection for right knee scars (painful) and assigned a 10 percent rating and also continued the noncompensable rating for right knee scars.  The dispositive question in this appeal is therefore whether any of the right knee scars other than the one for which the Veteran is receiving a 10 percent rating are painful.  On the first page of the Addendum to the VA Form 10182, the Veteran's representative wrote, "Mr. Scott has consistently argued that all four of his knee scars are painful to the touch. Mr. Scott is competent to report his observable symptoms. Not only is a painful scar plainly observable to the person experiencing it, but Mr. Scott's observations are also the only way to know if they are painful. Therefore, it is unclear how an examination would contradict his assertions and state they are not painful."

The representative's general point that lay statements are competent to indicate painful scars is correct.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay witnesses are competent to testify as to their observations).  Whether a scar is painful is a matter about which a lay witness can competently testify.  In this case, however, the Veteran has never stated, either during the VA examination discussed below, or to the providers who created the VA and private treatment records, or in his written statements, that any of the scars other than the one painful scar for which he is receiving a 10 percent rating is painful.  Significantly, the Veteran's representative wrote in the above addendum, "Mr. Scott has consistently argued that all four of his knee scars are painful to the touch." (emphasis added).  Argument is not evidence.  See Ripley v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 21-0947, 2025 U.S. App. Vet Claims LEXIS 370, *64 (Mar. 24, 2025) ("attorney argument is not evidence") (citing Icon Health and Fitness, Inc. v. Strava, Inc., 849 F.3d 1034, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  The imprecise statement by the Veteran's representative does not indicate whether, and when, the Veteran stated that his other scars were painful.  Instead, it generally asserts that the Veteran argued the scars were painful.  As shown below, there is no statement by the Veteran or any health care professional that the other scars were painful. 

Specifically, the December 2021 VA examination VA examination report indicates that, based on examination and the Veteran's statements, there is one right knee vertical scar that is render to palpation.  The remaining scars were ot tender or painful.  The clinician indicated that the painful scar is 17 by 0.5 cm. Further, the clinician noted two scars that are not painful and are 1 by 0.5 cm. The clinician noted none of the scars are unstable or due to burn. The clinician reported the approximate total area of the Veteran's scars was 9.5 cm squared. The clinician reported, no scars or other disfigurements of the head, face, or neck were present. The clinician opined that there was a worsening of the Veteran's symptoms, however, there was no change to the service-connected diagnosis and no additional diagnoses were rendered during the examination.  There is no other indication in the VA or private treatment records that a clinician or the Veteran indicated that there was more than one painful scar.

As noted above, under DC 7804 a 20 percent rating requires three or four scars that are unstable or painful. The evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has one painful scar. However, he is already in receipt of a 10 percent rating based on having a painful scar. While the clinician in the December 2021 VA examination noted two additional scars, they were neither painful nor unstable. Moreover, under DC 7801 a 10 percent rating is warranted if scars are associated with underlying soft tissue damage and cover an area of at least 6 square inches (39 cm). Here, the Veteran's scars cover an area of 9.5 cm squared. Under DC 7802 a 10 percent rating is warranted if scars are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, a 10 percent rating is assigned for an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater. Again, as noted above, the Veteran's scars cover an area of 9.5 cm squared. Thus, the board finds the Veteran's current noncompensable rating for right knee scars and 10 percent rating for a painful right knee scar are proper.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether a compensable rating for right knee scars and a rating in excess of 10 percent for painful right knee scar is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for right knee scars and a rating in excess of 10 percent for painful right knee scar.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), 38 C.F.R. § 4.3, is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
