ORDER

The appeal of entitlement to service connection for hypertension from the May 2024 rating decision is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

This appeal stream represents an improper current appeal, as the matter was addressed by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in the January 2025 decision. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of entitlement to service connection for hypertension from the May 2024 rating decision have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Army from October 1975 to October 1979.

This matter comes to the Board on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, pursuant to the Board's January 2025 remand of entitlement to service connection for hypertension, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

For the reasons that follow, the Board finds this case is improperly before the Board and must be dismissed. 

The appeal of entitlement to service connection for hypertension from the May 2024 rating decision is dismissed.

The Veteran contends he suffers from hypertension due to his military service.

By way of history, this appeal stream originated from a May 2024 VA Form 10182, which appealed entitled to service connection for hypertension from a May 2024 rating decision. The May 2024 rating decision was issued in response to the Veteran's April 2024 Supplemental Claim, which requested further review of the AOJ's January 2023 rating decision.

Separately, the Veteran filed another VA Form 10182 in May 2023. There, the Veteran appealed a May 2023 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for hypertension. As such, the May 2024 rating decision was a spurious rating decision as the Veteran had sought concurrent election. In the original appeal stream, the Board remanded the matter back to the AOJ in a January 2025 Board decision.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c). 

The appeal beginning in May 2023 has a larger body of evidence (38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii)) and has the potential for an earlier effective date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). As such, that is the proper avenue for the Veteran to pursue his claim. This appeal is accordingly dismissed.
