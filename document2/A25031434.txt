REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection, to include on a secondary basis, for hypertension is remanded.

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for left knee strain (limitation of flexion) with arthritis and patellofemoral pain syndrome is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1997 to September 2011.  

The rating decision on appeal as to service connection for hypertension was issued in August 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the August 2022 rating decision.  In an October 2022 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) notified the Veteran that a duty to assist error existed which required further development.  After completing the necessary development, the AOJ reviewed the claim under the Supplemental Claim Lane and continued the prior denial of the Veteran's claim for service connection for hypertension in an October 2023 rating decision.  In his February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

As to the Veteran's claim for a compensable disability rating for left knee strain (limitation of flexion), a special review of the Veteran's file was mandated on May 5, 2020, resulting in an October 2023 rating decision that denied an increased rating for the Veteran's left knee strain (limitation of flexion).  In his February 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD, the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The issues of entitlement to service connection for hypertension and a compensable disability rating for left knee strain (limitation of flexion) are remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the October 2023 rating decisions on appeal.

Under current regulations, claimants are entitled to a "hearing on any issue involved in a claim before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim."  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1).  Moreover, notice is required for decisions made by VA affecting the payment of benefits or granting relief that includes notice of the right to a hearing.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(1).  Here, the AOJ did not provide the Veteran with notice of his right to a hearing under 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1) on the issues of entitlement to service connection for hypertension a compensable disability rating for left knee strain (limitation of flexion).  Therefore, a remand is required to correct this duty to assist error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the Veteran with proper notice of his right to a hearing under 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1) before the AOJ on the issues of entitlement to (1) service connection for hypertension and (2) a compensable disability rating for left knee strain (limitation of flexion) with arthritis and patellofemoral pain syndrome.

2. After the above development, readjudicate the claims on appeal, to include determining if the duty to assist requires any additional evidentiary development.
