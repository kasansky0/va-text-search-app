ORDER

The appeal of proposed actions to sever service connection for multiple scars, status post excision of skin cancer, scar on left shoulder, scars on left and right scapula, scars on upper chest and medial breast, and to reduce the assigned disability rating from 100 percent to 30 precent for multiple basal cell carcinomas, postoperative, upper and lower back, forehead, left temple, and nose (BCC disability) is dismissed.  

The appeal of issues for initial higher ratings for hypertension, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), gastroesophageal reflux disorder with diverticulitis (GERD disability), and anemia, and issues for service connection for Parkinson's like symptoms, peripheral neuropathy in the lower and upper extremities, and low back disability is dismissed.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a heart disability, to include paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a lung disability, to include granulomatous disease is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. An August 22, 2024, rating decision proposed to sever service connection for scars disabilities; this is not a final, appealable decision as to those matters. 

2. An October 22, 2024, rating decision proposed to reduce the assigned disability rating from 100 percent to 30 percent for BCC disability; this is not a final, appealable decision as to that matter. 

3. A November 20, 2024 VA Form 10182, notice of disagreement (NOD), was received more than one year after the date of mailings of the May 22, 2023 (denial of initial higher rating for hypertension), March 9, 2022 (denial of higher rating for anemia), February 3, 2022 (denial of initial higher rating for PTSD), and August 26, 2021 (denials of initial higher rating for GERD and service connection for Parkinson's like symptoms, peripheral neuropathy in the lower and upper extremities, and low back disability), agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions being appealed, and good cause has not been shown that would permit an extension of time for filing a VA Form 10182 as to each decision.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1961 to August 1966, November 1966 to February 1975, and July 1986 to February 1989 with additional Reserve service.

 The Veteran had service in the Republic of Vietnam in February 1967, and he has presumed exposure to herbicide agents, including Agent Orange. See VA Memo (December 2022) (conceding exposure to herbicides). VA also conceded his participation in Toxic Exposure Risk Activities (TERAs) from his military occupational specialty (MOS) as dental technician based on exposure to asbestos and x-rays and exposure to ship paints, oils, fumes, solvents, etc. See other (VA Memo) (January 2024); see also 38 U.S.C. §§ 1116, 1117, 1119, 1120; Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168 § 3373, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022). The Veteran has a combined rating of 100 percent and receives special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) from January 16, 2021. See Rating Decision - Codesheet (February 2025). 

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). The following rating decisions were issued under the AMA. 

A decision was issued on August 26, 2021, that awarded service connection for GERD disability and assigned an initial 10 percent rating, effective from June 16, 2021, and denied service connection for Parkinson's like symptoms, peripheral neuropathy in the upper and lower extremities, and a low back disability. 

A decision was issued on February 3, 2022, that award service connection for PTSD and assigned an initial 30 percent rating, effective from June 16, 2021.  

A decision was issued on February 21, 2022, that awarded service connection for anemia and assigned a noncompensable rating, effective from June 16, 2021; and after additional development, a March 9, 2022, rating decision continued the denial of an initial compensable rating for anemia.  

A decision was issued on May 22, 2023, that awarded service connection for hypertension and assigned a noncompensable rating, effective from August 10, 2022. 

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 22, 2023 decision denying service connection for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and granulomatous disease. A Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. On August 22, 2024, and October 22, 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decisions on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claims for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and granulomatous disease, respectively.  

Also, in the August 22, 2024, rating decision the AOJ proposed to sever service connection for multiple scars, status post excision of skin cancer, scar on left shoulder, scars on left and right scapula, scars on upper chest and medial breast, and proposed to reduce the assigned rating for BCC disability.  The October 22, 2024, rating decision continued the proposed reduced rating for BBC disability. 

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. 

As to the claims for service connection for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and granulomatous disease, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 22, 2024, and October 22, 2024 (liberally construed as decision on appeal for service connection for granulomatous disease), the supplemental rating decisions, respectively, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. The Board observes that additional evidence was submitted under 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. Thus, a waiver is not required regarding the option to change Board dockets under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding these claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

As explained below, each of the other issues on appeal is dismissed.

The Board has recharacterized the issues of service connection for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and granulomatous disease on appeal more broadly as claims for heart and lung disabilities in consideration of the lay and medical evidence of record. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 4-5 (2009). Although the Veteran did not explicitly appeal the denial of pulmonary fibrosis in the May 2023 rating decision, given the nature of his contentions and respiratory complaints in the August 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, it was included in his continuous pursuit of "granulomatous disease," now characterized as a lung disability. 

Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).

1. The propriety of proposed severance of service connection for multiple scars, status post excision of skin cancer, scar on left shoulder, scars on left and right scapula, scars on upper chest and medial breast.

2. The propriety of proposed rating reduction for BBC disability. 

The August 22, 2024, rating decision proposed to sever service connection for multiple scars, status post excision of skin cancer, scar on left shoulder, scars on left and right scapula, scars on upper chest and medial breast and proposed to reduce assigned rating from 100 percent to 30 percent for BCC disability. See Rating Decision (August 2024). The October 22, 2024, rating decision continued and confirmed the proposed rating reduction for BCC disability. See Rating Decision (October 2024). Neither the August 2024 nor October 2024 rating decision is not a final decision and is not appealable as to those issues. In this regard, both an August 2024 and October 2024 notification letters informed the Veteran that the decisions to for multiple scars, status post excision of skin cancer, scar on left shoulder, scars on left and right scapula, scars on upper chest and medial breast and to reduce assigned rating for BCC disability were proposed decisions only. See Notification Letter (August 2024); Notification Letter (October 2024). 

In response to the August 2024 proposed severance and the October 2024 proposed reduction and deferred determinations, the Veteran prematurely filed a VA Form 10182 with the Board and attempted to appeal the proposed severance of his service connected disabilities and proposed reduced rating for BBC disability. See VA Form 10182 (November 2024). However, as noted above, the August 2024 and October 2024 rating decisions were only non-final proposed severance and proposed rating reduction and deferred determinations, and they were not appealable decisions as to those matters. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.201; Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458 (2011) (concluding that a deferred rating decision does not constitute an appealable adjudicative action). Accordingly, the Veteran has not identified a specific determination with which he can appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d). Therefore, the appeal of these matters is dismissed.

The Board notes that in a February 2025 rating decision, the AOJ continued the 100 percent rating for BBC as well as continued service connection for multiple scars, status post excision of skin cancer, scar on left shoulder, scars on left and right scapula, scars on upper chest and medial breast; thus, the proposed rating reduction and severance of service connection were not effectuated. See Rating Decision (February 2025).

Timeliness of Board Appeal

VA regulations under the AMA require that a completed VA Form 10182 be received within one year from the date that the AOJ mailed the notice of the decision being appealed. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.203. The date of the mailing of the letter of notification of the decision is to be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b). This law is a mandatory claims-processing rule. See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (considering the same section in its pre-amended, "legacy" version); compare 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (b)(1)(A) (2000 & Supp. III 2004), with 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (b)(1)(A) (2024). When an application for review (i.e., an NOD) is not in conformity with the timeliness requirement, it shall not be entertained. 38 U.S.C. § 7108; see Id. 

An exception exists if a claimant establishes "an adequate excuse" for the NOD's untimeliness, such as an extension request with good cause, waiver, forfeiture, or any other relevant factor. Ferko, 37 Vet. App. at 269; see also Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).

3. Entitlement to initial higher ratings for hypertension, PTSD, GERD disability, and anemia. 

4. Entitlement to service connection for Parkinson's like symptoms, peripheral neuropathy in the bilateral upper and lower extremities, and a low back disability.

An August 26, 2021, AOJ rating decision awarded service connection for GERD disability and assigned an initial 10 percent rating, effective from June 16, 2021, and denied service connection for Parkinson's like symptoms, peripheral neuropathy in the upper and lower extremities, and a low back disability; a February 3, 2022, supplemental claim rating decision award service connection for PTSD and assigned an initial 30 percent rating, effective from June 16, 2021; a February 21, 2022, rating decision awarded service connection for anemia and assigned a noncompensable rating, effective from June 16, 2021 and a March 9, 2022, rating decision continued the denial of an initial compensable rating for anemia; and a May 22, 2023, rating decision awarded service connection for hypertension and assigned a noncompensable rating, effective from August 10, 2022. On November 20, 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, wherein the Veteran indicated that he sought review of the June 2021, February 2022, March 2022, and May 2023 rating decisions as to the denial of initial higher ratings and denial of service connection claims.

The Board concludes that, due to a claims processing rules defect, the issues of entitlement to initial higher ratings for hypertension, PTSD, GERD disability, and anemia, and entitlement to service connection for Parkinson's like symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, and low back disability are each dismissed. See Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 329.

Here, the November 2024 VA Form 10182 identified the August 2021, February 2022, March 2022, and May 2023 rating decisions; however, the VA Form 10182 was received more than one year from the date of the mailing of each letter of notification of those decisions, August 31, 2021, February 9, 2022, March 10, 2022, and May 24, 2023, respectively. The November 20, 2024, NOD underlying these matters therefore was not timely received, and they must be dismissed unless an adequate excuse is established. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A); Ferko, 37 Vet. App. at 269; Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 333-34.

The Veteran generally asserts "there is good cause for these issues" noting the number of VA notifications "apologizing, for delays and 'errors' in the Department of Veterans Affairs, to assist the claimant in the gathering of, and the presentation of evidence" and specifically identify a January 11, 2021, notification letter as an example. See Correspondence (November 2024). The Veteran also notes that since he already in receipt of 100 percent raring that was "little incentive for me to be greed, and appeal, appeal, and appeal" until the August 2024 rating decision proposing to reduce his VA compensation. See Correspondence (November 2024).

38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) provides that time limits within which claimants or beneficiaries are required to act to perfect a claim or challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended for good cause shown. Id. Where an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, the action required of the claimant or beneficiary must be taken concurrent with or prior to the filing of a request for extension of the time limit, and good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b). 

The Board finds that good cause has not been shown to extend the time to file the VA Form 10182 in this case. In this regard, the Veteran has not requested extensions of time for filing of timely NOD for the August 2021, February 2022, March 2022, or May 2023 rating decisions. Even assuming arguendo, his correspondence amounts to a time extension request, good cause has not been presented as to why the required action could not have been taken prior to the expiration of the time limit in June 2022, February 2023, March 2023, and May 2024, respectively, nor does the Veteran provide explanation for why the required action could not have been taken sooner than November 2024, which comes more than six months and up to over two years after the expiration of the respective time limits. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b). Here, the Veteran generally identified "delays" by VA in developing and adjudicating his claims, but those "delays" occurred prior the rating decisions he wishes appeal and his argument not support why he was unable to file timely NODs after each decision. Moreover, the Veteran, himself, reports being satisfied with his combined rating prior to August 2024 strongly suggesting he had knowledge of rating decisions and there was no obstacle to him filing timely NODs. See Correspondence (November 2024).

The record shows that the Veteran and his current representative were fully informed of their rights and obligations with respect to filing a timely VA Form 10182. Notably, each rating decision was properly mailed to the Veteran and his representative at that time, with accompanying instructions on the various avenues for disagreeing with the RO's determination, including via VA Form 10182. See Notification Letter (June 2021); Notification Letter (February 2022); Notification Letter (March 2022); Notification Letter (May 2023). As stated above, there is no evidence that these letters did not reach either party and the Veteran has not asserted otherwise. Thus, both the Veteran and his representative were afforded clear and meaningful instructions for submitting a timely VA Form 10182 to the referenced rating decision but failed to do so. On this basis, the November 2024 VA Form 10182 is untimely.

Furthermore, the mandatory claims-processing rule for a timely NOD has not been waived or forfeited. See Ferko, 37 Vet. App. at 262. To the extent that the Board sent a December 10, 2024, letter advising the Veteran that the Board "received your Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182) [and] your appeal has been placed on the Direct Review docket" - this is a ministerial letter and does not constitute waiver of enforcement of the mandatory claims-processing rule as it contains neither discussion of the facts nor applicable VA law and regulations concerning timeliness of the Veteran's NOD. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C) ("[a] question as to timeliness of the notice of disagreement shall by decided by the Board). Moreover, as this is the first opportunity that the Board has reviewed the Veteran's November 2024 NOD requesting that the Board review the decisions of the AOJ, so it could not have taken any action construable as forfeiting enforcement of the claims-processing rule.

Accordingly, the Board finds that, as proper claims processing rules have not been followed and there is no applicable exception to the filing of a timely NOD, the issues of entitlement to initial higher ratings for hypertension, PTSD, GERD disability, and anemia, and entitlement to service connection for Parkinson's like symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, and low back disability are each dismissed. 

Lastly, the Board finds that the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c) are not applicable. The regulation provides that notice and the opportunity to present evidence and argument, including the opportunity for a hearing, must be provided to all parties when the Board raises a question as to a "potential" jurisdictional defect. However, § 20.104(c) pertains to "jurisdictional authority" and not to "claims processing rules" defects. Nevertheless, even if § 20.104(c) was to apply, there is no question as to a "potential" jurisdictional defect, rather an actual and evident defect on the face of the record. See Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) (strict adherence to requirements of law is not warranted when adherence would result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the veteran).

Accordingly, the appeal of these issues is dismissed. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

In remanding this matter, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions.  Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a heart disability, to include paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a lung disability, to include residuals of granulomatous disease is remanded.

The Veteran asserts his current heart and lung disabilities each had an onset during his military service, and in the alternative, his current disabilities are a result of his presumed exposure to herbicide agents. See VA 21-526EZ (October 2022); VA Form 10182 (November 2024); Correspondence (November 2024). 

The Veteran asserts he first experienced irregular heartbeat during combat while station in the Republic of Vietnam, and in 1988, during his last period of service, he underwent cardiac evaluation for "fast and irregular heartbeat" and chest pain. See Buddy / Lay Statement (August 2023); Correspondence (November 2024). 

As to lung disability, the Veteran reports onset of shortness of breath during service as well as an in-service diagnosis of chronic granuloma based on radiologic evidence and as a result of "bout with some kind of a lung infection." See Buddy / Lay Statement (August 2023); Correspondence (November 2024). He also previously asserted that his current lung disability was a result of exposure to asbestos leading to "destructive lung changes." See Correspondence (August 1990); VA 21-4138 (November 1990)

The issues of entitlement to service connection are remanded to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the rating decisions on appeal.

First, the PACT Act created additional procedural rights for veterans who claimed TERA, one of which, is consideration of the records to determine participation in a TERA. 38 U.S.C. § 1119(a); see also VBA Letter 20-24-06 at 7, Updated Guidance on Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, (June 12, 2024). Here, while the record contains a VA memorandum concerning the Veteran's TERA participation, which was created after a review of the record along with an Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER) search that revealed no results, it appears incomplete. See other (VA Memo) (January 2024) (conceding TERA participation based on deployment-related presumed exposure to herbicide agents, MOS-related exposure to asbestos and x-rays, and exposure to ship paints, oils, fumes, solvents, etc.). Notably, the Veteran's STR also document his exposure to mercury, including laboratory results documenting mercury in his urine. See Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (May 1975) (May 1986 "mercury worker physical examination"; July 1986 mercury urine results 19.0 mg/L). Therefore, remand is necessary for the AOJ to prepare an updated TERA memorandum considering his exposure to mercury during service. 

Second, VA's duty to assist claimants includes obtaining records in the custody of a Federal department or agency, or if unavailable, informing the Veteran as to the unavailability of those Federally held records. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(1), (e). Here, the Veteran's STR are incomplete as there are no medical records from his first period of active service (May 1961 to August 1966) and the record contains "replacement" report of medical examination (RME) and medical history (RMH) dated in November 1971. See STR - Medical (April 2013). The AOJ also previously identified missing STRs concerning the Veteran's placement on temporary disability retirement list (TDRL) in February 1989. See Deferred Rating (September 1994). Additionally, the Veteran identified being treated for pneumonia on multiple occasions at military medical facility in Long Beach, including for "6-weeks" between 1973 and 1974, which are not of record. See Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (May 1975); Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (August 2005). The record reflects the AOJ's made additional requests to the Personal Information Exchange System (PIES) for a "complete set" of his STR and entire SPRs, and his SPRs were associated with the claims folder, but no additional STRs. See VA 21-3101 (August 2021); Medical Evaluation Board Proceedings, October 1974 Medical Board Report (October 2021); Military Personnel Record (November 2021). There is no record of a further attempt to obtain the missing STRs, nor has the AOJ issued a formal finding of unavailability as provided for in 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e)(1).

Third, a remand is necessary to obtain outstanding identified relevant treatment records in federal custody. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(1), (2); Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786, 793 (Fed. Cir. 2016).VA treatment records contain entries for scanned documents but a copy of those records was not associated with the claims file system. Specifically, VA treatment records contain entries for scanned documents from Cardiology Associates and Dr. Shuraih dated on February 28, 2024, electronically filed on March 26, 2024. See CAPRI (June 2024). As the Board does not have access to scanned documents associated with VA's electronic medical records system, a remand is necessary to associate copies of scanned records with the claims file.

Fourth, VA has a duty to assist claimants in relevant outstanding non-VA (private) treatment records identified by the record. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e)(2) (if VA becomes aware of the existence of relevant records before deciding a claim, VA will, among other things, request that the claimant provide a release for the records). Here, the Veteran submitted private medical treatment records indicating that he was hospitalized at Corpus Christi Medical Center in December 2023 for atrial fibrillation and he had follow-up appointments with his primary care physician, Dr. Alvarez, and his cardiologist, Dr. Turner at Coastal Cardiology.  See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (July 2024). A March 2023 private treatment record from Coastal Cardiology indicates further treatment from this provider. See Id. Additionally, VA treatment records show the Veteran was hospitalized at Doctors Regional for atrial fibrillation and continues to see his cardiologist, Dr. Turner. See CAPRI (June 2024). Despite this, none of those treatment records are of record nor is there any indication that VA has attempted to obtain these records although they appear relevant and were reasonably identified before the AOJ issued the decision on appeal.

Fifth, VA's duty to assist claimants in the development of their claims includes obtaining an examination and/or opinion when necessary to decide the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Further, once an examination or opinion is obtained, VA must ensure that it is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that it is adequate). 

As to heart disability, the January 2024 VA-obtained opinion concludes the Veteran's atrial fibrillation is less likely than not caused by his conceded TERAs, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran. See C&P Exam (January 2024). However, the rationale does not consider the Veteran's exposure to mercury documented in his STRs. Moreover, the VA-obtained opinion does not entertain the possibility that the Veteran's conceded TERA exposures is one of the causes, even if not the sole cause, of his atrial fibrillation. Instead, the VA-obtained opinion identifies risk for atrial fibrillation to include underlying heart disease, such as, heart failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), valvular heart disease, or hypertension, but the opinion does not identify which of these factors is applicable to the Veteran. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007).  Additionally, the VA-obtained opinion found no evidence that the Veteran had CAD or ischemic heart disease; however, a December 2022 private chest CT scan includes finding of "moderate three-vessel coronary atherosclerosis" even though the record lacks for confirmed diagnosis. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (January 2023); see also M 21-1, V.iii.11.2.d ("atherosclerosis" used interchangeably with arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease)). A medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993). 

Also, no VA opinion was obtained addressing the direct service connection theory for a heart disability, despite being was trigged to do so. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006) (the low threshold for indicating VA examination and/or opinion is warranted when there is an indication in the record that a current disability is related to military service). In this case, STRs show include complaints of chest pain and heart palpations in 1987, 1988, and 1989, along with abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) results in March 1987 and assessment of atypical chest in June 1987, but normal echocardiogram (ECHO) in July 1987 and normal EKG results in September 1987 and January 1989. See Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (May 1975). The Veteran asserts his current atrial fibrillation had an onset during his military service but no VA examination and/medical opinion was sought to address whether the Veteran has a current heart disability that was incurred in or related to his in-service complaints during his third period of military service.

Additionally, prior to the rating decision on appeal, the record raises the theory of secondary service connection for atrial fibrillation which should have been addressed by a VA medical opinion prior to the decision on appeal. See Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552-553 (2008). Here, the record contains medical literature identifying hypertension as a risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (July 2024); see also C&P Exam (January 2024). The Veteran is in receipt of service connection for hypertension. See Rating Decision (May 2023). A claim for secondary service connection requires medical evidence that connects the asserted secondary disability to the service-connected disability. Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998). Hence, VA's duty to obtain a medical opinion on secondary service connection was also triggered. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); see also McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 79.

As to lung disability, the October 2024 VA-obtained opinion concludes the Veteran's it is less likely than not caused by his conceded TERAs, because the Veteran did not have chronic granulomatous disease, which is an active condition characterized by repeated infections caused by bacterial and fungal pathogens. See C&P Exam (October 2024). Instead, the VA-obtained concluded that the Veteran had "old, calcified granulomas which are the remnants of previous infections" without further discussion on whether the Veteran had a current lung disability, and if so, whether it was incurred in or a result of his military service, to include participation in TERAs. Notably, the Veteran's STRS include treatment for bronchitis in May 1987, July 1987, and January 1989 as well as the Veteran's reported history of pneumonia 1972, 1973, 1974, 1989, a May 1987 STR chest x-ray report noting findings of calcified granuloma over right lateral lung base, and a June 1987 STR chest x-ray notes history of chronic granulomatous disease. See Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (May 1975). Additionally, a December 2022 private chest CT revealing calcified lymph nodes as sequela of previous infection and a March 2023 VA respiratory examination report shows current diagnoses of interstitial lung diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic granulomatous lung disease as well as the Veteran's reported history of shortness breath and treatment with prescribed inhaler and finding that the Veteran has multiple respiratory conditions but inability to determine which is responsible for pulmonary dysfunction. See C&P Exam (May 2023). The Board finds the VA-obtained medical opinion does not adequately address whether the Veteran has a current lung disability as related to his military service, to include conceded TERAs. See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991) (When the medical evidence of record is insufficient, the Board must supplement the record by seeking an advisory opinion or ordering a medical examination.)

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Contact the appropriate record repositories to request the STRs, and specifically, for his reports of medical examination and reports of medical history at separation. All attempts to obtain records should be documented in the claims file. If the requested records are unavailable and further attempts to obtain them would be futile, then issue a Formal Finding of Unavailability and notify the Veteran (and his representative) in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e).

2. After review of the record, and the Veteran's STRs showing exposure to mercury, create an updated TERA memorandum as deemed necessary. 

3. Obtain and separately associate with the claims file, the treatment records noted to be a scanned document for the following outside medical record from Cardiology Associates and Dr. Shuraih date February 28, 2024 (electronically filed on March 26, 2024). 

If these records are not located in the Veteran's VA treatment records for scanned documents, then the originating agency should prepare a Memorandum for the Record explaining so and notify the Veteran to afford her an opportunity to provide those records.

4. Ask the Veteran to complete VA Form 21-4142s from primary care physician, Dr. Alvarez, cardiology records from Dr. Turner and Coastal Cardiology, and records from Doctors Regional and Corpus Christi Medical Center. Make two requests for the authorized records from these providers, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

5. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for the claimed heart disability, to include paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  The examiner must review the claims file. The phrase "at least as likely as not" means the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal.

The clinician is asked to address the following: 

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's current heart disability, to include paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is etiologically related to his TERAs described as (1) exposure to herbicide agents while stationed in Republic of Vietnam in 1967, (2) exposure to asbestos, x-ray, and mercury based on his MOS as dental technician, and/or (3) exposure to ship paints, oils, fumes, solvents, etc. See other (VA Memo) (January 2024). Explain. 

Consider: (1) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and (2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran.

(b.) If his current heart disability, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is more likely than not due to or the result of another clear etiology, identify and fully explain.

(c.) Whether paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at least as likely as not that the Veteran's was incurred in or are related to the Veteran's complaints and findings as shown during his last period of service from July 1986 to February 1989. Explain.

Consider: (1) STRs noting complaints of chest pain and heart palpations in 1987, 1988, and 1989, along with abnormal EKG results in March 1987, in June 1987 assessment of atypical chest, normal ECHO in July 1987, normal EKG results in September 1987 and January 1989 (see Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (May 1975); (2) December 2022 chest CT scan showing evidence of "moderate three-vessel coronary atherosclerosis."; (3) VA treatment noting atrial fibrillation documented after COVID infection in August 2022; and (4) private treatment records showing diagnosis and treatment for atrial fibrillation.  

(d.) Whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's current heart disability, to include paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is (i) due to, or the result of service-connected hypertension; or (ii) aggravated, worsened beyond normal progression, by a service-connected hypertension. Explain.

Consider the medical literature references identifying hypertension as risk factor for development of atrial fibrillation. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (July 2024); see also C&P Exam (January 2024).  

6. Obtain addendum VA opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's lung disability. The phrase "at least as likely as not" means the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal.

Optional: The clinician may consider the Veteran's history as to onset and progression; and any documented history in formulating an opinion.

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's lung disability, to include interstitial lung diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, and granulomatous is etiologically related to his TERAs described as (1) exposure to herbicide agents while stationed in Republic of Vietnam in 1967, (2) exposure to asbestos, x-ray, and mercury based on his MOS as dental technician, and/or (3) exposure to ship paints, oils, fumes, solvents, etc. See other (VA Memo) (January 2024). Explain. 

Consider: (1) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and (2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran.

(b.) If his lung disability, to include interstitial lung diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, is more likely than not due to or the result of another clear etiology, identify and fully explain.

(c.) Whether the Veteran's current lung disability, to include interstitial lung diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, and granulomatous is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's was incurred in or result of documented respiratory illnesses noted during the Veteran's military service, including bronchitis and pneumonia. Explain.
