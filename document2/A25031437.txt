FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's service-connected allergic rhinitis did not manifest as or more closely approximate nasal polyps. 

2. The Veteran's service-connected shortness of breath disability did not manifest as, more nearly approximate, or closely relate to FEV-1 of 71- to 80-percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent, or; DLCO (SB) of 66- to 80-percent predicted.

3. The Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss manifested as no worse than Level I hearing acuity in each ear.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for allergic rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 3.400, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.14, 4.96, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6522. 

2. The criteria for a compensable disability rating for shortness of breath have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 3.400, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.14, 4.20, 4.96, 4.97, DCs 8866-6600.

3. The criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.385, 4.85, 4.86, 4.87, DC 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

Preliminary Matters

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1985 to February 1992.

The issues currently on appeal before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arose from multiple rating decisions.  The Board will summarize the relevant procedural history below.

The increased rating claim for allergic rhinitis has a long and complicated procedural history.  On September 24, 2022, the Veteran filed an Intent to File.  In February 2023 (within one year of the Intent to File), the Veteran filed a claim application, VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), for a respiratory disability (in pertinent part).  In a March 23, 2023 rating decision (with a March 24, 2023 notification letter), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted entitlement to service connection for rhinitis (claimed as a respiratory disability) on a presumptive basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 and assigned a 0 percent (noncompensable) disability rating from February 2, 2022.  

In an April 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found clear and unmistakable error in the March 23, 2023 rating decision's assignment of the February 2, 2022 effective date for the grant of service connection for rhinitis and assigned a new effective date of September 24, 2022.  

In April 2023, the Veteran timely requested Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the 0 percent (noncompensable) disability rating assigned for rhinitis in the March 2023 rating decision.  In an April 2023 HLR Return, the AOJ identified a duty to assist error, and then conducted additional development.  (While that development was pending, in May 2023, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, regarding the rating assigned for allergic rhinitis in the March 2023 rating decision.  However, that Supplemental Claim essentially was mooted by the fact that the AOJ already had decided to process this increased rating issue in the Supplemental Review Lane after finding a duty to assist error.)  

In a May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted a 10 percent disability rating for allergic rhinitis effective September 24, 2022.  (The May 2023 rating decision explained that although the Veteran had requested HLR in April 2023, the claim had been processed in the Supplemental Review Lane because after the identification of a duty to assist error.)  In April 2023, the Veteran timely requested HLR of the May 2023 rating decision.  In a February 2024 HLR rating decision, the AOJ continued the 10 percent rating for allergic rhinitis.  

In a March 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran timely appealed the February 2024 HLR rating decision's continuation of the 10 percent disability rating for allergic rhinitis and selected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, regarding this claim, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the prior, May 2023 rating decision (which was later subject to HLR).  38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

In summary, the increased rating claim for allergic rhinitis currently on appeal before the Board stems from the September 24, 2022 Intent to File a service connection claim for a respiratory disability, which the Veteran has continuously pursued by timely and properly filing requests for Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) administrative review options since the March 23, 2023 rating decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

Regarding the increased rating claim for shortness of breath, in a March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for this condition and assigned a 0 percent (noncompensable) rating effective November 20, 2022.  In the March 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran timely appealed the 0 percent disability rating assigned in the March 2024 rating decision and selected the Direct Review Docket.  Therefore, regarding this claim, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Regarding the increased rating claim for bilateral hearing loss, in a January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for bilateral hearing loss effective November 20, 2023 and assigned a 0 percent (noncompensable) rating.  In the March 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran timely appealed the 0 percent disability rating assigned in the January 2024 rating decision and selected the Direct Review Docket.  Therefore, regarding this claim, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Regarding the service connection claim for hypertension, in a March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied the claim.  In the March 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran timely appealed that decision and selected the Direct Review Docket.  Therefore, regarding this claim, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

In summary, the Veteran timely and validly appealed the following issues to the Board in the March 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement): entitlement to an increased rating for allergic rhinitis (February 2024 HLR rating decision); entitlement to an increased rating for shortness of breath (March 2024 rating decision); entitlement to an increased rating for bilateral hearing loss (January 2024 rating decision); and entitlement to service connection for hypertension (March 2024 rating decision).  

Regarding the claims decided herein, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  Regarding the remanded claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran also purported to appeal the following issues: entitlement to service connection for sinusitis (May 2014 rating decision); entitlement to service connection for sleep disturbances (May 2014 rating decision); entitlement to an increased rating for a stomach condition (May 2014 rating decision); and entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition clamed as stress (May 2014 rating decision).  However, those issues are not currently on appeal before the Board for the following reasons.

An April 2014 legacy rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for sinusitis, sleep disturbance, stomach condition, and an acquired psychiatric disability (claimed as stress). The Veteran was notified accordingly on May 6, 2014.  That notification letter also informed the Veteran of his right to appeal that rating decision and the procedures for doing so in the legacy system.  The Veteran did not file a Notice of Disagreement within one year of the May 2014 notification letter, and VA did not receive any new and material evidence within that appeal period.  Therefore, the April 2014 legacy rating decision became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.

The March 2024 VA Form 10182 was an invalid attempt to appeal such issues adjudicated in a legacy rating decision via the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system.  In August 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (als known as the AMA).  This law created a new framework for appellants dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review.  As explained in 38 C.F.R. § 19.2, the AMA became effective February 19, 2019.  Because the April 2014 rating decision predated the effective date of the AMA, the legacy (pre-AMA) appeal procedures applied.  As such, the Veteran's March 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), an AMA (rather than legacy) form for initiating an appeal, was an invalid attempt to appeal the issues adjudicated in the May 2014 legacy rating decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2(c).  

In summary, the issues of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis, sleep disturbance, a stomach condition, and an acquired psychiatric disability (claimed as stress) are not on appeal before the Board.  There is no indication that VA has waived or forfeited claims processing rules regarding these issues.  

Increased Rating Claims - General Principles

Disability ratings are determined by application of the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

"The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses is to be avoided...[T] the evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses are to be avoided."  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 (Avoidance of pyramiding).

"When an unlisted condition is encountered it will be permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous. Conjectural analogies will be avoided...."  38 C.F.R. § 4.20.  

When assigning a DC under 38 C.F.R. § 4.20 (rating by analogy), the listed disease or injury to which a veteran's unlisted condition is being rated by analogy must be only "closely related," not identical, to the unlisted condition.  The analogous rating criteria also need not be identical to the veteran's symptoms; rather, they must be examined by analogy, i.e., the functions affected, anatomical location, and symptomatology.  See Webb v. McDonough, 71 F.4th 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for allergic rhinitis is denied.

The Veteran claims entitlement to a higher rating for his service-connected allergic rhinitis, which is rated 10 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6522. 

Under DC 6522, a higher, 30 percent rating is warranted for allergic rhinitis with polyps.  This is the maximum schedular rating available under this DC.  

Turning to the evidence, during a February 2023 VA respiratory condition examination, the Veteran reported a history of clogged nasal passages and feeling congested.  The VA examiner did not indicate whether nasal polyps were present. 

A February 2023 private medical recorded regarding chronic disease management noted the diagnosis of "mild" allergic rhinitis.  However, on examination, the clinician found that rhinitis was not present.

During a May 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported symptoms and impairments such as a "stuffy nose" and difficulty breathing, especially while wearing a mask. The examiner found greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides due to rhinitis.  However, the examiner also found that there were no nasal polyps.   

In sum, the weight of the most probative evidence shows that the Veteran's service-connected rhinitis disability does not meet the 30 percent rating criteria based on the absence of nasal polyps.  

The Board considered the Veteran's contention that his allergic rhinitis disability is worse than reflected by the current 10 percent rating under DC 6522.  As a lay person, he is competent to report observable respiratory symptoms and impairments he experiences, such as nasal congestion.  However, he is not competent to identify a specific level of disability under the relevant rating criteria summarized above because such findings (e.g., the specific requirement of polyps) require specialized medical training, knowledge, and expertise.  Therefore, the Board affords such lay contentions minimal probative weight for rating purposes.

In summary, the evidence weighs persuasively against a disability higher rating than 10 percent for the service-connected allergic rhinitis and the appeal is denied.  Since the evidence is not at least in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply.  

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues; nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017).

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for shortness of breath is denied.

The Veteran's service-connected shortness of breath of unknown etiology has been rated 0 percent (noncompensable).  The AOJ rated this condition by analogy under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DCs 8866-6600 (chronic bronchitis) because this condition is not expressly listed in the rating schedule.   

Initially, the Board finds that the AOJ's use of DC 6600 is appropriate to rate the service-connected shortness of breath by analogy.  DC 6600 contemplates similar, closely related affected respiratory functions and symptoms.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20; see also Webb, 71 F.4th at 1380.

A higher rating is warranted under DC 6600 if the evidence shows the following:

"	FEV-1 of 71-80 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 71-80 percent; or DLCO (SB) 66-80 percent predicted (10 percent);

"	FEV-1 of 56- to 70-percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or DLCO (SB) 56 to 65 percent predicted (30 percent);

"	FEV-1 of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or; DLCO (SB) of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or; maximum oxygen consumption of 15 to 20 ml/kg/min (with cardiorespiratory limit) (60 percent)

The following special provisions apply for the application of evaluation criteria for DC 6600.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d).  

Generally, pulmonary function tests (PFT's) are required to evaluate the condition (subject to exceptions that do not apply here).  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(1).  

"If the DLCO (SB) (Diffusion Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide by the Single Breath Method) test is not of record, evaluate based on alternative criteria as long as the examiner states why the test would not be useful or valid in a particular case."  Id. § 4.96(d)(2).  

"When the PFT's are not consistent with clinical findings, evaluate based on the PFT's unless the examiner states why they are not a valid indication of respiratory functional impairment in a particular case."  Id. § 4.96(d)(3).

"Post-bronchodilator studies are required when PFT's are done for disability evaluation purposes except when the results of pre-bronchodilator pulmonary function tests are normal or when the examiner determines that post-bronchodilator studies should not be done and states why."  Id. § 4.96(d)(4).

"When evaluating based on PFT's, use post-bronchodilator results in applying the evaluation criteria in the rating schedule unless the post-bronchodilator results were poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results. In those cases, use the pre-bronchodilator values for rating purposes."  Id. § 4.96(d)(5).

"When there is a disparity between the results of different PFT's (FEV-1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second), FVC (Forced Vital Capacity), etc.), so that the level of evaluation would differ depending on which test result is used, use the test result that the examiner states most accurately reflects the level of disability."  Id. § 4.96(d)(6).

"If the FEV-1 and the FVC are both greater than 100 percent, do not assign a compensable evaluation based on a decreased FEV-1/FVC ratio."  Id. § 4.96(d)(7).

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran had a February 2023 VA respiratory condition examination.  The only noted diagnosis was chronic rhinitis.  The Veteran reported and the examiner noted various symptoms and impairments related to that specific, service-connected respiratory condition.  No PFT results were noted.  

A March 2023 private PFT report that was ordered as part of the Compensation & Pension (C&P) examination process.  The March 2023 PFT report revealed pre-bronchodilator results as follows: FEV-1 of 60 percent predicted, and FEV-1/FVC ratios ranging from 54 percent to 88 percent. Post-bronchodilator results were as follows: FEV-1 of 82 percent predicted, and FEV/FVC-1 ratios ranging from 86 percent to 87 percent.  DLCO results pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator were not noted.  The clinician advised, "Caution: Poor session quality.  Interpret with care[.]"  The clinician noted multiple PFT results with values that were outside of the normal range or significant post change. Session quality notes indicated that pre- and post-bronchodilator PFT results were not repeatable.  

The Veteran had another VA examination in May 2023, which focused on the Veteran's rhinitis.  The Veteran reported and the examiner noted various symptoms and impairments related to that specific, service-connected respiratory condition.  No PFT results were noted.

The Veteran had another VA examination in October 2023, which focused on the Veteran's rhinitis diagnosis.  The Veteran reported and the examiner noted various symptoms and impairments related to that specific, service-connected respiratory condition.  No PFT results were noted.

The Veteran had another VA respiratory condition examination in January 2024, which focused on the Veteran's sinusitis and rhinitis diagnoses.  The Veteran reported and the examiner noted various symptoms and impairments related to those specific, service-connected respiratory conditions.  No PFT results were noted.

The Veteran had another VA respiratory condition examination in March 2024.  (Although this VA examination report was uploaded into the electronic claims file in March 2024, the report itself indicates that the examination had been conducted in January 2024.  However, this January 2024 examination date appears to be incorrect because in the same report, the examiner cited February 2024 PFT results and a February 2024 chest x-ray report.  Also, a March 6, 2024 rating decision expressly deferred the shortness of breath compensation issue because an examination was needed.  Therefore, the Board refers to this document as the March 2024 VA respiratory condition examination report.) 

March 2024 VA respiratory examiner diagnosed shortness of breath of unknown etiology. The current symptoms were also described as shortness of breath.  The examiner noted February 2024 PFT results.  The February 2024 pre-bronchodilator PFT results were as follows (in pertinent part): FEV-1 of 109 percent predicted, and FEV-1/FVC of 86 percent.  Post-bronchodilator results were as follows: FEV-1 of 106 percent predicted, and FEV-1/FVC of 84 percent.  DLCO results were not noted. The examiner indicated that FEV-1 percent predicted was the PFT result that most accurately reflected the Veteran's level of disability (based on the condition being evaluated for this report).  The examiner noted that the Veteran's shortness of breath functionally impacted his ability to work because his endurance was low and he was unable to exert himself.

Private and VA treatment records did not reflect treatment for or complaints of shortness of breath during the appeal period.  A June 2023 private treatment record (regarding chronic disease management) noted wheezing and shortness of breath were not present, and on examination, breath sounds were normal.  A July 2023 private primary care noted "[g]ood air movement, chest expands symmetrically and no strider or stertor" on respiratory examination.  A November 2023 VA treatment record noted no shortness of breath with exertion.    

After a full review of the evidence of record summarized above, the Board finds that a compensable disability rating for the service-connected shortness of breath of unknown etiology is unwarranted.  The weight of the most probative evidence does not show that this disability manifested as, more nearly approximated, or closely related to FEV-1 of 71- to 80-percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent, or; DLCO (SB) 66- to 80-percent predicted (as required for the minimum compensable evaluation of 10 percent under DC 6600).  

The Board affords great probative weight to the February 2024 PFT results (noted in the March 2024 VA respiratory condition examination report), which contained competently reported findings addressing the relevant rating criteria.  Since the February 2024 post-bronchodilator results were poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results, the Board will consider the pre-bronchodilator results.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(5).  As noted above, the pre-bronchodilator February 2024 PFT results showed FEV-1 at 109 percent predicted and FEV-1/FVC of 86 percent.  These results fall well above the thresholds required for the minimum compensable 10 percent rating under DC 6600.  (Even considering the February 2024 post-bronchodilator PFT results for the sake of argument - FEV-1 of 106 percent predicted and FEV-1/FVC of 84 percent - the minimum compensable rating of 10 percent still would be unwarranted under DC 6600.)  

The March 2024 VA examiner indicated that the FEV-1 percent predicted PFT most accurately reflected the Veteran's level of disability.  However, in this case, any disparity between the results of different February 2024 PFTs would not change the level of evaluation (noncompensable) under DC 6600.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(6).

In contrast, the Board affords minimal probative value to the March 2023 PFT results because the clinician expressly indicated that the results were not reliable with a supporting medical rationale.  Specifically, the clinician advised, "Caution: Poor session quality.  Interpret with care[.]"  Session quality notes explained that pre- and post-bronchodilator PFT results were not repeatable.  

The Board considered the possible applicability of other DCs relating to the respiratory system, including whether rating by analogy under a different DC is warranted.  However, the Board finds that rating the service-connected shortness of breath disability by analogy under a DC other than DC 6600 lacks adequate support in the record.  The March 2024 VA respiratory condition examiner expressly found that the etiology of this condition was unknown.  There is no competent evidence of record suggesting that this disability more closely relates to another respiratory condition listed in the rating schedule, considering the relevant functions affected, anatomical location, and symptomatology.  See Webb, 71 F.4th at 1380.  The Veteran's reported symptoms, which primarily involve dyspnea (shortness of breath), are closely related to those experienced by individuals with chronic bronchitis.  Thus, the service-connected shortness of breath disability most closely relates to the respiratory symptoms and impairments contemplated by DC 6600.   

The Board considered the Veteran's general contention that his shortness of breath disability is worse than reflected by the current 0 percent (noncompensable) rating under DCs 8866-6600.  As a lay person, he is competent to report observable respiratory symptoms and impairments he experiences, such as shortness of breath with activity.  However, he is not competent to identify a specific level of disability under the relevant rating criteria summarized above because such findings (e.g., specific PFTs) require specialized medical training, knowledge, and expertise.  Therefore, the Board affords such lay contentions minimal probative weight for rating purposes.

Finally, the Board notes that the Veteran is in receipt of separate ratings for other service-connected respiratory disabilities: allergic rhinitis (10 percent from September 24, 2022, as discussed in the decision above); and chronic sinusitis (0 percent from November 21, 2023).  Any discrete respiratory symptoms and impairments due to those respective service-connected respiratory disabilities are contemplated by those ratings.  The Board cannot award higher ratings for the service-connected shortness of breath disability based on such separate respiratory symptoms, consistent with the rule against pyramiding.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

In summary, the evidence persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for the service-connected shortness of breath disability and the appeal is denied.  Since the evidence is not at least in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply.  

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues; nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette, 28 Vet. App. at 369-370.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran was assigned a 0 percent (noncompensable) disability rating for bilateral hearing loss.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, DC 6100.  He seeks a higher rating.

Disability ratings for hearing loss disability are based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of controlled speech discrimination testing together with the average hearing threshold level, in decibels (dB) as measured by pure tone audiometric tests in frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz (Hz). 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, DC 6100.

An examination for hearing impairment for VA purposes must include a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC). To evaluate the degree of disability from defective hearing, the rating schedule requires assignment of a Roman numeral designation, ranging from I to XI. Other than exceptional cases, VA arrives at the proper designation by mechanical application of Table VI, which determines the designation based on results of standard test parameters. Table VII is then applied to arrive at a rating based upon the respective Roman numeral designations for each ear.

Exceptional patterns of hearing impairment allow for assignment of the Roman numeral designation using Table VI or an alternate table, Table VIA, whichever is more beneficial to the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86. This applies to two patterns. In both patterns each ear will be evaluated separately.  The first pattern is where the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz) is 55 dB or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a). The second pattern is where the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hz and 70 dB or more at 2000 Hz. If the second pattern exists, the Roman numeral will be elevated to the next higher numeral.

Turning to the evidence, during a February 2023 VA audiological examination, the pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were reported as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	Average	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 23.75	 20	15	20	40

LEFT	21.25 	 20	10	15	40

Speech discrimination scores (using the Maryland CNC word list) were 98 percent in both ears.  The examiner found that the use of speech discrimination scores was appropriate bilaterally.  Applying Table VI, these results correspond to Roman numeral I for each ear.  Applying Table VII, this equates to a noncompensable, or 0 percent, disability rating. An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

July 2023 private medical records indicated that an audiogram had been conducted, which showed bilateral symmetric sensorineural hearing loss in an age-related pattern.  However, the records did not provide the audiometric test results.  (A December 2023 records request response from the provider indicated all available medical records had been provided. As such, additional requests for the referenced audiogram would be futile and no additional request is required. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(1).)

During a January 2024 VA audiological examination, the pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were reported as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	Average	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 30	20	25	30	45

LEFT	 33.75	30	25	35	45

Speech discrimination scores (using the Maryland CNC word list) were 98 percent in the right ear and 96 percent in the left ear.  The examiner found that the use of speech discrimination scores was appropriate bilaterally.  Applying Table VI, these results correspond to Roman numeral I for each ear.  Applying Table VII, this equates to a noncompensable, or 0 percent, disability rating. An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.  

The Board considered the Veteran's general contention that a higher (compensable) rating is warranted for his service-connected bilateral hearing loss.  As a lay person, he is competent to report observable audiological symptoms and impairments he experiences, such as difficulty hearing generally.  However, he is not competent to say that his hearing loss manifested as specific audiometric thresholds because this requires specialized testing by a qualified audiological professional.  The Board does not doubt the sincerity of the Veteran's lay statements.   However, VA disability ratings for hearing loss are derived from a mechanical application of the rating criteria to specific audiometric test results. Therefore, the Board affords such lay statements minimal probative value for rating purposes. 

In summary, the evidence persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for the service-connected hearing loss and the appeal is denied.  Since the evidence is not at least in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply.

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues; nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette, 28 Vet. App. at 369-370.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for hypertension. He primarily appears to contend that his hypertension is secondary to a psychiatric disability (phrased as stress).  See November 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ (Fully Developed Claim (Compensation)); see also March 2024 VA Form 10182.  Alternatively, he appears to contend that his hypertension is secondary to multiple unspecified conditions related to burn pit exposure during service.  See November 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ

This claim is remanded to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Specifically, remand is required for an addendum VA medical opinion.

At the time of the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran's only service-connected disabilities were bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and allergic rhinitis.  (Only the allergic rhinitis disability was service-connected based on exposure to fine particulate matter.  No psychiatric disability was service-connected at the time of this rating decision.)

The Veteran was afforded a February 2024 VA toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) opinion.  However, this negative TERA opinion was not responsive to the Veteran's secondary service connection theory, his main contention.  Specifically, although the examiner noted that various factors, including certain unspecified medical conditions, can contribute to the development of hypertension, the examiner failed to address whether the Veteran's specific service-connected disabilities, including rhinitis, caused or aggravated his hypertension. 

In summary, remand is required to cure this pre-decisional duty to assist error by obtaining another VA medical opinion.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Request a VA medical opinion from a qualified clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's hypertension. After reviewing the complete claims file, including this remand, the clinician is asked to address the following:

Is it at least as likely as not (evidence is at least in approximate balance, if not higher) that the Veteran's current hypertension was caused (due to) OR aggravated (worsened to any degree, even if non-permanently) by a service-connected disability?  

Please address both causation and aggravation.  

The examiner must provide a full rationale.  If the examiner cannot provide the requested opinion for any reason, please explain why.
