ORDER

An effective date of October 31, 2019, but no earlier, for the assignment of a 50 percent disability rating for atrophy of the left abdominis rectus, status post c-section, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has continuously pursued her claim involving entitlement to benefits for atrophy of the left abdominis rectus, status post c-section by timely filing a supplemental claim, a request for higher-level review, and a notice of disagreement.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence is at least in equipoise that her atrophy of the left abdominis rectus has been a severe disability since VA received her initial claim on October 31, 2019.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of October 31, 2019, but no earlier, for the assignment of a 50 percent disability rating for atrophy of the left abdominis rectus, status post c-section, have been met.   38 U.S.C. § 5108, 5110, 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2010 to May 2013.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2022 and constitutes an initial decision.  Therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), where she elected the Direct Review option.  Accordingly, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Effective Date

Generally, the assignment of an effective date for an increased disability rating for an already service-connected disability that is based on an original claim, or a claim for increase, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  However, the effective date may also be the earliest date as of which it is "factually ascertainable" that an increase in disability occurred if the claim is received within one year from the date of the increase, based on a review of the entire evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); see also Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997); Swanson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 442 (1999).  In determining whether an effective date assigned for an increased disability rating is correct or proper, the law requires (1) a determination of the date of the receipt of the claim for the increased rating as well as (2) a review of all the evidence of record to determine when an increase in disability was "ascertainable."  See Hazan, 10 Vet. App. at 521.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 29, 2020, for the assignment of a 50 percent disability rating for atrophy of the left abdominis rectus, status post c-section

The Veteran initially filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for atrophy of the left abdominis rectus on October 31, 2019.  In a July 2020 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for atrophy of the left abdominis rectus and assigned a 10 percent disability rating effective October 31, 2019.  

In November 2020, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension.  Subsequently, on December 29, 2020, VA received the Veteran's supplemental claim of entitlement to an increased disability rating for her service-connected atrophy of the left abdominis rectus.  In February 2021, the AOJ issued a rating decision, where it increased the disability rating assigned to the Veteran's atrophy of the left abdominis to 50 percent disabling effective December 29, 2020.

In May 2021, VA received the Veteran VA Form 20-0966 Request for Higher-Level Review, where the Veteran indicated that she sought an effective date of October 31, 2019, for the grant of a 50 percent disability rating for her atrophy of the left abdominis rectus.  

In November 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision continuing the 50 percent disability rating assigned to the Veteran's atrophy of the left abdominis rectus, but did not address the December 29, 2020, effective date for the grant of a 50 percent disability rating for her atrophy of the left abdominis rectus.  

In July 2023, VA received the Veteran's NOD, where she again contended that she was entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of a 50 percent disability rating for her service-connected atrophy of the left abdominis rectus.  In the NOD, she contended that the effective date for the grant of the 50 percent disability rating for her atrophy of the left abdominis rectus should be October 31, 2019, the date of her initial claim seeking service connection for that disability.  Specifically, she contended that October 31, 2019, was the proper effective date for the grant of a 50 percent disability rating for her atrophy of the left abdominis rectus because she had continuously pursued that claim since October 31, 2019.

As noted above, an effective date for a benefit will generally be the date of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Pursuant to the AMA, if a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date when the first claim was received in the continuously pursued chain, instead of the most recent request for review.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  Continuous pursuit may be accomplished by filing a timely supplemental claim, request for Higher Level Review, or an appeal to the Board. An initial claim for an increased rating on VA Form 21-526EZ cannot establish continuous pursuit, regardless of whether it was received within one year of the issuance of the prior VA decision.  Id. 

Here, the Veteran has successfully continuously pursued an increased rating for her service-connected atrophy of the left abdominis rectus via the December 2020 supplemental claim (specifically listing that she was appealing the 10 percent disability rating assigned to her atrophy of the left abdominis rectus in the January 2020 and July 2020 rating decisions issued in response to her original October 31,219 claim), via the May 2021 Request for Higher-Level Review (specifically listing the February 2021 rating decision that increased the disability rating assigned to her atrophy of the left abdominis rectus to 50 percent as the decision being appealed), and finally via the NOD.  Thus, the proper effective date for the 50 percent disability rating assigned to the Veteran's atrophy of the left abdominis rectus is the later of October 31, 2019, and the date entitlement arose.  

The Veteran's atrophy of the left abdominis rectus has been rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.73, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5319 (addressing muscle group XIX) throughout the appeal.  DC 5319 provides that a 50 percent disability rating is warranted for severe disability.  The ratings assigned under DC 5319 are determined based upon the criteria contained in § 4.56. 38 C.F.R. §4.73, Note (2). 

Muscle injuries are rated based partially on the nature of the injury, such as a gunshot wound, which was not present here.  In such cases, a "severe" muscle injuries is rated based on "cardinal signs and symptoms of muscle disability" that are worse than that shown for moderately severe muscle injuries, and, if present, evidence of inability to keep up with work requirements.  Objective findings include ragged, depressed, and adherent scars indicating wide damage to muscle groups in missile track; palpation shows loss of deep fascia or muscle substance, or soft flabby muscles in wound area; muscles swell and harden abnormally in contraction; and tests of strength, endurance, or coordinated movements compared with the corresponding muscles of the uninjured side indicate severe impairment of function.  If present, signs of severe muscle disability also include multiple scattered foreign bodies; adhesion of scar to the bone; diminished muscle excitability to pulsed electrical current in electrodiagnostic tests; visible or measurable atrophy; adaptive contraction of an opposing group of muscles.  38 C.F.R. § 4.56(d)(4).

In this case, the Board finds that the treatment records and the Veteran's statements confirm that the evidence is in relative equipoise that the Veteran's atrophy of the left abdominis rectus has been characterized as severe since the Veteran filed her claim on October 31, 2019.  For example, a June 2020 treatment record reflects that she had experienced severe pain for "several years" that interrupted her sleep and was exacerbated by walking.  The November 2019 Stomach and Duodenal Conditions VA examination report reflects that due to the disability, she was unable to pass the physical examinations required to be hired by law enforcement, could not run, and could not perform core exercises.  Moreover, the December 2019 Muscle Injuries VA examination report and her treatment records show loss of muscle substance and power in her left abdomen, impairment of muscle tone in her left abdomen, and visibile atrophy of the left abdomen.  Given these treatment records and the Veteran's competent and credible statements, the Board finds that the evidence is in relative equipoise that her atrophy of the left abdominis rectus has been a severe disability since at least the date of her original claim.  

By virtue of the foregoing, the Board finds that an effective date of October 31, 2019, but no earlier, is warranted for the grant of a 50 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected atrophy of the left abdominis rectus.  Additionally, because the Veteran has indicated that she sought and award of a 50 percent disability rating from October 31, 2019, and the Board has granted an effective date of October 31, 2019, for the assignment of a 50 percent disability rating for her atrophy of the left abdominis rectus, the Board will consider this to be a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal.  Cf. AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993).  The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided.  This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
