REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2014 to February 2018.  

The current appeal arises out of the Veteran's December 2021 claim seeking entitlement to service connection for the disabilities listed above.  In a March 2022 rating decision, the regional office denied service connection for all six disabilities.  Thereafter, the Veteran submitted a March 2023 request for?higher-level review?of the March 2022 rating decision.  The regional office in a June 2023 rating decision continued the denial of service connection for each of the six claimed conditions.  Most recently, the Veteran submitted a June 2024 notice of disagreement on VA Form 10182 and selected direct review of the evidence.  As such, the Board's review is restricted to that evidence that was of record at the time of the underlying March 2022 rating decision. To that end, the Board highlights that VA medical records have been added to the claims file that may not be considered by the Board in the present appeal as they are dated outside this evidentiary review period. 

Service Connection

Entitlement to service connection requires evidence of three elements: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran contends that he was exposed to excessive noise while in service which resulted in bilateral hearing loss.  As the Board finds that there is no objective medical evidence to support that the Veteran has a diagnosis of hearing loss in either ear, service connection must be denied for the condition. 38 U.S.C.   §§ 1110, 1131; McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); 38 C.F.R.               § 3.303 (a), (d).

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory threshold for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran was afforded a VA audiology examination in December 2021, with testing that revealed the following pure tone thresholds:

???? 	HERTZ???? 	???? 

 	500???? 	1000???? 	2000???? 	3000???? 	4000???? 

RIGHT???? 	10 	10?? 	10???? 	5???? 	5? 

LEFT???? 	10??? 	10???? 	10??? 	5???? 	10???? 

The average pure tone threshold result in the right ear was 8, and in the left ear it was 9.? Speech discrimination scores using the Maryland CNC word list was 98 percent in the right ear and 96 percent in the left ear.  The examiner declined to diagnose the Veteran with SNHL in either ear.

This examination represents the only audiometric testing available in the claims file for the period of time following the Veteran's discharge from service.  The Board also notes that VA medical records do not show any diagnosis of or treatment for a sensorineural hearing loss disability in either ear.

Based on the examination results and the lack of a diagnosis in the available medical records, the Veteran has not had a hearing loss disability in either ear at any point during the pendency of the appeal under VA standards pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The Board recognizes that the Veteran, as a lay person, is competent to describe the symptoms of bilateral hearing loss.  Layno?v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 469 (1994).  However, the audiometric results from the December 2021 VA examination, undisturbed as they are by any contrary medical evidence, have far more probative weight than the lay testimony as to the Veteran's hearing difficulty.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Lay persons such as the Veteran are not competent to provide the audiometric findings necessary for a finding of a hearing loss disability as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The fact remains that the post-service medical records do not contain a diagnosis of hearing loss in either ear for VA purposes pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Without a diagnosis by a medical professional, there is no valid claim of service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) for such disability.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3?Vet. App.?223, 225?(1992); 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b).  The claim is accordingly denied.

2. Service connection for sinusitis, rhinitis, tinnitus, IBS, and GERD is denied.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for sinusitis, rhinitis, tinnitus, IBS, and GERD as generally attributable to service on a direct basis.  Without delving into the question of the potential etiology of the claimed conditions, the Board finds that the Veteran has never been diagnosed with any of these five conditions, and there is no evidence to suggest that such diagnoses are appropriate; as such, entitlement to service connection must be denied for all five conditions. 

With regard to the claimed sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, IBS, and GERD, the Board highlights that available post-service medical records do not reflect that the Veteran has undergone any treatment for upper respiratory, gastroesophageal, and/or gastrointestinal symptomatology that may be associated with any of these four claimed conditions.  The Veteran has offered no lay testimony in favor of these   has provided no private medical records which would serve to illustrate that he has diagnosable sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, IBS, and/or GERD.  To that end, the Board must also acknowledge that the Veteran does not have the medical training or credentials to competently offer an opinion as to a diagnosis or its etiology. Jandreau v. Nicholson,?492 F.3d 1372?(Fed. Cir. 2007).? In short, there is no competent evidence in support of any of these claims.

As for the claimed tinnitus, the Board notes that the Veteran was afforded a VA audiology examination in December 2021, during which he answered in the negative to a query as to whether he experienced any symptoms of tinnitus.  The examiner also confirmed that the Veteran had no diagnosis of tinnitus in the available VA medical records.  Accordingly, the examiner declined to set forth a diagnosis of tinnitus, and further declined to opine as to the likely etiology of the claimed tinnitus.  

The Board's review of the record confirms the finding of the December 2021 examiner that there is no evidence in the available medical records of a diagnosis of tinnitus.  Moreover, the Veteran has offered no lay testimony in favor of the tinnitus claim, and indeed expressly denied experiencing symptoms of the condition during the same examination.  

Under these circumstances, the Board concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support a determination that the Veteran has sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, tinnitus, IBS, or GERD.  Although he has ostensibly asserted that he experiences these claimed conditions through the filing of the underlying claim, nevertheless, the objective medical evidence of record does not support a determination that he has a diagnosis corresponding to any of these five claimed disabilities.  Accordingly, service connection for?each of these five conditions?is denied.  Brammer, supra.
