ORDER

Entitlement to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 (Chapter 35) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A June 2019 rating decision granted the Veteran basic eligibility to DEA benefits based on a permanent and total service connected disability, effective April 1, 2017.

2. The Appellant, the Veteran's child, served on active duty from October 2021 to April 2022 and was discharged under other than honorable conditions for a "pattern of misconduct;" a discharge under other than honorable conditions is a bar to entitlement to Chapter 35 benefits.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to DEA benefits under Chapter 35 are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510, 351; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.12, 21.3021, 21.3040, 21.3042(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1990 to March 2017.  The Appellant is the Veteran's child, who also served on active duty from October 2021 to April 2022 and received a discharge "under other than honorable conditions."  See DD Form 214.  The Appellant appeals an October 2022 decision letter by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Buffalo Regional Office (RO) denying entitlement to Chapter 35 DEA benefits and requested the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) conduct a direct review of the evidence considered by the RO.  See May 2023 VA Form 10182.

Under the direct docket, the Board will consider the same record as that before the RO at the time of the October 2022 decision letter.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the October 2022 decision letter.  Id.  If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

For DEA benefits, basic eligibility can exist if a veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, and if he has a permanent and total service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021(p).

Here, a June 2019 rating decision awarded the Veteran basic eligibility for DEA benefits based on a permanent and total service-connected disability, effective April 1, 2017, the day after the Veteran separated from service.  This means, that all dependents of the Veteran are eligible for DEA benefits, including the current Appellant.

Importantly, however, when the child of the Veteran has served with the Armed Forces, his or her discharge or release from each period of service must have also been under conditions other than dishonorable.  38 C.F.R. § 21.3042(b) (emphasis added).  Pertinent to the Appellant, a discharge under other than honorable conditions is considered to have been issued under dishonorable conditions.  38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d)(4).

In October 2022, the Appellant applied for Chapter 35 DEA benefits.  See October 2022 VA Form 22-5490.  In October 2022, the Buffalo RO denied the Appellant's claim, finding that his discharge under other than honorable conditions precluded eligibility for Chapter 35 DEA benefits.  This appeal ensued.

The Appellant contends a mistake was made because his "twin brother with the exact same military record as [him] was approved" for Chapter 35 benefits.  See May 2023 VA Form 10182.  The Board does not have access to the Appellants brother's files, but such a finding is not relevant to this current appeal.  The Appellant's personal record reflects he was discharged under other than honorable conditions due to "a pattern of misconduct," which is a bar to Chapter 35 benefits.  See DD Form 214.  The Appellant makes no argument regarding the characterization of his service.

Service department findings (i.e., the Army, Navy and Air Force) are binding upon VA for purposes of establishing an individual's service.  VA does not have the authority to alter the findings of the service department.  38 C.F.R. § 3.203(a); see e.g., Spencer v. West, 13 Vet. App. 376, 380 (2000).  VA has no authority to alter the Appellant's discharge classification, and his proper recourse is with the service department.  Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416 (1994).

Nothing in the record indicates the service department upgraded the character of the Appellant's discharge, nor does he contend otherwise.  Further, the only defense to this regulatory bar to benefits is if the Appellant was insane at the time of committing the offenses causing discharge or release.  However, such a defense to this bar has not been raised by the Appellant or the record.  Where a fully developed record is presented to the Board with no evidentiary support for a particular theory of recovery, there is no reason for the Board to address or consider such a theory.  Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

As such, the Board finds the applicable law and regulations are clear, the Appellant's discharge under other than honorable condition for a pattern of misconduct is a regulatory bar to VA benefits as defined under 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d)(4).  As the law and not the evidence is dispositive in this case, the benefit-of-the-doubt provisions as set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) do not apply and the claim must be denied as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).  The Appellant's claim is denied.
