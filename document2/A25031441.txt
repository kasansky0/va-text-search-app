REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1943 to January 1946.  The Veteran died in December 1981.  The appellant is his surviving spouse.  

The decision on appeal was issued in September 2020.  In September 2021, the appellant filed a Supplemental Claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  In an October 2021 decision, the AOJ continued the denial.  In February 2020, the appellant opted into the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) review system by filing VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.  The appellant selected the "Hearing with a Veteran law Judge" lane.  This option also gave the appellant an opportunity to submit additional evidence in support of his appeal within 90 days after the hearing.  In December 2024, the appellant testified before a Veterans' Law Judge.  A transcript of the hearing is of record. 

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings made by VA.  In the 2021 rating decision, VA found that the Veteran had the minimum active-duty requirements to qualify for pension, he had wartime service, and his character of service meets the requirements to qualify for pension.

Entitlement to service connection for DIC, survivor's pension, and accrued benefits 

When a Veteran dies, his or her surviving spouse may be eligible to receive certain VA survivor benefits to include DIC and survivor pension benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1121, 1310, 1541; 38 C.F.R. § 3.50.

VA survivors' benefits may be paid to a surviving spouse who was married to the Veteran: (1) one year or more prior to the Veteran's death or (2) for any period of time, if a child was born of the marriage, or was born to them before the marriage.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1102, 1304, 1541; 38 C.F.R. § 3.54.  One claiming to be the spouse of a veteran has the burden to come forward with a preponderance of evidence of a valid marriage under the laws of the appropriate jurisdiction.  Aguilar v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 21, 23 (1991).

A "surviving spouse" is defined as a person whose marriage to the Veteran was valid under the law of the place where the parties resided at the time of the marriage, or the law of the place where the parties resided when the right to benefits accrued; and (1) who was the spouse of the Veteran at the time of the Veteran's death; (2) lived with the Veteran continuously from the date of marriage to the date of the Veteran's death except where there was a separation which was due to the misconduct of, or procured by, the Veteran without the fault of the spouse; and (3) has not remarried or has not since the death of the Veteran and after September 19, 1962, lived with another person of the opposite sex and held himself out or herself out openly to the public to be the spouse of such other person.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(j), 3.50.

Remarriage of a surviving spouse shall not bar the furnishing of benefits to such surviving spouse if the remarriage: (i) was void, or (ii) has been annulled by a court having basic authority to render annulment decrees, unless it is determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs that the annulment was obtained through fraud by either party or by collusion.  38 C.F.R. § 3.55(a)(1).

Further, remarriage of a surviving spouse on or after January 1, 1971, which was terminated prior to November 1, 1990, or terminated by legal proceedings commenced prior to November 1, 1990, by an individual who, but for the remarriage, would be considered the surviving spouse, shall not bar the furnishing of benefits to such surviving spouse provided that the marriage: (i) has been terminated by death; or (ii) has been dissolved by a court with basic authority to render divorce decrees unless the Department of Veterans Affairs determines that the divorce was secured through fraud by the surviving spouse or by collusion.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.55(a)(2).

A remarriage of a surviving spouse on or after October 1, 1998, terminated by death, divorce, or annulment, will not bar the furnishing of dependency and indemnity compensation, unless the Secretary determines that the divorce or annulment was secured through fraud or collusion.  38 C.F.R. § 3.55(a)(3).

On or after January 1, 2004, the remarriage of a surviving spouse after the age of 57 shall not bar DIC.  A surviving spouse who remarried after the age of 57, but before December 16, 2003, may be eligible for DIC provided the application for such benefits was received by the VA before December 16, 2004.  38 C.F.R. § 3.55(a)(10).

Analysis 

The appellant contends that she is entitled to DIC, survivors' pension, and accrued benefits.

The Veteran's death certificate shows that he died in December 1981.  In May 2019, the appellant submitted VA 21-534EZ, Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, Survivors Pension, and/or Accrued Benefits.  The appellant was born in December 1960.  She stated that she and the Veteran were married in July 1980, and the marriage ended in December 1981 when the Veteran died.  They did not have any children.  She reported remarrying since the Veteran's death.  Including her marriage to the Veteran, she was married a total of three times.  The appellant submitted a marriage certificate documenting her July 1980 marriage to the Veteran.  Additionally, the Veteran's death certificate shows that he and the appellant were married at the time of his death.  The appellant also submitted two marriage certificates and two divorce decrees.  One set of certificate and decree documents her August 1982 marriage to J.H., and their May 1988 divorce.  The other set documents her May 1993 marriage to R.D. and their November 2005 divorce.

Upon review, the appellant and the Veteran were validly married at the time of his death.  The question before the Board is whether the appellant meets the statutory definition of "surviving spouse" for VA purposes considering her subsequent remarriages.

During her December 2024 Board hearing, the appellant stated that she is entitled to pension benefits because she married the Veteran in July 1980, and they were married for a total of one year, two months, and two days.  They lived together as husband and wife until his death.  She stated after the Veteran's death, she remarried twice.  Her second marriage was in 1982, and her third marriage was in 1993.  At the time of the hearing, she was divorced.

Based on the facts of the case and the applicable laws and regulations, the Board concludes that the appellant does not qualify for recognition as the Veteran's surviving spouse for either DIC, accrued benefits, or survivors' pension benefits purposes.

Where a "surviving spouse" is defined by law as a person who has not remarried, the appellant's remarriage would generally bar her from eligibility for status as the Veteran's surviving spouse for DIC benefits.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.50(b)(2).  Under the general definition of a "surviving spouse," once the appellant remarried, she no longer had the status of the Veteran's surviving spouse for purposes of DIC benefits.  However, there are 10 exceptions to the general rule.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.55(a)(1)-(10); see also 38 U.S.C. §§ 103(d), 1311(e).  

First, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.55(a)(1), remarriage of a surviving spouse shall not bar the furnishing of benefits to such surviving spouse if the remarriage: (i) was void or (ii) has been annulled by a court having basic authority to render annulment decrees....  Here, the record does not show that the appellant's second and third marriages were deemed void or annulled by a court having basic authority to render annulment decrees.  Therefore, the exception under 38 C.F.R. § 3.55(a)(1) does not apply.

Second, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.55(a)(2), on or after January 1, 1971, remarriage of a surviving spouse terminated prior to November 1, 1990, or terminated by legal proceedings commenced prior to November 1, 1990, by an individual who, but for the remarriage, would be considered the surviving spouse, shall not bar the furnishing of benefits to such surviving spouse provided that the marriage: (i) has been terminated by death; or (ii) has been dissolved by a court with basic authority to render divorce decrees unless the Department of Veterans Affairs determines that the divorce was secured through fraud by the surviving spouse or by collusion.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.55(a)(2).  In this case, the appellant's marriage certificates document her 1982 and 1993 remarriages, i.e., these marriages occurred after the 1971 applicable date listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.55(a)(2).  The Board notes that the appellant's second marriage was terminated in May 1988.  Accordingly, as the appellant's second marriage was terminated prior to November 1, 1990, this exception applies.    

If the analysis stopped here, the appellant would be considered the surviving spouse for the purpose of establishing eligibility for VA survivors' benefits.

However, in May 1993, the appellant remarried a second time.  She remained married to her third husband until their November 2005 divorce.  Therefore, an exception must be met regarding the appellant's third marriage for the appellant to be considered the Veteran's surviving spouse for the purpose of establishing eligibility for VA survivors' benefits.  Here, the second exception does not apply because her third marriage was not terminated prior to November 1, 1990.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.55(a)(2).

Third, a remarriage of a surviving spouse on or after October 1, 1998, terminated by death, divorce, or annulment, will not bar the furnishing of dependency and indemnity compensation, unless the Secretary determines that the divorce or annulment was secured through fraud or collusion.  38 C.F.R. § 3.55(a)(3).  Here, the appellant's remarriage occurred prior to October 1, 1998.  Therefore, the exception under 38 C.F.R. § 3.55(a)(3) does not apply.

Exception four is not for application as there is not an application for benefits relating to medical care for survivors, educational assistance, or housing loans.  Exceptions five, six, seven, and eight are not for application as the appellant was in fact remarried, and there is nothing in the record to show that she was cohabitating with a person that was not her spouse.  Exceptions nine and 10 refer to remarriage of a surviving spouse after age 55 and 57, respectively.  As noted above, she remarried at age 22 and 33; therefore, exceptions nine and 10 are not applicable.

Therefore, the appellant does not meet the definition of "surviving spouse" for entitlement to survivor benefits.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.55.  

As such, the Board finds that by law, the appellant cannot be recognized as the Veteran's surviving spouse for the purpose of establishing eligibility for DIC, survivor's pension, and/or accrued benefits.  The positive and negative evidence are not in a state of approximate balance, so the benefit of the doubt cannot be given.  38 U.S.C. § 5017(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 778 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
