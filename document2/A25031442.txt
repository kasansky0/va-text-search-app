ORDER

Service connection for an eating disorder, claimed as obesity, is granted.

Service connection for hypertension is granted.

Service connection for a skin disorder, claimed as itching, is denied.

Service connection for erectile dysfunction as secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

REMANDED

Service connection for generalized anxiety disorder is remanded.

Service connection for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The competent and probative evidence shows the Veteran's eating disorder is proximately due to his service-connected PTSD.

2. The competent and probative evidence shows the Veteran's hypertension is proximately due to his obesity caused by his service-connected disabilities.

3. The competent and probative evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran had a current disability or functional impairment of earning capacity related to a skin disorder at the time of the claim or during the pendency of the claim.

4. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has erectile dysfunction.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for secondary service connection for an eating disorder are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310(a).

2. The criteria for secondary service connection for hypertension are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310(a).

3. The criteria for service connection for a skin disorder have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310(a).

4. The criteria for service connection for erectile dysfunction have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1988 to June 1995. 

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in March 2024 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

For the issue of service connection for generalized anxiety disorder, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Pursuant to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims holding in Clemmons, the Board has recharacterized the Veteran's claim for obesity, as a claim for an eating disorder. See Clemmons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. In order to establish entitlement to service connection, there must generally be 1) evidence of a current disability; 2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and 3) causal connection between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted for a disability, which is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either caused or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448-49 (1995).

VA's General Counsel (GC) issued a precedential opinion concerning service connection based on obesity. See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017 (Jan. 6, 2017). Precedent opinions issued by VA's chief legal officer are binding on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c). VAOPGCPREC 1-2017 concludes that obesity per se is not a disease or injury for purposes of 38 U.S.C. § 1110 and therefore service connection may not be established on a direct basis. Obesity is also not a disability for the purposes of secondary service connection per 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

While service connection cannot be established for obesity as a matter of law, where obesity resulting from a service-connected disease or injury is productive of an impairment beyond that contemplated by the applicable rating criteria, VA may consider an extra-schedular rating under § 3.321 for the service-connected disability based on impairment. Obesity may also act as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service-connected on a secondary basis per § 3.310.

VA may service connect the current disability on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) to include aggravation of a non-service-connected disability. See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 304, 306 (2020) (explaining service connection may be granted on a secondary basis where the claimed disability would not have occurred but for obesity caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability).

To determine whether obesity is an intermediate step between a service-connected disability and the development of a current disability that may be service connected on a secondary basis, the following criteria must all be satisfied: 1) the service-connected disability must have caused the Veteran to become obese; 2) the obesity, as a result of the service-connected disability must have been a substantial factor in causing the potential secondary disability; and 3) the potential secondary disability would not have occurred but for the obesity caused by the service-connected disability. 

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by her senses. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a). VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed Cir. 2009).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. Service connection for an eating disorder, claimed as obesity, is granted.

The Veteran contends that he has an eating disorder as secondary to his service and/or service-connected PTSD. The Board concludes that the Veteran has an eating disorder, and with resolution of reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the competent and probative evidence tends to show that the Veteran's eating disorder is secondary to his service-connected PTSD.

A November 2023 VA examination report show the Veteran has a current disability of unspecified eating disorder, and the November 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD with secondary other specified eating disorder. 

After review of the competent and probative evidence and resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the evidence shows that his service-connected PTSD caused his eating disorder. The VA opinion found that the Veteran's disordered eating is secondary to his service-connected PTSD. As such, the Board finds that the evidence shows that the Veteran's eating disorder is secondary to his service-connected PTSD. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Therefore, the Board finds that service connection for an eating disorder is warranted.

2. Service connection for hypertension is granted.

The Board concludes that the Veteran has hypertension, and when resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the competent and probative evidence tends to show that the Veteran's service-connected eating disorder caused him to become obese, which was a substantial factor in causing his hypertension. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

The November 2023 VA examination report shows the Veteran has a current disability of hypertension, and the November 2023 VA examiner opined that it is at least as likely as not proximately due to or the result of his obesity. In the November 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted the Veteran's obesity is due to his now service-connected eating disorder, as the examiner noted the Veteran has gained over 100 pounds. 

After review of the competent and probative evidence, the Board finds that when resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the evidence shows that his service-connected disabilities caused the Veteran's obesity, which was a substantial factor in the Veteran developing hypertension. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). The VA positive opinion found that a common cause and risk factor for hypertension is obesity. The record shows that the Veteran is obese. As such, the Board finds that the evidence shows that the Veteran's hypertension is secondary to his service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Therefore, the Board finds that service connection for hypertension is warranted.

3. Service connection for itching is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a skin disorder, manifested by itching, as secondary to his service-connected allergic rhinitis.

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted for a skin disorder.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary). The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), in Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393 (2020), defined a disability under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 as including any condition that results in a functional impairment of earning capacity. The requirement that there be a current disability is satisfied when the disability is shown at the time of the claim or during the pendency of the claim, even though the disability subsequently resolves. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). In the absence of proof of such disability there is no valid claim for service connection under any theory of entitlement. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The evidence of record fails to show a current diagnosis or functional impairment of earning capacity related to a skin disorder. In an August 2022 private treatment note, the Veteran complained of rash/itching disorder, however, no skin evaluation beyond the head and neck was conducted. Additional VA and private treatment records do not contain any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of a skin disorder at the time of the June 8, 2023, claim or during the pendency of the claim. In private treatment notes dated in January 2023 and September 2023, the Veteran denied hives and skin evaluations were normal. 

A March 2024 VA examiner also found no current skin condition. The Veteran reported itching in the lower legs but stated it did not impact his ability to perform occupational functioning and ordinary activities. The examiner's opinion is probative because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

The only evidence of record that conflicts with this finding are the Veteran's lay statements. However, while the Veteran may be competent to comment on observable symptoms, he is not competent to diagnose a medical disorder like a skin disability. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d. 1372 (2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In any event, his lay statements are outweighed by the medical evidence of record. The findings of the March 2024 VA examination are consistent with VA treatment records, which also do not document a skin disorder.

As there is not competent and probative evidence of a current skin disorder, the evidence is persuasively against the claim. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for a skin disorder is not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

4. Service connection for erectile dysfunction is denied.

The Veteran asserts service connection for erectile dysfunction is warranted as secondary to his service-connected PTSD. In his June 2023 claim, the Veteran stated that because his condition means his mind rarely give him a reprieve from anxiety, invasive thinking, and night terrors, his overall physical health has suffered. He is often unable to get and maintain a full erection necessary for penetrative sex. 

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted for erectile dysfunction as the evidence of record fails to show a current diagnosis or functional impairment of earning capacity related to erectile dysfunction. In an August 2022 private treatment note, the Veteran denied any sexual problems. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in March 2024. The examiner found the Veteran does not now have, or ever have had, a condition of the male reproductive system. The Veteran reported that his condition began in 2020 and that he has the inability to maintain an erection. After a physical examination, the examiner found there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis. The examiner noted the Veteran's erectile dysfunction condition is subjective. The examiner's opinion is probative because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

The only evidence of record that conflicts with this finding are the Veteran's lay statements. However, while the Veteran may be competent to comment on observable symptoms of the genitourinary system, he is not competent to diagnose an internal medical disorder like erectile dysfunction. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d. 1372 (2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In any event, his lay statements are outweighed by the medical evidence of record. The findings of the March 2024 VA examination are consistent with VA treatment records, which also do not document erectile dysfunction.

As there is not competent and probative evidence of a current diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, the evidence is persuasively against the claim. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for erectile dysfunction is not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for generalized anxiety disorder is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he has a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as secondary to his service and/or service-connected PTSD.

A March 2024 VA examiner noted there is no current diagnosis of GAD. The examiner referred to a past examiner who opined this condition was subsumed under PTSD and major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate with anxious distress. Therefore, a negative opinion remains appropriate as the claimed condition of GAD has not been diagnosed.

However, VA treatment records show a diagnosis of GAD as recently as January 2023. Furthermore, no VA examiner has specifically provided an opinion as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's GAD. The November 2023 VA examiner noted a diagnosis of major depressive disorder with anxious distress, but did not address the VA treatment providers assessment of a diagnosis of GAD. 

As it remains unclear whether the Veteran has a separately diagnosed GAD separate and distinct from his service-connected PTSD, a remand is necessary for an addendum opinion that addresses such.  

2. Service connection for ADHD and ASD is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that he has ASD related to service and ADHD secondary to service-connected PTSD. In his June 2023 claim, the Veteran asserted his ASD was worsened due to military service including recruit training, daily responsibilities, and stress. He reported before service he was often "the weird kid" and usually had to mask his thoughts and feelings to have any chance at meaningful relationships. He no longer masks his feelings or thoughts, so relationships are few and lasting ones are nonexistent. The Veteran also asserted his ADHD is secondary to his service-connected PTSD. He stated that because of the intrusive thoughts and night terrors, he is often unable to focus on tasks at hand or detailed instructions from his supervisors. He stated he becomes overwhelmed by the amount and scope of work he must do to catch up with the rest of the team. Focus has become a real problem, especially with regard to employment. 

The Veteran has current diagnoses of ADHD and ASD. 

Service treatment records (STRs) show no complaints, diagnosis, or treatment related to a current ADHD and/or ASD. An October 1994 treatment note indicated the Veteran was seen for anger control. He was found to have a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, unspecified and job-related stress. 

A July 2023 private assessment included diagnoses of ASD attention deficit disorder inattentive and hyperactive. The examiner also noted rule out PTSD. The examiner did not address the onset of the Veteran's ADHD and ASD, nor any relationship with service. 

A November 2023 VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's ASD disability is not at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. As there is a lack of sufficient evidence supporting autism in the military, it is less likely than not autism spectrum disorder was incurred in the military. 

Regarding secondary service connection, the November 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran's claimed ADHD is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected PTSD. The examiner noted that ADHD is a mental health condition involving problems with concentration and impulse control and not generally considered to be due to PTSD according to DSM 5 guidelines. 

The Board finds that this opinion is insufficient as the examiner failed to consider whether ADHD was incurred in service and whether the Veteran's disabilities were aggravated by PTSD. The Board notes the Veteran's contentions that ASD is  related to service and ADHD is secondary to service-connected PTSD. However, given that the Veteran is a lay person without medical knowledge, the Board finds that an examiner should have addressed such issues. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the etiology of the any current GAD, and address the following:  

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran has GAD that was incurred in, or is otherwise related to, his active service.

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran has GAD that was (a) due to or (b) aggravated by service-connected PTSD. 

If the examiner finds the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of GAD, the examiner should address the VA treatment records showing a diagnosis of GAD. 

The examiner is advised that aggravation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b) does not require that there be "permanent" worsening of the nonservice connected disability.

The examiner is also advised that 38 U.S.C. § 1110 allows for service connection of conditions that would have been less severe were it not for the service-connected disability even if the worsening of the condition occurs due to the natural progression of that condition. See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (2023).

The examiner must provide separate opinions and rationales to address secondary causation and secondary aggravation. Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74 (2018).

A complete rationale must be provided for all opinions rendered. 

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the nature and etiology of ADHD and ASD, and address the following:

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran's ADHD and/or ASD was (a) due to or (b) aggravated by service-connected PTSD

The examiner is advised that aggravation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b) does not require that there be "permanent" worsening of the nonservice connected disability.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
