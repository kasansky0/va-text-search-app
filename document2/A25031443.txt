ORDER

The claim for entitlement to a compensable disability evaluation for sinusitis has been withdrawn.

FINDING OF FACT

On November 29, 2023, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal of the claim for entitlement to a compensable evaluation for sinusitis, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through her attorney, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the claim for entitlement to a compensable evaluation for sinusitis by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This matter is on appeal from a May 27, 2022 higher-level review (HLR) rating decision.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) electing the direct review docket on June 7, 2022. 

On November 29, 2023, the Veteran notified the Board, through her attorney at that time, that she wished to withdraw the issue of entitlement to a compensable evaluation for sinusitis and identified the appeal as listed in this decision by its Notice of Disagreement date and issue.  See November 2023 VA Form 21-4138 (Statement).  The Veteran's attorney simultaneously withdrew as her representative.  November 2023 Third Party Correspondence.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
