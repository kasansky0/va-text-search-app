DOCKET NO. 211021-192820
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 8, 2017 for the award of service connection for acquired psychiatric disability, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Appellant submitted sufficient evidence to show that a VA Form 21-0996, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation, was submitted and received by VA on May 8, 2017.

2. The Veteran submitted a January 30, 2018 claim for service connection for acquired psychiatric disability within one year of the May 8, 2017 Intent to File.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of May 8, 2017 for the award of service connection for acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400, 3.402.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from March 1967 to March 1969. He passed away in June 2020 and the Appellant is his surviving spouse.

In May 2021 the Board granted service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, on the basis of substitution. A May 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD effective January 30, 2018. The Appellant submitted a July 2021 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, appealing the effective date of the award. 

The rating decision on appeal, which denied an earlier effective date, was issued in September 2021. The modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the October 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Appellant or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for acquired psychiatric disability

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award for pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

A submission of an application form prescribed by the Secretary, whether paper or electronic, must meet the requirements of a complete claim as set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160. A complete claim is required for all types of claims and will generally be considered filed as of the date it was received by VA for an evaluation or award of benefits under the laws administered by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d).

A claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. Id. 

An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). An intent to file a claim must identify the general benefit (e.g., compensation, pension) but need not identify the specific benefit claimed or any medical condition(s) on which the claim is based. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(2).

If within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a) appropriate to the benefit sought, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

To implement the "intent to file" provisions, VA created a new form, VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension Benefits (VA Form 21-0966). 79 Fed. Reg. at 57,664. As explained in VA's comments to the published final rule, this represents a standardized method of filing an informal claim which would be submitted in a format more amenable to efficient processing, while still allowing veterans to receive favorable effective date treatment similar to that available under the "informal claim" provisions. Id. at 57,665. It also achieves the standardization of the claims process by requiring that all claims or initiation of claims be filed on a VA-prescribed form. Id. 

The Appellant's representative contends that the Veteran submitted a May 8, 2017 Intent to File, prior to submitting his January 2018 application for compensation benefits, and that entitlement to service connection should be granted from the date of the Intent to File. 

The earliest document of record is the January 30, 2018 Application for Disability Compensation, identifying the Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. An Intent to File was not associated with the record prior to the date of the claim.

In July 2021, the Appellant's representative submitted a copy of a May 8, 2017 VA Form 21-0996, VA Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension. The Intent to File was signed by the Veteran on May 8, 2017. The representative asserted in an attached statement that the Intent to File had not been considered, and that their office had maintained copies of what was faxed to the VA Intake Center, along with the fax transmittal confirmation page that they received back. A May 8, 2017 Fax Coversheet shows that the Appointment of the Veteran's Service Organization as the Claimant's Representative and the Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension for the Veteran were both faxed to the BVA Claims and Evidence Intake Center on May 8, 2017, and the coversheet included a date and time stamp for the fax transmittal. An emailed Fax Confirmation Sheet shows that the fax had been successfully sent to the VARO. The May 8, 2017 Fax Confirmation Sheet included the same fax number identified in the cover sheet, as well as the Veteran's name as the identifier on the documents received by the VARO. 

The United States Court of Veterans Appeals (Court) has ruled that there is a "presumption of regularity" under which it is presumed that government officials have properly discharged their official duties. Clear evidence to the contrary is required to rebut this "presumption of regularity." Ashley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 307 (1992). The Court extended this presumption of regularity to procedures at the AOJ. Mindenhall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 271 (1994). Accordingly, there is a presumption of regularity of the AOJ's processes in receiving correspondence and associating such with the claims file, to include date-stamping upon receipt. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has found that a fax transmission receipt does not create a presumption of receipt. Riley & Ephraim Constr. Co. v. United States, 408 F.3d 1369, 1372-73 (2005). The Federal Circuit noted, however, in that same decision that "some courts have held that a fax confirmation sheet produces a rebuttable presumption of receipt." Id.  

Here, the Appellant and representative have submitted, not only the May 8, 2017 fax transmission cover page from their office showing that the Intent to File was sent for the Veteran, but also a Fax Confirmation Sheet for that same date showing that the fax with the Veteran's name as an identifier was received at the VARO. When considered with the representative's statement reporting their record keeping of the transmission of the Intent to File, the Board finds that the evidence is sufficient to rebut the presumption of soundness, and that the Intent to File, was submitted and received by VA on May 8, 2017.

The Board finds that the date of the claim in this case is set by the date of the May 8, 2017 Intent to File. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). The intent to file correctly identified the general benefit sought, which, in this case was a compensation benefit. The Veteran submitted a January 30, 2018 claim for service connection for acquired psychiatric disability within one year of the May 8, 2017 Intent to File. For these reasons, the Board finds that the earlier effective date of May 8, 2017 for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is warranted. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155(b), 3.400.
