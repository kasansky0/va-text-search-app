ORDER

The issue of whether a debt in the amount of $375.00 for books and supplies benefits under Chapter 33 of Title 38 of the United States Code (Chapter 33 or Post-9/11 GI Bill) was validly created, to include whether the debt should be waived, is REMANDED.  

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 2016 to December 2022.  The Veteran had additional service with the United States Army Reserve. 

The case is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC) decision that denied a waiver of indebtedness resulting from an overpayment of books and supplies benefits under Chapter 33 in the amount of $375.00. 

In the April 2023 Notice of Disagreement (NOD or VA Form 10182), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The March 2023 decision appeal addressed the issue of a waiver request.  However, in her April 2023 NOD, the Veteran challenged the validity of the debt by indicating that issues with depression and anxiety, which the Board construes as request for consideration of mitigating circumstances, interfered with the pursue of her program of education.  Every overpayment case potentially involves two other issues: (1) the validity of the debt; and (2) the amount of the debt.  The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that whether the underlying debt is valid or lawful is threshold determination that must be made prior to a decision on a request for waiver of the indebtedness. Schaper v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 430 (1991).  Accordingly, the issue has been added for consideration. 38 C.F.R. § 1.911(1).      

REASONS FOR REMAND

Whether an overpayment of books and supplies benefits under Chapter 33, in the amount of $375.00, was validly created and calculated, to include whether the debt should be waived

The first question for the Board prior to considering the Veteran's request for waiver is whether a debt in the amount of $375.00 for overpayment of books and supplies benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill were properly created. Schaper, 1 Vet. App. 430. 

A debt, or overpayment, is created when VA concludes that a monetary payment was made to a claimant in excess of what should have been paid. 38 U.S.C. § 3685.  Particular to this case, the overpayment of education benefits at issue involves payments under Chapter 33.  The specific statutory and regulatory provisions governing Chapter 33 benefits, to include payment and discontinuation, are found in 38 U.S.C. §§ 3301 to 3327 and 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.9500 to 21.9770. 

Here, the Veteran enrolled in a program of education at Houston Community College for the 2022 Fall term from August 22, 2022 to December 11, 2022. 

In an August 2022 enrollment certification (VA Form 22-1999), the school certified 12 distance credit hours.  The certification reflects 9 distance credit hours for courses running from August 22, 2022 to December 11, 2022, and 3 additional credit hours for a course running from August 22, 2022 to October 16, 2022.  

On September 30, 2022, the school filed an amended enrollment (VA From 22-1999b) reducing the Veteran's academic load by 3 credits for the course ending on October 16, 2022, and effective August 31, 2022.  The form indicates that the withdrawal occurred after the school's drop period and non-punitive grades were assigned.  The form's remarks section also notes mitigating circumstances as the reason for the reduction.  

Thereafter, on January 9, 2023, the school filed a second amended enrollment (VA From 22-1999b) reducing the Veteran's academic load by 9 credits for the courses ending on December 11, 2022, and effective October 17, 2022.  The form indicates that the withdrawal occurred after the school's drop period and non-punitive grades were assigned.  The form's remarks section again noted mitigating circumstances as the reason for the reduction.  

The above actions dropped the Veteran's academic load for the 2022 Fall term from 12 distance credit hours to 0 distance credit hours.  While the amended enrollments show that overpayment letters were produced, the record does not contain evidence demonstrating that the Veteran was notified of the overpayment nor how it was calculated.  

The record shows that an internal document titled Chapter 33, Deduction, Receivable and Balance Data was generated on January 18, 2023.  The AOJ noted a tuition and fees amount overpayment charged directly to the Houston Community College, and a books and supplies stipend overpayment in the amount of $375.00 for the entire 2022 Fall semester and charged directly to the Veteran.  Again, no notification letters are associated with the claims file as part of the generation of the overpayment.     

A Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655) was received on February 6, 2023.  An accounting audit conducted by COWC confirmed that the Veteran was enrolled for 12 distance credit hours for the 2022 Fall term and that she received a $375.00 payment in books and supplies benefits.          

In March 2023, COWC denied the waiver request on the basis that no records or supporting documents were supplied by claimant to show any Mitigating circumstances.

In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran asserts, in pertinent part, that she registered in school while still on active duty.  However, due to depression and anxiety from work, she was not able to balance, was overwhelmed, and decided to drop her classes to register once separated from service.   

38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(c)(1) provides that if an eligible individual, for reasons other than being called or ordered to active duty service, withdraws from all courses or, receives all nonpunitive grades and, in either case, there are no mitigating circumstances, VA will terminate educational assistance effective the first date of the term in which the withdrawal occurs or the first date of the term for which nonpunitive grades are assigned.  In this case, that date would correspond to August 22, 2022.  Nevertheless, if the eligible individual withdraws from all courses with mitigating circumstances or withdraws from all courses for which a punitive grade is or will be assigned, VA will terminate educational assistance for distance learning effective on the official date of change in status under the practices of the educational institution.  In this case, there is no evidence or guidance for the Board to conclude what would be that official date under the practices of Houston Community College.      

VA regulation provides that "in the first instance of a withdrawal from a course or courses for which the eligible individual received educational assistance, VA will consider mitigating circumstances to exist with respect to the withdrawal of a course or courses totaling no more than six semester hours or the equivalent." 38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(b).  If mitigating circumstances exist, VA will terminate or reduce educational assistance effective the end of the month during which the withdrawal occurred." Id.  Here, a review of the record shows that the Veteran first enrolled at Houston Community College in the 2022 Fall semester and that her reduction during the 2022 Fall semester may be her first instance of withdrawal for VA educational assistance benefits purposes.  Thus, 38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(b) is of potential applicability to the facts of this case.  Moreover, for any remaining debt, the AOJ appeared to have disregarded that mitigating circumstances existed at the time of the Veteran's withdrawal.  In that regard, the remarks section of both amended enrollments received in September 2022 and January 2023 for the 2022 Fall semester noted mitigating circumstances as the reason for the reduction.  Still, the record does not contain evidence showing that the AOJ assisted the Veteran, or conducted the necessary development, to obtaining the necessary information regarding those mitigating circumstances.  In the April 2023 NOD, the Veteran described such circumstances as mental health issues.

Under applicable law, mitigating circumstances means circumstances beyond the individual's control that prevent him or her from continuously pursuing a program of education. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9505. Examples of qualifying mitigating circumstances include: illness of the individual or a member of his or her family; family death; an unavoidable geographical transfer resulting from the individual's employment; an unavoidable change in the individual's conditions of employment; immediate family or financial obligations beyond the individual's control that require them to suspend pursuit of the program of education in order to obtain employment; discontinuance of the course by the school; unanticipated active duty for training; or unanticipated child-care difficulties. Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. § 21.7020.

The evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 COWC decision included medical records in support of ongoing mental health issues.  For instance, a March 2021 progress note shows that the Veteran had ongoing emotional outbreaks with having a lot of anxiety.  The Veteran endorsed having been crying easily and getting angry.  The Veteran relayed to her provider that there was some stress in her life but cannot explain why she was feeling that way.  The Veteran reported feeling tired all the time and without motivation.   A May 2022 record from Mason Park Medical Clinic lists moderately major depression disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and attention deficit disorder (ADD) as part of the Veteran's active health problems.     

After review of the record, the Board finds that the AOJ failed to conduct the necessary development or assist the Veteran in obtaining the necessary information in support of the mitigating circumstances listed in the September 2022 and January 2023 amended enrollments, which in turn could have reasonably aided the Veteran in substantiating her claim.  Also, the AOJ failed to consider whether the provisions set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(b) are applicable to the facts of this case.  This is particularly so as the Veteran has been made liable for the entire amount of the books and supplies payment in the amount of $375.00 without a notification explaining why adjustments were not made.  In other words, the Board cannot properly adjudicate the appeal as it is unclear whether the Veteran would owe less overpayment after consideration of the regulatory provisions discussed above.  

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a), the Board may remand a matter for correction of a pre-decisional error by the RO in fulfilling the duty to assist or any error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, no matter when made, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  

Decisions of the Board must be based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the decision on the issue or issues on appeal, and any additional evidence considered as part of the evidentiary record.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(d), 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).

In this case, the Board concludes that: First, the RO failed to satisfy a statutory duty by not properly notifying the Veteran on how the overpayment that is the subject of this appeal was calculated, and whether the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(b) we considered and, if so, why these were not applied.  Second, the RO failed to assist the Veteran in obtaining, prior to the issuance of the March 2023 decision on appeal, clarification as to the mitigating circumstances that resulted in her full withdrawal from Houston Community College, particularly when the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal contained medical records suggesting an ongoing mental health illness contemporaneous to the timeframe in question. 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.7020, 21.9505.  The Board finds that correction of these errors would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim and curing these errors will fulfill the AOJ's duty to assist.

Thus, for the reasons set forth above, the Board concludes that a remand is warranted to cure the errors.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.801(a), 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions: 

1. Associate with the claims file any overpayment notifications sent to the Veteran by the VA Regional office prior to the issuance of the March 2023 COWC decision.  If one does not exist, one must be provided, to include providing the Veteran an opportunity to submit evidence in support of the mitigating circumstances surrounding her withdrawal.   

2. Then, and upon consideration of the provisions set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(b), and (c), as applicable, readjudicate the Veteran's claim and provide notice to the Veteran of the same.
