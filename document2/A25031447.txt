ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for lumbar spinal stenosis (claimed as back problems) is denied. 

Entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for hypertension is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for ischemic heart disease is remanded.

Entitlement to an increased rating for prostate cancer is remanded.

Entitlement to total disability due to individual unemployability (TDIU) prior to June 25, 2013 is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's lumbar spine disability not secondary to service-connected peripheral artery disease and is not otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

2. For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's hypertension waws manifested by no more than diastolic pressure predominately 100 or more or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for lumbar spinal stenosis (claimed as back problems) to include as secondary to the Veteran's service connected peripheral artery disease are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

2. The criteria for a disability rating of 10 percent but no higher for service-connected hypertension beginning July 12, 2010, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1969 to April 1971. 

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the February 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. On January 17, 2023, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2021 SSOC as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request. 38 C.F.R. 20.301; 20.302(b). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to an increased rating for ischemic heart disease, entitlement to an increased rating for prostate cancer and entitlement to total disability due to individual unemployability (TDIU) any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that the AOJ requested the Veteran submit any relevant private treatment records or submit information with which VA can assist the Veteran in obtaining private treatment records.  Required notice and information were provided in the claim form which the Veteran signed, certifying to the fact that such notice was received and further than they have included or identified relevant evidence. VA requested records for which the Veteran submitted a proper release and/or adequately identified. The duty to assist is not a one-way street. If a Veteran desires help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining evidence. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991). Thus, the Board finds that VA has satisfied the duty to assist. No further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in development. Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).

The standard set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) only permits constructive receipt of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records that not only existed prior to the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal, but also for which the claimant furnished sufficient information to make the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) aware of the existence of those records. Thus, the Board's consideration of VHA records is limited to the same.  Here, the Board finds that VA treatment records were obtained and reviewed consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) and the AMA framework.

Service Connection

1. Entitlement to service connection for lumbar spinal stenosis (claimed as back problems).

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for a lumbar spine disability. In August 2011 the Veteran alleged that his back disability is secondary to peripheral artery disease. 

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For secondary service connection, it must be shown that the disability for which the claim is made is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury, or that service-connected disease or injury has aggravated (increased in severity) the nonservice-connected disability for which service connection is sought.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

Procedurally, the Veteran initially filed a claim for entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability in July 2010. The claim was denied in a March 2011 rating decision.  The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement in June 2011 and a statement of the case (SOC) was issued in March 2013.  The Veteran filed a VA form 9 in April 2013 and requested a Board hearing. A hearing was held in November 2014 (a copy of the transcript is associated with the claims file).  Thereafter, a March 2015 Board decision denied the Veteran's claim. The Veteran appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veteran's Claims (CAVC).  In November 2015 CAVC issued a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) indicating, in relevant part, that the Board failed to address whether the Veteran had a lumbar spine disability that is secondary to the Veteran's peripheral artery disease, to include as due to surgery for peripheral artery disease. A March 2016 Board decision remanded the Veteran's claim. A supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) was issued in February 2018 and the claim was remanded again in September 2018 for further development.  A new SSOC was issued in April 2020. The Board remanded the Veteran's claim again in July 2020 for further development and a new SSOC was issued in December 2020 and January 2021 (following additional evidence being added to the claims file). In February 2021 the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 and elected the hearing lane. The Veteran subsequently withdrew his hearing request in January 2023. 

Evidence of record including an August 2016 VA examination establishes that the Veteran has a current disability of lumbar stenosis. With respect to an in-service injury, during his November 2014 hearing and his August 2016 VA examination The Veteran denied an in-service injury, instead reporting that his back disability developed secondary to his service connected disabilities including his peripheral artery disease and an associated surgery. 

Absent an in-service injury, service connection cannot be established on a direct basis.  However, the Veteran may be entitled to service connection if the evidence shows that he has a service connected disability that caused or aggravated his lumbar spine disability.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2020. The examiner opined that the Veteran's lumbar stenosis is less likely than not incurred in or caused by military service and less likely than not caused or aggravated by the Veteran's peripheral vascular disease to include surgeries performed to treat his peripheral vascular disease.  As supporting rationale, the examiner noted that age, familial aggravation and body weight were the predominant predictors of degenerative disc disease. The examiner further noted that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability did not worsen following his surgery. 

The Board affords probative weight to this opinion as it is consistent with and supported by the evidence of the record. The record contains no evidence or opinion that the Veteran's lumbar spinal stenosis was caused or aggravated by his service connected disabilities. 

While the Veteran contends that his lumbar spine disability is due to his peripheral artery disease, the Veteran has not been shown to have the experience, training, or education necessary to give a probative etiology opinion on these claimed disabilities.  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, the Board finds that a lay person is not competent to provide a probative opinion as to the specific issues in this case in light of the education and training necessary to make a finding with regard to the complexities of the spine, to include as due to remote trauma and/or aging. See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011); see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Ultimately, the record shows no evidence of an in service injury to warrant service connection on a direct service basis. Additionally, the record shows no evidence that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability was caused or aggravated beyond its natural progression by his service connected peripheral artery disease. Accordingly, service connection is not warranted. 

Entitlement to service connection for lumbar spinal stenosis (claimed as back problems) is denied. 

INCREASED RATING

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  The percentage ratings represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  

Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Board will consider not only the criteria of the currently assigned diagnostic code, but also the criteria of other potentially applicable diagnostic codes.  

2. Entitlement to a compensable rating for hypertension prior to December 2020 and a rating in excess of 10 percent beginning December 22, 2020, and thereafter is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a compensable rating for hypertension prior to December 22, 2020, and a rating in excess of 10 percent thereafter. 

The Veteran initially filed a claim for entitlement to service connection for hypertension in July 2010. A March 2011 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim. The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement in July 2011 and a statement of the case (SOC) was issued in March 2013. The Veteran filed a VA Form 9 in April 2013. A March 2015 Board decision remanded the Veteran's claim for further development. Thereafter a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) was issued in August 2015. A March 2016 Board decision again remanded the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for hypertension. A new SSOC was issued in February 2018. A September 2018 Board decision remanded the claim for service connection for hypertension. An SSOC was issued in April 2020. Following additional evidence being received, a new SSOC was issued in May 2020. A September 2020 rating decision granted service connection for hypertension with a noncompensable rating effective July 12, 2010.  On October 19, 2020, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim, seeking a compensable rating for hypertension. A November 2020 rating decision continued the Veteran's noncompensable rating. The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 in February 2021 and elected the hearing lane. A June 2021 rating decision increased the Veteran's hypertension to a 10 percent rating effective December 22, 2020. In January 2023, the Veteran withdrew his hearing request. 

Hypertension is rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension).  Under DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. A rating of 40 percent is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more.  A rating of 60 percent is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more. 

Note 1 of diagnostic code 7101 notes that hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days.   For purposes of this section, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160mm. or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm.

Note 2 of diagnostic code 7101 notes that hypertension due to aortic insufficiency or hyperthyroidism, which is usually the isolated systolic type, should be evaluated as part of the condition causing it rather than by a separate evaluation.	

Note 3: of diagnostic code 7101 notes that hypertension should be evaluated separately from hypertensive heart disease.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria.  Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common."  See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

For the reasons that follow, the Veteran's hypertension has manifested in [diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control], corresponding to the criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 7101.

Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no obligation to discuss, in detail, the extensive evidence of record. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that the Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence).  Therefore, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as it relates to the Veteran's claim.

August 2020 VA treatment records note that for the period from July 21, 2020, to August 19, 2020, the Veteran had a high blood pressure of 144/78, low blood pressure of 117/66 and an average blood pressure of 131/73. September 2020 VA treatment records note that for the period from August 25, 2020, to September 23, 2020, notes a high blood pressure of 140/77 a low blood pressure of 120/61 and an average blood pressure of 128/69. December 2020 VA treatment records note that for the period from October 11, 2020, to November 9, 2020, the Veteran had a high blood pressure of 114/79 a low blood pressure of 115/64 and an average blood pressure of 127/69.  Subsequent December 2020 VA treatment records note that for the period from November 29, 2020, to December 25, 2020, the Veteran had a high blood pressure of 147/77 low blood pressure of 118/66 and average blood pressure of 130/72. 

January 2021 VA treatment records note that for the period from December 27, 2020, to January 25, 2021, the Veteran had a high blood pressure of 147'78 a low blood pressure of 115/67 and an average blood pressure of 128/72. February 2021 VA treatment records note that for the period from January 20, 2021, to February 17, 2021, the Veteran had a high blood pressure of 153/82 a low blood pressure of 115/65 and an average blood pressure of 129/73. 

Overall, during the period on appeal, the Veteran has not demonstrated diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more. However, the Board finds that the Veteran's requirement of continuous medication for control throughout the period on appeal suggests that his symptoms are analogous to the criteria for a 10 percent rating, but no higher under DC 7101.  

A higher 20 percent rating under DC 7101 is not warranted unless diastolic pressure is predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure is predominantly 200 or more.  Based on the evidence as discussed above, during the appeal period, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.  Accordingly, the Veteran's hypertension does not more nearly approximate the criteria corresponding to a 20 percent rating.  A higher 20 percent rating is not warranted. Similarly, there is no evidence of diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more to warrant a 40 percent rating and no evidence of diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more to warrant a 60 percent rating. Based on the evidence of record, a rating of 10 percent by no higher is warranted for the Veteran's hypertension.

Entitlement to a rating of 10 percent but no higher for hypertension beginning July 12, 2010, is granted. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to an increased rating for prostate cancer. 

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for ischemic heart disease to include on an extraschedular basis is remanded. 

4. Entitlement to total disability due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR THE REGIONAL OFFICE (RO) ADJUDICATOR:

This is a remand to cure pre-decisional duty to assist errors. 

(a)	The Veteran is seeking an increased rating for his service connected prostate cancer. November 2019 VA treatment records note that the Veteran's active medications include Tamsulosin HCl, which the Veteran is to take by mouth every evening for his prostate.  The Board must acknowledge and discuss the beneficial effects of medication used to treat the Veteran's disabilities. Here the record lacks sufficient information regarding the beneficial effects of the Veteran's medication, therefore remand is warranted for an addendum opinion regarding the effects of the Veteran's medication. 

(b)	The Veteran is seeking an increased rating for his service connected ischemic heart disease.  The Board must acknowledge and discuss the beneficial effects of medication used to treat the Veteran's disabilities. Here it is not clear from the record whether the Veteran is taking medication for his ischemic heart disease or that these medications are prescribed for his hypertension (as noted above); remand is warranted. 

(c)	The Veteran's claim for total disability due to individual unemployability is inextricably intertwined with the increased rating claims that the Board is remanding, therefore the claim must be remanded. 

THE REMAND DIRECTIVES FOLLOW. 

2. Obtain an opinion regarding the following from an appropriate examiner: 

(a)	Clearly indicate whether any medications (over the counter or prescription) the Veteran used affected the level of severity of his prostate disability as of the March 2021 VA examination. 

(b)	If any such medication was productive of ameliorative affects, clearly identify such effects and opine as to the severity of the Veteran's prostate cancer disability absent such medications as of the March 2021 VA examination. 

3. Obtain an opinion regarding the following from an appropriate examiner: 

(a)	Clearly indicate whether any medications (over the counter or prescription) the Veteran used affected the level of severity of his ischemic heart disease disability. 

(b)	If any such medication was productive of ameliorative affects, clearly identify such effects and opine as to the severity of the Veteran's ischemic heart disease disability absent such medications.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
