DOCKET NO. 210120-187797
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to payment or reimbursement for medical expenses for services rendered by the appellant to the Veteran on May 24, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The appellant's claim for payment or reimbursement of medical services was originally denied because the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) determined that the claim was filed past the 90-day timely filing deadline of 38 U.S.C. § 1725.

2. Upon secondary review, VHA overturned the initial denial decision after it was determined that the claim for payment or reimbursement for services rendered on May 24, 2020, was timely filed.

3. A VHA Letter, dated September 2, 2021, indicates that the claim seeking payment or reimbursement for services rendered by the appellant on May 24, 2020, would be paid by VHA.

4. As VHA has overturned its initial denial, there is no decision for appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for payment or reimbursement for medical expenses for services rendered by the appellant to the Veteran on May 24, 2020, are met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had honorable service in the United States Army from August 1979 to January 1983. This matter comes before the Board on appeal from an administrative decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) VHA.

In a January 2021 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Evidence Review docket under the modernized appeal review system (i.e., the AMA).

The appellant's claim for payment or reimbursement for medical services provided to the Veteran on May 24, 2020, was originally denied because the VHA determined that the claim was filed past the 90-day timely filing deadline of 38 U.S.C. § 1725. Upon secondary review, VHA overturned the initial denial decision after it was determined that the claim for payment or reimbursement for services rendered on May 24, 2020, was timely filed.

A VHA Letter, dated September 2, 2021, indicates that the claim seeking payment or reimbursement for services rendered by the appellant on May 24, 2020, would be paid by VHA. As VHA has overturned its initial denial, there is no decision to review on appeal that would grant the appellant greater benefits.
