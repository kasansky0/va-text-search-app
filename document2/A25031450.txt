DOCKET NO. 230207-321804
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for mental health disability, claimed as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is granted.

Service connection for polycythemia vera is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's mental health disability was caused by his service. 

Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, it is at least as likely as not that his polycythemia vera was due to his service.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for mental health disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

The criteria for service connection for polycythemia have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1972 to May 1976.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in October 2022 and November 2022 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In April 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for polycythemia vera most recently addressed in an October 2021 rating decision.  In November 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In July 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for a mental health disability most recently addressed in an October 2018 rating decision.  In October 2022, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the February 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. On November 5, 2024, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record related to polycythemia vera at the time of the November 2022 AOJ decision. Regarding the Veteran's claim for service connection for a mental health disability, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. The Board will also consider any evidence regarding either issue submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

This appeal is advanced on the docket on account of the Veteran's advanced age. 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2). 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c).

Based on the Veteran's claim for unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder and his previous claims for depression, anxiety, and PTSD, the Board has broadened the appeal to encompass all mental health disabilities, to include the claimed unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder pursuant to Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.  

Mental Health Disability

The Veteran contends his unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder is due to his service. Specifically, the Veteran stated he witnessed the body of a dead service member who had been overcome by jet fuel fumes. See August 2022 VA Examination. 

The Veteran's enlistment examination reports normal results. His service treatment record reports no treatment for or diagnosis of a mental health disability. 

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder.  Id. 

The key inquiry is whether his current disability is due to his service. 

An August 2022 VA examiner repeated the Veteran's contention of his in-service stressor and that he still had nightmares about the incident. The examiner also stated that the Veteran exhibited trauma related symptoms since service that had worsened since he stopped working. Although the examination report does not include a formal medical opinion, the examiner attributes the Veteran's current trauma related symptoms to his in-service stressor. The Board assigns substantial probative weight to the examiner's statements. 

The Board notes that the Veteran's conceded TERA along with his numerous service treatment records reporting unexplained symptoms support the private examiner's positive opinion. As there is a sufficient basis to grant service connection, further evidentiary development is unnecessary.  See Mariano v. Principi, 17?Vet. App.?305, 312 (2003). 

Accordingly, as the August 2022 examination report is the most probative medical evidence of record and relates the Veteran's mental health disability to his service, the Board resolves all doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that service connection for mental health disability is warranted.  38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.102; Gilbert, supra.  His appeal is granted.  

Polycythemia Vera

The Veteran contends his polycythemia vera is due to his service. Specifically, he contends his polycythemia vera was caused by his routine exposure to firefighting foam and jet fuel while in service. See April 2022 Statement in Support of Claim.

The Veteran's enlistment examination reports normal results.

A September 12, 1973 service treatment record reports the Veteran experienced headaches and dizziness. See November 2014 Service Treatment Record.

A September 23, 1973 service treatment record reports the Veteran experienced dizziness and headaches for 3 weeks.  Id. 

In an April 3, 1975 service treatment record the Veteran reported unexplained weight loss and headaches every day.  Id.

An April 14, 1975 service treatment record reports the Veteran experienced a loss of appetite.  Id. 

The Board notes that the Veteran served as an aircraft maintenance specialist and flight mechanic. See March 2017 Military Personnel Record. The Veteran stated he was exposed to firefighting foam and that he was exposed to, "aviation fuel from head to toe daily as well." See April 2022 Statement in Support of Claim. The Board finds the Veteran's statements regarding his exposure to firefighting foam and jet fuel competent and credible. The Veteran's toxic exposures are conceded. 

The Veteran is currently diagnosed with polycythemia vera.  See May 2019 VA Examination.

A September 2021 private examiner provided a positive nexus opinion stating, "[the Veteran] has polycythemia vera - hematological malignancy which causes excessive red cell production, and it is conceivable this disease could be caused by these chemicals since they seem to be broad-spectrum carcinogens." See September 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. The examiner's use of the word "conceivable" would normally render the opinion inadequate. See Bloom v. West,?12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999) (use of the term "could," without other rationale or supporting data, is too speculative to support award of benefits). However, the examiner also opined that firefighting foam has been linked to numerous similar diseases such as kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and prostate cancer, reinforcing the likelihood of a positive nexus.  This opinion reflects full consideration of all the pertinent evidence of record and includes an adequate rationale for the opinion rendered.

An August 2022 VA examiner provided a negative nexus opinion which cited the lack of service treatment records supporting in-service onset of polycythemia vera and that the Veteran was not diagnosed until 2015. The examiner did not address the Veteran's contended TERA. For these reasons, the opinion is inadequate. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (an examination was inadequate where the examiner did not comment on a Veteran's reports of in-service injury and instead relied on the absence of evidence in a Veteran's service treatment records to provide a negative opinion).

Accordingly, as the September 2021 opinion is the most probative medical evidence of record and relates the Veteran's polycythemia vera to his service, the Board resolves all doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that service connection for a polycythemia vera is warranted.  38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.102; Gilbert, supra.  His appeal is granted.
