ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder is dismissed as moot.

FINDING OF FACT

A December 2024 rating decision granted service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder, and there is no remaining case or controversy pertaining to the Veteran's claim for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1994 to February 2000.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), and denied entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder is dismissed as moot.

The Veteran appealed a January 2024 rating decision that denied service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder.

While the appeal was pending before the Board, the AOJ issued a December 2024 rating decision that granted service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder.

As the grant of service connection represents a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal, the Board finds there is no case or controversy pertaining to the Veteran's claim of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder. Accordingly, the appeal as to the issue presently before the Board is dismissed as moot. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997).
