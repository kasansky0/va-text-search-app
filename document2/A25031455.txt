DOCKET NO. 210407-150989
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of June 25, 2008, but no earlier, for a total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) based on the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, is granted.  

FINDING OF FACT

The claim for entitlement to a TDIU has been pursued since June 25, 2008.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of June 25, 2008, for the award of a TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.157, 3.340, 3.341, 3.400, 4.3, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from January 1969 to February 1977. 

This appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arose from an April 2020 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).   

In April 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), in which he elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal and evidence submitted within 90 days of the Veteran's VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board issued a decision granting an earlier effective date of September 30, 2013, for TDIU in April 2024. The Veteran then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). On appeal to the Court, the parties agreed to a joint motion for partial remand (JMPR) in October 2024. As noted in the JMPR, the Veteran did not challenge the portion of the April 2024 Board decision that granted entitlement to an earlier effective date.

 

Earlier Effective Dates

A total disability rating for compensation may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total and when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). If there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Id.

In determining whether a veteran can secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has directed that the Board give attention to: [T]he veteran's history, education, skill, and training; [W]hether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities (e.g., sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy) required by the occupation at issue. Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the veteran's limitations, if any, concerning lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, and reaching, as well as auditory and visual limitations; and [W]hether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue. Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the veteran's limitations, if any, concerning memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle workplace stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).

With respect to an earlier effective date, TDIU is a form of increased rating claim, and, therefore, the effective date rules for increased compensation apply.  See Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 420 (1999); Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000). The applicable effective date statutes and regulations provide that the proper effective date for increased rating claims is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim for increased rating.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of the claim for increase.  Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

Entitlement to an earlier effective for TDIU.

At the outset, the Board notes that in April 2024, the Board granted entitlement to an effective date of September 30, 2013, for TDIU.  See April 2024 BVA Decision. In issuing a JMPR, the parties agreed that the Board erred by not considering whether an effective date was warranted prior to the date assigned.  See October 2024 CAVC Decision. 

In finding that a JMPR was warranted, the parties noted that the June 2019 decision that initially granted entitlement to TDIU stemmed from "the confluence of two appeal streams: one from a May 2013 rating decision, and the other from a July 2014 rating decision."  See October 2024 CAVC Decision, p. 3. 

The Veteran has argued that an earlier effective date is warranted under the May 2013 appeal stream, as this appeal stream included the questions of entitlement to increased ratings for a cervical spine fracture and epididymitis.  See May 2013 Rating Decision - Narrative. Given that the May 2013 rating decision appeal stream is the only one in which an earlier effective date could be warranted, the Board focuses its analysis on that appeal stream. 

The Veteran contends that his claim for TDIU stems from a claim of an increased rating for residuals of a cervical spine fracture, as well as a claim of an increased rating for bilateral epididymitis with atrophy of the left testicle, both of which were part of the May 2013 rating decision appeal stream identified by the parties in the JMPR.  See December 2024 Appellate Brief. While both the Veteran's claims of increased ratings for residuals of a cervical spine fracture and epididymitis stem from the May 2013 rating decision appeal stream, each has a unique procedural history. Therefore, the Board will separately analyze the Veteran's claims of increased ratings for residuals of a cervical spine fracture and epididymitis as possible avenues for which an earlier effective date for TDIU could be granted. 

The Board begins by addressing the Veteran's cervical spine fracture claim. A claim for residuals of a cervical spine fracture was filed on September 18, 2012. This claim was denied by the AOJ in May 2013, along with entitlement to TDIU.  See May 2013 Rating Decision - Narrative. While the Veteran did not specifically appeal the denial for TDIU, he did pursue the underlying claim of entitlement to an increased rating for residuals of a cervical spine fracture. The Board notes that, when the Board granted entitlement to TDIU in June 2019, the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for residuals of a spine fracture had been found to have been continuously pursued, and the condition was considered in determining eligibility for TDIU benefits.  See June 2019 BVA Decision. Because the Veteran had made it clear that he was unable to work due, in part, to his cervical spine condition, it would ordinarily be possible to assign an effective date of September 18, 2012, for his TDIU.

However, the Veteran also contends that, based upon his epididymitis claim, the proper effective date for TDIU should be June 25, 2008. In this, the Board notes that an inferred claim was made on June 25, 2008. The AOJ provided a rating decision in April 2009 that denied entitlement to TDIU, and in July 2009 a rating decision denied entitlement to epididymitis. The Veteran appealed, and in August 2012 the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for epididymitis. Subsequently, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-8940 and sought entitlement to an increased rating for epididymitis in September 2012, which was adjudicated in May 2013 by the AOJ. As stated above, the May 2013 decision in turn was appealed and TDIU was granted. 

Therefore, the question before the Board is whether the claim of TDIU was raised as part and parcel of the increased rating claim for epididymitis. As established in Rice v. Shinseki, a claim for a TDIU can either be expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record when it involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability and is part of the claim for an increased rating.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009).

In this, the Veteran submitted VA Form 21-8940 in September 2012. There, he wrote that he could not work due to "back, headaches, all service-connected disabilities." The same form was again submitted in March 2019, which specifically included epididymitis in his description of what service-connected conditions caused his inability to work.  See March 2019 VA 21-8940. Therefore, the Board finds that TDIU was raised as part and parcel to the Veteran's claim of an increased rating for epididymitis. Accordingly, the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of June 25, 2008, as the date of claim, but no earlier, for the award of a TDIU.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). As such, entitlement to a TDIU based on the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, is granted effective June 25, 2008, but no earlier.
