ORDER

Service connection for a back disability is granted.

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, he has a back disability which is related to an injury that he incurred during his active duty for training (ADT).

2. Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, he has a current tinnitus disorder which had its onset during his active duty for training.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for back condition have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2010 to February 2011, with additional periods of active duty for training (ADT) and inactive duty for training (IDT) in the National Guard.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Qualifying Service

Active duty for training includes full-time duty with the Reserves, or the National Guard of any State under 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505, or the prior corresponding provisions of law. See 38 U.S.C. § 101(22)(b) and 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (22)(C); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (c). Essentially, this refers to the two weeks of annual training, which each Reservist or National Guardsman must perform each year. It can also refer to the Reservist's or National Guardsman's initial period of training.

Additionally, 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a) provides that any period of active military, naval, and air service, including active duty for training during which the individual was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, and any period of inactive duty training during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an injury (but not disease) incurred or aggravated in line of duty or from an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident, which occurred during such training.

To establish status as a "Veteran" for a period of active duty for training, a claimant must establish that he was disabled from disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during that period of active duty for training. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(a), (d); Paulson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 466, 470 (1995). The burden to establish "Veteran" status for a claim based on a period of active duty for training is on the appellant. Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167, 171-75 (2010). The fact that a claimant has established status as a Veteran for other periods of service does not obviate the need to establish that he is also a Veteran for purposes of the period of active duty for training where the claim for benefits is based on that period of active duty for training. Mercado-Martinez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 415, 419 (1998).

When a claim for service connection is based on a period of active duty for training, there must be some evidence that the appellant became disabled as a result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during the period of active duty for training. Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 47 (2010). In the absence of such evidence, the period of active duty for training would not qualify as "active military, naval, or air service," and the appellant would not qualify as a "Veteran" by virtue of active duty for training service alone. Id. See also 38 U.S.C. § 101(2), (24); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(d), 3.6(c).

Inactive duty for training includes service with the Reserve (other than full-time duty) that usually indicates weekend drills or training. 38 U.S.C. § 101(23)(A), 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(d). Inactive duty training also includes service in the National Guard of any State under 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505, or the prior corresponding provisions of law (including drill weekends under 32 U.S.C. § 502(a)). See 38 U.S.C. § 101(23); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (d).

When a claim for service connection is based on a period of inactive duty for training, there must be some evidence that the appellant became disabled as a result of an injury (not disease) incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during the period of inactive duty for training. Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 47 (2010). In the absence of such evidence, the period of inactive duty for training would not qualify as "active military, naval, or air service," and the appellant would not qualify as a "Veteran" by virtue of inactive duty for training service alone. Id. See also 38 U.S.C. § 101(2), (24); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(d), 3.6(d).

VA's Office of General Counsel has defined "injury" as harm resulting from an external trauma, while "disease" is defined as some type of internal infection or degenerative process. See VAOPGCPREC 04-2002.

1. Service connection for back injury

The Veteran seeks service connection for his back disability, asserting that an injury occurred during a period of active duty for training when he fell while carrying heavy equipment. See VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim dated March 2024.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

A March 2024 VA examination report reveals a current diagnosis of lumbosacral strain. Thus, the first Shedden element for service connection is met. 

As to the second element, in-service injury, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay statements that he injured his back while in training when lifting/carrying heavy weapons in addition to his already heavy gear. He reported that while at the 2012 annual training in Minnesota, he was training on how to operate while under enemy fire, when he fell onto his weapons and experienced back pain that was so severe that he could not move. His detailed account was corroborated by a buddy statement from a fellow servicemember, who witnessed the Veteran fall to the ground in severe pain while carrying weapons during the 2012 annual training. 

Reserve service treatment records show the Veteran had several back injuries beginning in 2012. In June 2012, the records show the Veteran had low back pain and he was suspended from activities until August 2012. He was cleared for duty without restrictions a few weeks later. 

The Veteran's service records indicate that during the period from August 2011 to August 2012, the Veteran had 53 days of inactive duty for training (IDT) and 21 days of ADT. The Board notes the Veteran's credible lay reports and the service treatment records regarding the onset of his back pain are consistent with an "injury" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. § 101. Therefore, the Board finds that there is sufficient evidence of record that the Veteran sustained an injury incurred during the period of active duty for training. 

With respect to the third element, the nexus, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2024. The Veteran reported that he has continued to experience back pain since his injury during training which has worsened over the years. The examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's back strain was caused by the in-service injury. The examiner stated the service records document lumbar region pain and there is evidence of chronicity, and a nexus is established. 

Accordingly, the Board finds the requirements are met for service connection for a back disability incurred while training for the National Guard. The claim for service connection for a back disability is therefore granted. 

2. Service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran states that he first began to experience tinnitus in 2012, gradually following noise exposure. He reported that he has constant high-pitched buzzing in both ears that has not changed since its onset. In a March 2024 statement, he reported that during annual training in 2012, he sustained a hearing injury while he was on the shooting range because he was not provided sufficient hearing protection. Further, he was exposed to loud noise from his fully automatic weapon system. He states that since that time, he experienced ringing in his ears. 

The Veteran is competent to report in-service noise exposure as well as the nature of his symptoms, their onset date, and their persistence since that date. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). In fact, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has specifically held that tinnitus is a type of disorder capable of lay observation and description. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002). Accordingly, the Board finds the Veteran's statement to be both credible and highly probative. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2024 VA examination. The examiner stated that there was no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds greater than normal variability from entrance to separation, and there was no evidence of permanent auditory damage while on active duty, nor any complaints of tinnitus in service. 

The Board acknowledges the negative nexus opinion provided in the February 2024 VA examination. However, the examiner did not acknowledge or address the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements regarding the onset and persistence of his tinnitus. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336, n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (stating that an examiner's opinion failed to consider whether lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of the Veteran's disability such that his claim could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence). The Board therefore affords the February 20024 VA opinion no probative value.

The Board finds that the evidence of record as to onset of tinnitus during active duty for training with continuity thereinafter is in relative equipoise. Therefore, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's current tinnitus was incurred in or caused by an injury during active duty for training.
