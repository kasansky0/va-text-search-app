FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's May 10, 1989, claim for service connection included an implied claim for tinnitus that was not addressed until September 12, 2023, rating decision.  

2. The effective date of service connection for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is May 10, 1989, as assigned in a September 1989 rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal that decision and it is now final.  In the absence of a timely appeal, consideration of this issue is legally precluded.

3. There are no unadjudicated formal or informal claims for service connection of a skin, scalp, or head disability prior to receipt of the July 25, 2023, claim.

4. There are no unadjudicated formal or informal claims for service connection of a heart disability prior to receipt of the July 25, 2023, claim.

5. There are no unadjudicated formal or informal claims for service connection for prostate cancer prior to receipt of the July 25, 2023, claim.

6. Erectile dysfunction is service connected secondary to prostate cancer, which has an effective date of July 25, 2023, and a secondary disability cannot have an effective date earlier than the primary disability.

7. There are no unadjudicated formal or informal claims for service connection for the right knee prior to receipt of the July 25, 2023, claim.

8. There are no unadjudicated formal or informal claims for service connection for the left knee prior to receipt of the July 25, 2023, claim.

9. The Veteran has the highest schedular rating available for tinnitus.

10. The Veteran's CAD manifests with breathlessness and fatigue with a workload of 5.1 to 7.0 METs, and cardiac hypertrophy has been diagnosed by echocardiogram.

11. The Veteran's right knee degenerative arthritis manifests with painful flexion functionally limited to 60 degrees. 

12. His right knee degenerative arthritis manifests with painful extension functionally limited to 10 degrees.   

13. The Veteran's left knee degenerative arthritis manifests with painful flexion functionally limited to 60 degrees.

14. His left knee degenerative arthritis manifests with painful extension functionally limited to 10 degrees.

15. The record does not reflect a basis for a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction.

16. The Veteran has a 100 percent (total) rating for the entire period on appeal, and there is no argument or evidence that unemployability is due to any single service-connected disability.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1964 to December 1986 and from January 1991 to September 1991.

This appeal is from September and November 2023 rating decisions.  The Veteran timely appealed to the Board and asked to be placed on the hearing docket.  He had a personal hearing in October 2024 with the undersigned VLJ.  

Under the regulations pertaining to the hearing docket, the evidentiary record closed for each issue on the date of notification of the decision, which will be discussed for each issue below.  The record reopened on the date of the hearing for 90-days for the Veteran to submit additional evidence in favor of his claim; the Board observes that evidence was received during this reopened window.  The Board's consideration of the evidence for each claim is restricted to the evidence that was of record on the date of notification of the decision on appeal and the evidence submitted by the Veteran during the reopened window.

EFFECTIVE DATES

In general, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of service connection, shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Under current regulations, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The term "application" or "claim" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1.

Prior to March 2015, an informal claim for service connection was acceptable to establish a service connection claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2008) (repealed 2015).  An informal claim included any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits.  The communication must identify the benefit sought.  Id.  

In order for a document to be recognized as an informal claim, "there must be a reasonable expectation for VA to act in the manner that the claimant intended." King v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 464, 470 (2010).  In determining whether an informal claim has been made, VA is not required to read the minds of the Veteran or his/her representative.  Cintron v. West, 13 Vet. App. 251, 259 (1999).  The Federal Circuit Court recently clarified that "identification [of the benefit sought] need not be explicit in the claim-stating documents but can also be found indirectly through examination of the evidence to which the documents themselves point when sympathetically read."  Shea v. Wilkie, 926 F.3d 1362, 1368 (2019).  The Court indicated that the adjudicator "must look beyond the four corners" of the claim in sympathetically determining what the claim-stating documents are seeking to obtain.  Id. at 1369.  However, the "mere presence of medical evidence" is not sufficient to indicate intent to apply for service connection or identify the benefit sought.  Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998).

1. An effective date of May 10, 1989, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus, is granted.

The Veteran's service-connected tinnitus has been assigned an effective date of July 25, 2023.  This is the date of receipt of his claim for service connection.  He has appealed for an earlier effective date.

Tinnitus was granted service connection in a September 2023 rating decision that had a notification date of September 14, 2023.  The record closed on this date, but reopened for 90 days on October 16, 2024, the date of his personal hearing.  The Board's consideration of the evidence with respect to this claim is restricted to that which was of record on September 14, 2023, and that which was submitted by the Veteran from October 16, 2024, to January 14, 2025 (the close of the 90-day period to submit additional evidence).  

Here, the record shows informal claims were received prior to the current July 2023 claim.  In September 1992, the Veteran filed a statement in which he reported that his hearing loss had increased in severity and that he had a high-pitched noise in his ears at all times that he associated with his hearing loss.  This statement was developed as a claim for an increased rating for hearing loss only, and the AOJ (agency of original jurisdiction) did not address whether tinnitus was related to hearing loss or to service.  

Even earlier, however, on May 10, 1989, the Veteran filed a formal claim for service connection for hearing loss, which referred to his treatment during service.  His STRs contain extensive testing for hearing loss.  Audiological testing in May 1983 and May 1984 show decreased hearing with accompanying tinnitus due to noise exposure.  A reference audiogram in April 1985 shows tinnitus for the preceding two to three years and a positive history of noise exposure.  Tinnitus was noted at his separation examination.  Given the similarities in etiology between hearing loss and tinnitus, and the frequency with which they are seen as comorbidities, the Board finds that this evidence is sufficient to establish that an informal claim for tinnitus was received with the May 10, 1989, claim.  Shea, supra.

If it is determined that an informal claim was received, the next inquiry is whether such a claim is pending or whether it was adjudicated as part of a final decision.  Here, the issue of service connection for tinnitus was not adjudicated until September 14, 2023, (the date of notification of the decision on that issue), and the Board does not find that it was implicitly denied in any rating decision prior to the decision on appeal.  This means that the service connection claim was still pending from May 10, 1989, when the July 2023 claim was received.

The record shows diagnoses of tinnitus during service in 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1986, and a self-report of symptoms in September 1992.  His VA treatment records show a diagnosis in July 2016, which was reaffirmed at the August 2023 VA examination. 

Tinnitus is defined as "a noise in the ears, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking.  It is usually subjective in type."  Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 1956 (31st ed. 2007).  Because tinnitus is "subjective," its existence is generally determined by whether the veteran claims to experience it.  For VA purposes, tinnitus has been specifically found to be a disorder with symptoms that can be identified through lay observation alone.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  Tinnitus is a disease considered to be chronic under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) as an 'organic disease of the nervous system.'  Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 273 (2015).

Accordingly, the Board finds that an effective date of May 10, 1989, is warranted.  The May 10, 1989, formal claim for service connection for hearing loss included an informal claim for service connection for tinnitus, based upon his direction to review STRs, which show tinnitus was diagnosed as a part of his bilateral hearing loss during his service.  That informal claim was not adjudicated.  The record shows reports of tinnitus symptoms throughout the years and a current diagnosis.  A chronic disease diagnosed during service is presumed to be service connected.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  This claim is granted.  

2. The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 10, 1989, for the grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

The Veteran was granted service connection for hearing loss in a September 1989 rating decision.  On July 25, 2023, he filed a claim for an increased rating.  He was granted a 40 percent rating effective from July 25, 2023.  He filed an appeal to the Board, noting the hearing loss had increased from 20 to 40 percent and that he disagreed with the effective date.  

It is not clear if he is appealing the effective date of the increased rating that was awarded while the claim was pending or appealing the effective date of service connection or both.  The Veteran is not represented and did indicate during his personal hearing that he was unsure of the language to use to appeal different issues.  He also mentioned during his personal hearing that his hearing loss incepted during his first period of active service, which ended in 1986, three years earlier than the current effective date.  Given this evidence, the Board construes the Veteran's appeal to be appealing the effective date of service connection and for the increased rating.

The effective date of service connection for hearing loss was assigned in a September 1989 rating decision, as May 10, 1989.  That decision was not appealed and is now final.  

Once there is a relevant final decision on an issue, as here, there cannot be a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date.  Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).  In other words, a claimant is not entitled to again raise an earlier effective service connection date claim that was established in a prior final decision. The Board notes that the Veteran is free to file a claim alleging clear and unmistakable error (CUE) with regard to the effective date assigned by the AOJ in the previous rating decisions.  As no such CUE claim has been filed here, the Board is not able to independently determine the propriety of the effective date assigned in the earlier decision.

In light of Rudd, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss must be dismissed.  Id.

3. The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 25, 2023, for the grant of service connection for residual scar status post removal of basal cell carcinoma from the scalp is denied.

The Veteran's service-connected residual scar status post removal of basal cell carcinoma from the scalp has been assigned an effective date of July 25, 2023.  This is the date of receipt of his claim for service connection.  He has appealed for an earlier effective date, arguing that he has had growths for years and the basal cell carcinoma was removed in 2006.

The residual scar status post removal of basal cell carcinoma was granted service connection in a November 2023 rating decision that had a notification date of November 13, 2023.  The record closed on this date, but reopened for 90 days on October 16, 2024, the date of his personal hearing.  The Board's consideration of the evidence with respect to this claim is restricted to that which was of record on November 13, 2023, and that which was submitted by the Veteran from October 16, 2024, to January 14, 2025 (the close of the 90-day period to submit additional evidence).

Turning to the evidence, the Board does not find a basis for granting an earlier effective date.

The Veteran did not file a formal claim for any skin, scalp, or head disability prior to the July 2023 claim.  The May 1989 formal claim did not include a skin, scalp, or head disability.  The Veteran's STRs show treatment to the scalp, but to the extent that the May 1989 formal claim may have raised an informal claim for a scalp disability, pursuant to Shea, he filed an informal claim in August 1989, for nerve damage on the scalp, which was denied in a September 1989 rating decision.  He did not appeal that decision and it is final.  

He filed another informal claim, in December 2006, for "head cancer."   This claim was denied in April 2007.  He did not appeal, and it is final.  The record does not show that any new and material evidence was received within a year of the April 2007 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  

Nothing was received from the Veteran between the April 2007 rating decision and the July 2023 claim.  The Board notes his argument pertaining to filing a claim in 2013, discussed more below, but he has not asserted that he included a claim for a skin disability with that claim.  

The Board acknowledges his argument regarding the diagnosis being made years earlier, but the effective date of service connection is assigned according to when the claim was received or when entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Here, the claim was denied in April 2007 and not appealed.  If the Veteran wishes to have that decision revisited, a motion for CUE (clear and unmistakable error) must be filed; otherwise, the Board is bound by the laws and regulations setting forth the assignment of effective dates.  There was no claim, formal or informal, received and unadjudicated after the April 2007 rating decision until receipt of the July 25, 2023, claim.  

Accordingly, an effective date earlier than July 25, 2023, for the grant of service connection for residual scar status post removal of basal cell carcinoma, is not warranted.  This claim is denied.

4. The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 25, 2023, for the grant of service connection for CAD is denied.

The Veteran's CAD has been assigned an effective date of July 25, 2023.  This is the date of receipt of his claim for service connection.  He has appealed for an earlier effective date, arguing that he has had a heart disability before July 25, 2023.

CAD was granted service connection in a September 2023 rating decision that had a notification date of September 14, 2023.  The record closed on this date, but reopened for 90 days on October 16, 2024, the date of his personal hearing.  The Board's consideration of the evidence with respect to this claim is restricted to that which was of record on September 14, 2023, and that which was submitted by the Veteran from October 16, 2024, to January 14, 2025 (the close of the 90-day period to submit additional evidence).  

Turning to the evidence, the Board does not find a basis for an earlier effective date.

There are no formal or informal claims for a heart disability prior to July 2023, and the Veteran has not so asserted.  His STRs do not show diagnosis of a heart disability during service and, thus, there is no suggestion that the May 1989 formal claim included an informal claim for service connection for the heart.  

The Board acknowledges his argument that he had CAD before July 2023, but the Board is bound by the laws and regulations setting forth the assignment of effective dates.  The effective date of service connection is assigned according to when the claim was received or when entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Here, no claim was received until receipt of the July 25, 2023, claim; thus, even though entitlement arose years earlier, the claim was not received until after that.  

Accordingly, an effective date earlier than July 25, 2023, is not warranted, and this claim is denied.  

5. The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 25, 2023, for the grant of service connection for prostate cancer is denied.

The Veteran's service-connected prostate cancer has been assigned an effective date of July 25, 2023.  This is the date of receipt of his claim for service connection.  He has appealed for an earlier effective date, arguing that filed a claim for service connection in 2013 that was never adjudicated.

Prostate cancer was granted service connection in a November 2023 rating decision that had a notification date of November 13, 2023.  The record closed on this date, but reopened for 90 days on October 16, 2024, the date of his personal hearing.  The Board's consideration of the evidence with respect to this claim is restricted to that which was of record on November 13, 2023, and that which was submitted by the Veteran from October 16, 2024, to January 14, 2025 (the close of the 90-day period to submit additional evidence).

Turning to the evidence, the record contains an informal claim for prostate cancer filed in December 2006.  This claim was denied in an April 2007 rating decision because the record did not show a current diagnosis.  That decision was not appealed, and the record does not show that new and material evidence was received within a year of the denial.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  That decision is now final. 

As mentioned above, there is nothing received from the Veteran after the April 2007 claim until the July 2023 claim.

The Veteran argues that he attempted to file a claim at the VA medical center (VAMC) in early 2013.  He reports that the woman he met with was overtly hostile and told him that his claim would likely be thrown in the garbage.  He left his claim with her.  He reports that she upset him so much that he avoided going anywhere near her area at the VAMC.  He reports that he never heard anything about that claim.

In support of his argument, he has produced a news article which explains that 20 to 30 boxes of unfiled claims and medical records were found abandoned in a storage unit that had previously been rented by a former employee of the Virginia Department of Veterans Services (DVS).  This DVS employee worked at the veterans benefits office at the Richmond VAMC in 2013, when the Veteran said he filed the claim, and she was subsequently fired.  

In December 2016, the Governor of Virginia wrote a letter to the Secretary and General Counsel for VA, advising them of the incident, and clarifying that the woman who committed the act was an employee of DVS, a state agency.  He indicated that all of the found documents had been sorted and associated with claims files or filed, and that impacted veterans were notified.  He asked that VA consider earlier effective dates with respect to the claims that were able to be filed.

Unfortunately, the record does not show that the Veteran's claim was found among the paperwork abandoned in the storage unit.  No claim dated from in or around 2013 has been associated with the file.  Nothing was associated with the Veteran's file around the time of the Governor's letter.  The Veteran has not produced evidence that he was notified that his paperwork was discovered by the State of Virginia during the effort to sort and file the documents.  Considering the evidence of record, the Board finds no basis to find that VA received the claim for prostate cancer in 2013. The Board is sympathic to the Veteran's contentions but does not find a basis in relevant law for finding that his report of submitting a claim to a state employee constituted receipt by VA.

The record is not persuasive that a claim for prostate cancer was received by VA in 2013.  As the Veteran mentioned, he attempted to file the claim via an office run by a state agency inside the VAMC.  There is no evidence that it was ever received by VA after that, and VA does not have control over non-VA employees.  Although the DVS employee was working in the VAMC, she was working as an agent of her employer, and there is no evidence regarding their procedures for accepting and filing applications at that time.    

The Board acknowledges the argument that his prostate cancer has been present for a number of years, but as mentioned above, the effective date is based on receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  The Board is bound by the law and regulations pertaining to the assignment of effective dates.   

Accordingly, an effective date earlier than July 25, 2023, is not warranted.  This claim is denied.

6. The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 25, 2023, for the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction associated with prostate cancer is denied.

The Veteran's service-connected erectile dysfunction has been assigned an effective date of July 25, 2023.  This is the date of receipt of his claim for service connection for prostate cancer and service connection for erectile dysfunction secondary to cancer.  He has appealed for an earlier effective date.

Erectile dysfunction was granted service connection in a November 2023 rating decision that had a notification date of November 13, 2023.  The record closed on this date, but reopened for 90 days on October 16, 2024, the date of his personal hearing.  The Board's consideration of the evidence with respect to this claim is restricted to that which was of record on November 13, 2023, and that which was submitted by the Veteran from October 16, 2024, to January 14, 2025 (the close of the 90-day period to submit additional evidence).

The Veteran's erectile dysfunction is shown in the record to be associated with his prostate cancer, which has an effective date of July 25, 2023.  It was granted service connection because it is caused by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  Secondary service connection is established when there is evidence of a current disability, evidence of a service-connected disability, and nexus evidence of a relationship between the two.  Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).  A secondary disability cannot have a service connection date prior to that of the primary disability; indeed, it cannot be service connected until the primary is service connected.  Id.

The Veteran argued during his hearing that he has had erectile dysfunction since in or around 2012.  To the extent that he is arguing it could have been service connected earlier secondary to his service-connected prostatitis (which was in effect from May 1989 to July 2023, at which point his rating for prostate cancer went into effect), the record does not contain a formal or informal claim for erectile dysfunction related to prostatitis prior to July 2023.  To the extent that his claim for prostate cancer in December 2006 could be construed as an informal claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction, the record did not show that erectile dysfunction had been diagnosed, and the Board finds it was implicitly denied when the claim for prostate cancer was denied.

In certain circumstances, pursuant to the "implicit denial doctrine," "a claim for benefits will be deemed to have been denied, and thus finally adjudicated, even if (VA) did not expressly address that claim in its decision." Adams v. Shinseki, 568 F.3d 956, 961 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  When a rating decision "discusses a claim in terms sufficient to put the claimant on notice that it was being considered and rejected, then it constitutes a denial of that claim even if the formal adjudicative language does not 'specifically' deny that claim."  Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 255 (2007).  In Ingram, the Court determined that, where a decision discusses a claim in terms sufficient to put the claimant on notice that it was being considered and rejected, then it constitutes a denial of that claim even if the formal adjudicative language does not "specifically" deny that claim.  Id.  The key question in the implicit denial inquiry is whether it would be clear to a reasonable person that VA's action that expressly refers to one claim is intended to dispose of others as well.  Adams, 568 F.3d at 962-963.

Later, in Cogburn v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 205 (2010), the Court enumerated four factors that must be considered when determining whether a claim was implicitly denied: (1) "The relatedness of the claims"; (2) "the specificity of the adjudication," that is, whether "the adjudication alluded to the pending claim in such a way that it could reasonably be inferred that the prior claim was denied"; (3) "the timing of the claims"; and (4) whether "the claimant is represented."  Id. at 212-14.

In determining whether a claim was previously adjudicated, the key question is whether sufficient notice was provided that would allow a claimant to reasonably understand that he would not be awarded benefits for the disability asserted in his pending claim and thus decide for himself whether to accept the decision or seek redress elsewhere.  Jones v. Shinseki, 619 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Adams, 568 F.3d at 965 ("[T]he implicit denial rule is, at bottom, a notice provision.").

The Board finds the Cogburn factors weigh in favor of finding that any informal claim for erectile dysfunction received in December 2006 was implicitly denied.  First, a claim for erectile dysfunction would be related to a claim for prostate cancer.  Second, a reasonable person would have realized that nothing related to the prostate claim was granted.  The rating decision is very clear that the Veteran did not respond to attempts to gather evidence and that his VA treatment records did not show any relevant diagnoses.  Third, if the claim contained an informal claim, it was received at the same time.  Fourth, he was represented at that time by a Veterans Service Organization (VSO), which weighs in favor of finding an implicit denial. The Veteran was not presenting his claim unassisted, and although his claim must still be read in the most sympathetic light, the fact that he had a representative may be considered in determining whether he was apprised of his rights and of all the available methods for obtaining benefits.  The Board notes that his representative was not an attorney, but that special legal expertise was not required to realize that nothing had been granted and the reasons why.  See Comer v. Peake, 552 F.3d 1362 (2009). 

Thus, to the extent that the December 2006 informal claim for prostate cancer included an informal claim for erectile dysfunction on a direct basis, it was implicitly denied in the April 2007 rating decision.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reports regarding the onset of his erectile dysfunction but is bound by the laws and regulations pertaining to assignment of effective dates.  Here, there is no basis to assign an effective date earlier than the current effective date of July 25, 2023.  This claim must be denied.

7. The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 25, 2023, for the grant of service connection for right knee disability, is denied.

8. The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 25, 2023, for the grant of service connection for left knee disability, is denied.

The Veteran's service-connected right and left knee disabilities have been assigned effective dates of July 25, 2023.  This is the date of receipt of his claim for service connection.  He has appealed for an earlier effective date, arguing that he has had knee disabilities since before July 25, 2023.

The right and left knee were granted service connection in a September 2023 rating decision that had a notification date of September 14, 2023.  The record closed on this date, but reopened for 90 days on October 16, 2024, the date of his personal hearing.  The Board's consideration of the evidence with respect to these claims is restricted to that which was of record on September 14, 2023, and that which was submitted by the Veteran from October 16, 2024, to January 14, 2025 (the close of the 90-day period to submit additional evidence).  

Turning to the evidence, the Board does not find a basis for an earlier effective date for either knee.

There are no formal or informal claims for a knee disability prior to July 2023, and the Veteran has not so asserted.  His STRs do not show disabilities of either knee during service and, thus, there is no suggestion that the May 1989 formal claim for other disabilities included an informal claim for service connection for either knee.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's argument that he had right and left knee disabilities before July 2023, but the Board is bound by the laws and regulations setting forth the assignment of effective dates.  The effective date of service connection is assigned according to when the claim was received or when entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Here, no claim for either knee was received until receipt of the July 25, 2023, claim; thus, even though entitlement might have arose years earlier, the claim was not received until after that.  

Accordingly, effective dates earlier than July 25, 2023, are not warranted for the knees, and these claims are denied. 

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity and individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes (DCs).  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

9. The claim of entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

The Veteran's tinnitus is rated 10 percent disabling under DC 6260, which awards 10 percent for recurrent tinnitus.  38 C.F.R. § 4.87.  

Tinnitus was granted service connection in a September 2023 rating decision.  The rating was continued at 10 percent in the November 2023 rating decision, which the Veteran appealed.  Therefore, the record closed November 13, 2023, the date of notification of that decision, and reopened for 90 days on October 16, 2024, the date of his personal hearing.  The Board's consideration of the evidence with respect to this claim is restricted to that which was of record on November 13, 2023, and that which was submitted by the Veteran from October 16, 2024, to January 14, 2025 (the close of the 90-day period to submit additional evidence).  

Tinnitus is defined as "a noise in the ears, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking.  It is usually subjective in type."  Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 1956 (31st ed. 2007).  

The maximum schedular rating available for tinnitus is 10 percent.  Currently, the Veteran's tinnitus is already evaluated as 10 percent disabling.  Thus, there is no legal basis upon which to award an increased rating for tinnitus on a schedular basis, and the Veteran's appeal must be denied.  See Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reports during the August 2023 examination, that tinnitus disrupts his sleep, and during his personal hearing, that it is painful at times.  The disruption caused by the symptoms of tinnitus is contemplated by the diagnostic criteria.  

The Board finds that, while pain is not explicitly listed under DC 6260, the disruption caused by occasional pain is also contemplated by the rating criteria.  The Veteran did not report having pain that he attributed to tinnitus during the examination and the symptom is not otherwise shown in his current treatment records that were available at the time of the decision on review.  During the hearing he mentioned pain for the first time, and he did not provide detail on the frequency or severity of this symptom.  Because this symptom had not been part of the record on the date of notification of the decision on appeal, the AOJ did not commit a duty to assist error prior to the issuance of the decision on appeal in not obtaining a VA medical opinion that addresses this symptom, and the Board may not remand to obtain it because there was no duty to assist error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Indeed, the Board finds the August 2023 VA examination to be adequate based upon the evidence of record in November 2023.  It was based on a review of the record and an in-person examination, and the Veteran was given an opportunity to report his symptoms.  He has not raised any issues with the examination.

The record does not otherwise show or suggest any symptoms of tinnitus that are not addressed by the currently assigned rating under DC 6260, which pertains to tinnitus.  38 C.F.R. § 4.87.  The record does not show that he has any other symptoms that might suggest that tinnitus causes or aggravates any other disability, and so a separate rating or a rating under a different diagnostic code is not warranted via secondary service connection.  Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162, 164 (2019).  The record does not show or suggest that his tinnitus symptoms would cause marked interference with his employment or has caused frequent periods of hospitalization.  Thus, a referral for extraschedular consideration is also not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b).  

In sum, a rating higher than 10 percent for tinnitus is not available and this claim must be denied.  The Veteran is advised that if he has evidence pertaining to pain associated with tinnitus, then he should file it along with a supplemental claim within a year of this decision.

10. The claim of entitlement to an initial rating higher than 30 percent for CAD is denied.

The Veteran's CAD is currently rated 30 percent disabling under DC 7005, which pertains to arteriosclerotic heart disease.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104.  He has appealed for a higher rating.

The Veteran's CAD was granted service connection in a September 2023 rating decision that had a notification date of September 14, 2023.  The record closed on this date, but reopened for 90 days on October 16, 2024, the date of his personal hearing.  The Board's consideration of the evidence with respect to this claim is restricted to that which was of record on September 14, 2023, and that which was submitted by the Veteran from October 16, 2024, to January 14, 2025 (the close of the 90-day period to submit additional evidence).  

Arteriosclerotic heart disease is rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart, which provides for a 10 percent rating when a workload of 7.1 to 10 METs results in heart failure symptoms; or continuous medication is required for control.  A 30 percent rating is warranted when a workload of 5.1 to 7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms; or evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent.  A 60 percent rating is warranted when a workload of 3.1 to 5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms.  A 100 percent rating is warranted when a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005.

A note (2) defines one MET (metabolic equivalent) as the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute.  When the level of METs at which dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope may be used.

A note (3) indicates that, for purposes of the general formula, heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope.  

Turning to the evidence, the Board does not find that a rating higher than 30 percent is warranted.  The August 2023 VA examination shows that he could not perform an exercise based test because it would not be possible to do it without significant health risk, and so an interview-based METs test was conducted.  The results show that the Veteran experiences breathlessness and fatigue with workloads of 5.1 to 7.0 METs, which is consistent with activities such as walking one flight of stairs, golfing without a cart, mowing the lawn with a push mower, and heavy yard work digging.  He was also shown to have cardiac hypertrophy.  These results correspond to a 30 percent rating.  Id.

None of his treatment records show that a lower METs level caused symptoms of heart failure.  

The Board finds that the AOJ properly developed this claim, and that the VA examination is adequate for adjudication.  The Veteran has not raised any issues with the VA examination report.

Accordingly, a rating higher than 30 percent for CAD is not warranted.  The Veteran is advised that if he has evidence that he thinks is relevant to the initial rating assigned for his CAD, he should file it along with a supplemental claim within a year of this decision.

11. An initial 10 percent rating effective July 25, 2023, for right knee limited flexion due to degenerative arthritis, is granted.

12. The claim of entitlement to an initial rating higher than 10 percent for right knee limited extension due to degenerative arthritis is denied.

13. An initial 10 percent rating effective July 25, 2023, for left knee limited flexion due to degenerative arthritis, is granted.

14. The claim of entitlement to an initial rating higher than 10 percent for left knee limited extension due to degenerative arthritis is denied.

The Veteran has appealed the initial ratings assigned to his right and left knees. 

The right and left knee were granted service connection in a September 2023 rating decision that had a notification date of September 14, 2023.  The record closed on this date, but reopened for 90 days on October 16, 2024, the date of his personal hearing.  The Board's consideration of the evidence with respect to these claims is restricted to that which was of record on September 14, 2023, and that which was submitted by the Veteran from October 16, 2024, to January 14, 2025 (the close of the 90-day period to submit additional evidence).

The Board notes that some of the evidence the Veteran submitted during the reopened 90-day period is dated after the issuance of the decision on review.  For example, there is a private record of knee treatment dated from July 2024 among the evidence submitted.  The Veteran's knees are service connected effective from July 25, 2023, and the decision was issued September 14, 2023.  This is the period on review, from July 25, 2023, to September 14, 2023.  In regard to any evidence dated after September 14, 2023, the Veteran is advised that if he wishes to have it reviewed in conjunction with the initial ratings of the knees, he should file a supplemental claim referring to this evidence within a year of this decision.

The Veteran's right and left knees are both rated 10 percent disabling under DC 5003-5261, which pertains to degenerative arthritis rated as limited extension, and 0 percent disabling under DC 5003-5260, which pertains to degenerative arthritis rated as limited flexion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Under DC 5003, ratings are assigned on the basis of limitation of motion, which have been awarded.  Id.  Under DC 5003, if the range of motion measurements are noncompensable, ratings are assigned based on the number of joints involved and whether there are incapacitating episodes.  Here, though, his range of motion measurements are compensable, as discussed below, and, when combined, amount to a higher benefit than the ratings available based on the number of joints involved and whether there are incapacitating episodes, and thus, the Board need not address this diagnostic code any further.

Limited extension is rated under DC 5261, which assigns a 0 percent rating when extension is limited to 5 degrees; a 10 percent rating when limited to 10 degrees; a 20 percent rating when limited to 15 degrees; a 30 percent rating when limited to 20 degrees; a 40 percent rating when limited to 30 degrees; and a 50 percent rating when limited to 45 degrees.  Id., DC 5261. 

Limited flexion is rated under DC 5260, which assigns a 0 percent rating when flexion is limited to 60 degrees; a 10 percent rating when limited to 45 degrees; a 20 percent rating when limited to 30 degrees; and, a 30 percent rating when limited to 15 degrees.  38 C.F.R. §?4.71a, DC 5260.  

Normal range of motion of the knee is from 0 to 140 degrees.  Id., Plate II. 

When evaluating disabilities on the basis of limited motion, it is necessary to consider both the schedular criteria and any functional loss due to flare-ups of pain, fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, and weakness.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?202 (1995).  Pain on movement, swelling, deformity,?or atrophy of disuse are relevant factors in regard to joint disability.  38?C.F.R. §?4.45.  Painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to a healed injury, are entitled to at least the minimal compensable rating for the joint.  38?C.F.R. §?4.59.  Pursuant?to 38?C.F.R. §?4.59, painful motion should be considered limited motion, even though a range of motion may be possible beyond the point when pain sets in.  See Powell v. West, 13?Vet. App.?31, 34 (1999); Hicks v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?417, 421 (1995).

Turning to the evidence, the Board notes that the record shows that examination of the knees reveal the exact same symptoms for each, and so the Board will discuss them at the same time.  The record shows the Veteran's worst range of motion testing results came from the August 2023 VA examination.  His initial range of motion, for both knees, was shown to be from 5 to 100 degrees.  This evidence does not correspond to a higher rating under either diagnostic code.  

The Board considered whether his functional loss warranted a higher rating.  The Veteran had pain in both extension and flexion, in weight- and non-weight-bearing positions, and with active and passive motion.  His pain was noted to cause functional loss, including limitations in prolonged bending, sitting/driving, turning or twisting, standing for longer than 1 hour, walking for longer than 30 minutes, or running at all.  He was able to perform three repetitions, which did not show increased severity in range of motion, but the examiner opined that pain and fatigability would significantly limit function during flares and after repetitive use over time.  She opined his range of motion would be reduced to be from 10 to 60 degrees.  This range of motion corresponds with his current 10 and 0 percent ratings for extension and flexion, respectively.

In regard to extension, the Board does not find a rating higher than 10 percent is warranted for either knee.  This 10 percent is based on his functional loss and the examiner's opinion on the extent of his loss during flares and after repetitive use.  There is no evidence and the Veteran has not so alleged that his extension was ever reduced to 15 degrees or to that level of loss during the period on review, which is required for the next higher rating.  Deluca, supra.  Indeed, the only other range of motion measurements are dated in January 2023, before the period on review, and they are normal.  The examiner considered all of the evidence and opined that the Veteran's extension on both knees would be functionally limited to 10 degrees, or to the equivalent of 10 degrees extension, which warrants a 10 percent rating.  A 20 percent rating is not warranted for limited extension for either the right or left knee.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261.

In regard to flexion, the Board finds that a 10 percent rating is warranted based on functional loss caused by painful motion with reduced range of motion.  Deluca, supra; 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  Separate ratings are permitted when both limited flexion and extension are shown.  VAOPGCPREC 9-2004 (September 17, 2004).  Indeed, they have already been awarded by the AOJ.  Here, the Veteran's flexion is opined to be functionally reduced to 60 degrees, which is significantly limited compared to full flexion (140 degrees), and with his painful motion, the Board finds a compensable rating is warranted for limited flexion for both knees.  Id.; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5260.    

A higher 20 percent rating is not warranted for limited flexion for either knee.  Even in taking his functional loss into consideration, the record does not show or suggest that his flexion was ever reduced to 30 degrees or to that level of loss, and the Veteran has not so asserted.  Rather, the examiner opined his flexion would reduce to 60 degrees when his symptoms are at their worst (during flares and after repetitive use over time), which well-exceeds the criteria for a 20 percent rating.  Id.

The record shows the Veteran's private treatment provider diagnosed mild varus/valgus laxity at a January 2023 treatment appointment.  The Board considered whether a separate rating under DC 5257, which pertains to recurrent subluxation or lateral instability, was warranted, but does not find the evidence supports finding that this is a chronic symptom.  The Veteran was not diagnosed with any instability at the VA examination, and the record does not otherwise show a sprain or ligament tear or a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex.  He did report during his hearing that he has worn a knee brace, but he indicated that was for pain and not because of instability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257.  

The VA examination and other treatment records show swelling and effusion, respectively.  The Board considered assigning a rating under DC 5258, which provides for a 20 percent rating when there is dislocated semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  However, he has not complained of locking, and the record does not otherwise show dislocated semilunar cartilage.  A rating under DC 5258 is not warranted.  Similarly, he has not had the semilunar cartilage of either knee removed, thus a rating under DC 5259 is also not warranted.  Id.

The record does not show that the Veteran has ankylosis, impairment of the tibia and fibular, or genu recurvatum, thus separate ratings under DCs 5256, 5262, or 5263 are not warranted.

The Board notes that, during his personal hearing, the Veteran raised the issue of whether his knees disabilities have caused or aggravated any acquired psychiatric disability when he commented that he has "emotional pain" when he has to decline from participating in activities due to the pain from his knees.  However, the record at the time of the decision on appeal did not show or suggest a relationship between the knees and any diagnosed acquired psychiatric disability, thus, the AOJ did not commit a duty to assist error in failing to develop this issue prior to the decision on review, and the Board cannot remand this issue for development without that error.  The Board does not find that the record on review shows, approximately as likely as not, that there is a relationship, but advises the Veteran that if he has any evidence supporting the proposition that any of his service-connected disability caused or aggravated an acquired psychiatric disability, then he should file it along with a claim as soon as possible. 

The Board finds this claim has been adequately developed.  He has been provided a VA examination that is adequate for adjudication.  The VA examiner complied with the holdings in Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2017), and Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), and conducted thorough examinations.  The Veteran has not raised any issues with the examination or the development undertaken in conjunction with this claim.  

In sum, the Board is denying a higher rating for both knees' reduced extension, but granting a 10 percent initial rating for both knees' reduced flexion.  The Veteran is advised that if he has any evidence relevant to the rating assigned to either knee that he wishes considered in conjunction with the initial ratings, then he should file a supplemental claim within a year of this decision.      

15. The claim of entitlement to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction is denied.

The Veteran has appealed for an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction. The Veteran noted his use of medication.

Erectile dysfunction was granted service connection in a November 2023 rating decision that had a notification date of November 13, 2023.  The record closed on this date, but reopened for 90 days on October 16, 2024, the date of his personal hearing.  The Board's consideration of the evidence with respect to this claim is restricted to that which was of record on November 13, 2023, and that which was submitted by the Veteran from October 16, 2024, to January 14, 2025 (the close of the 90-day period to submit additional evidence).

Erectile dysfunction is rated noncompensably under DC 7522.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115b.  The amended version of this diagnostic code has been applicable for the entire period on review, which provides for a noncompensable rating for erectile dysfunction, with or without penile deformity.  The record does not indicate any other basis for a compensable rating.  Thus, the Veteran has the maximum rating available for erectile dysfunction.  He also has SMC(k) (special monthly compensation) on account of loss of use of creative organ.

The record does not show or suggest any symptoms caused by his erectile dysfunction that are not contemplated by the rating criteria.  Accordingly, a separate rating is not warranted.

The Board finds that the VA examination is adequate for adjudication.  The record does not show or suggest any symptoms associated with erectile dysfunction that require clarification, and the Veteran has raised no objections.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that a compensable rating is not warranted, and this claim is denied.

16. The claim of entitlement to a TDIU is mooted.

The Veteran reported during his personal hearing that he was concerned about the permanence of his current total rating that is assigned for his prostate cancer, which is rated 100 percent while active.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528.  He also reported during his hearing that he had not been employed since in or around 2013.  Finally, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's heart and knee disabilities would impair the Veteran from performing occupational tasks that require routine physical strain, prolonged bending, prolonged sitting or driving, turning or twisting, standing for more than one hour, walking longer than 30 minutes, or running at all.  The Board finds that all of this evidence, taken together, raises the issue of entitlement to TDIU as part and parcel of the Veteran's appeals for higher ratings for the heart and the knees.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453 (2009).  This means it is considered pending from the date of service connection for those claims (July 25, 2023).

Where a veteran's schedular rating is less than total, a total disability rating may nevertheless be assigned when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided certain requirements are met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Here, currently, the Veteran's combined rating is 100 percent, which moots a claim for TDIU.  The record shows that both his knees and heart would impair some employment activities, but does not suggest that his heart or either knee, alone, would preclude the Veteran from obtaining and maintaining substantial gainful employment.  

Even if the record did show that one single disability caused unemployability, entitlement to TDIU continues to be moot because the Veteran is already in receipt of SMC(s), which is available when a claimant has one disability rated as total, either by virtue of a 100 percent schedular rating or a TDIU based on one disability, and additional disabilities with a combined rating of 60 percent of more.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  That is, another disability rated 100 percent disabling would not avail the Veteran of a higher benefit.  Accordingly, the AOJ did not commit a duty to assist error in failing to develop this claim, which was arguably raised by the VA examination opinion.

However, as the Veteran appears to be aware, there remains the possibility that his rating for prostate cancer could be reduced once treatment is completed.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528.  The Veteran is advised to file a supplemental claim for a TDIU if he receives a notification that his rating for prostate cancer is changing.

In sum, the Veteran is in receipt of a combined 100 percent rating, and he also has SMC(s), thus his inferred claim for TDIU is mooted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. The claim of entitlement to service connection for glaucoma is remanded.

VA has a duty to assist claimants in developing claims, including obtaining evidence and scheduling VA examinations.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).  If a VA examination is provided, it must be adequate.  Here, a VA examination was provided but the opinion on whether service connection is warranted is inadequate.

The Veteran is presumed to be exposed to the herbicides described in 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6) on account of his service in the Republic of Vietnam.  The Veteran asserts glaucoma is related to this exposure.  

An October 2023 toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) memorandum notes there is evidence in the file that the Veteran served in a country listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e)(2) and/or 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 and/or 38 U.S.C. § 1119, which means he is presumed to be exposed to fine particulate matter under 38 C.F.R. § 3.320.

When a claim involves toxic exposure risk activities (TERA), as here, and there is evidence of a disability that may be related, VA must obtain a medical opinion addressing the possibility of a nexus between the claimed disability and the TERA.  38 U.S.C. §1168(a)(1).  If there is more than one TERA, the opinion must consider "the synergistic combined effects" of all of them. 

Eye disorders and glaucoma are not presumed to be associated with herbicide exposure.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).  Additionally, the Secretary of VA has determined based on cumulative scientific data reported by the National Academies of Science since 1993 that disorders of the eye have no positive association with herbicide exposure.  38 U.S.C. § 1168(b), VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 11 (Dec. 22, 2022) (VA PACT Act Policy Letter for Sub-Regulatory Guidance); Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).  However, if VA obtains a medical opinion for the purpose of resolving a claim, it must be adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).

Here, the AOJ committed a duty to assist error in relying on the August 2023 VA examination opinion.  The medical opinion obtained in connection with this appeal is vague and does not adequately address the Veteran's exposures or their synergistic combined effect.  The VA medical opinion indicated that exposure to "toxic vapor" would not cause an internal eye disease, but did not provide additional explanation, or clearly indicate the toxic vapor she was addressing.  

Further, the Veteran's STRs do show that he had conjunctivitis while in service, in June 1968, which should be addressed.    

An updated medical opinion must be obtained.

2. The claim of entitlement to a rating higher than 40 percent for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

The Board has liberally construed the Veteran's appeal to the Board to include an appeal of the disability rating assigned to his hearing loss.  He indicated on his appeal to the Board that his area of disagreement was the effective date.  As the rating decision granted an increased rating of an already established service-connected disability, this would be the effective date of that increase.  An appeal for a different effective date of an increased rating is essentially an appeal for a higher rating for a specific time period.  The Board addressed the possibility that he was seeking an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection above.

Here, the Board finds the AOJ committed a duty to assist error prior to the issuance of the decision on appeal.  Specifically, the VA examination showed that the Veteran's left ear could not be given speech discrimination testing because he could not "tolerate" it.  The examiner did not adequately explain the issue with that testing or whether steps could be taken so that he could tolerate it, including the possibility of rescheduling the test.  Further, the VA examiner did not provide certification that use of speech discrimination testing was not appropriate for this Veteran or his left ear.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85(c).  It was error to not have obtained this opinion or an updated hearing test that contains speech discrimination testing for both ears.  On remand, this error will be corrected.   

3. The claim of entitlement to an initial rating higher than 10 percent for residual scar status post removal of basal cell carcinoma from the scalp is remanded.

The Veteran's claim for service connection has not been adequately developed.  The Veteran's claim for service connection noted a desire to service connect "head cancer (skin)" and "cancerous lesions of the head/scalp/face and neck."  He also, in August and September 2023, filed photographs of his skin which appear to show multiple moles or growths.  Given the receipt of these photographs and his claim for multiple "lesions," the AOJ should have asked the VA examiner to provide diagnoses and medical opinions on whether there is a relationship to service or whether they are also residuals of the Veteran's excised basal cell carcinoma.   Rather, the VA examiner only noted the one residual scar, and did not address any of the other growths.  This was error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).  

On remand, an opinion that adequately addresses all of the growths on the head, scalp, face, and neck, shall be obtained.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Forward the claims file to an appropriate examiner for an opinion on whether it is approximately as likely as not that the Veteran's glaucoma is related to his active duty service, to include consideration of in-service toxic exposures, which include herbicides and fine particulate matter.  In doing so, the examiner must consider: (a) the total potential exposures through all applicable military deployments; and, (b) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities.  

The examiner should refer to the relevant literature prior to opining.  The examiner is advised that "approximately as likely as not" means that evidence for and against service connection is nearly equal or in approximate balance; a higher degree of certainty is not requested nor required.  All opinions must be supported with explanation.

2. Schedule the Veteran for an appropriate examination for a report on the current severity of bilateral hearing loss.  The examiner is asked to conduct a thorough examination.  

If unable to conduct speech discrimination testing, the examiner is asked (a) to explain why, and (b) to provide an opinion as to whether use of the speech discrimination test is not appropriate because of language difficulties, inconsistent discrimination scores, or some other reason, including his inability to tolerate the testing.  The August 2023 VA examiner did not conduct speech discrimination testing for the left ear, noting the Veteran could not "tolerate" it, but without explaining what that meant and without opining whether use of the test was appropriate for the Veteran at all.  

All opinions must be supported with explanation.  

3. Schedule the Veteran for an appropriate examination of the head, scalp, face, and neck for an opinion on the current severity of the residuals of basal cell carcinoma excision and for an opinion on whether it is approximately as likely as not that any of the growths and lesions on the Veteran's head, scalp, face, and neck are related to his service.  The examiner should elicit from the Veteran a detailed history of the scars, growths, and lesions he is talking about and provide a diagnosis for each.

In considering service connection, that examiner is asked to provide the following opinions:

(a) Whether any of the growths or lesions are approximately as likely as not related to in-service toxic exposures, to include herbicides and fine particulate matter.  The examiner must consider: (i) the total potential exposures through all applicable military deployments; and, (ii) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities.  

(b) The examiner is also asked to consider whether any of the growths or lesions represent an (i) undiagnosed illness, or (ii) are part of a MUCMI (medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness).  

A MUCMI means a diagnosed illness without conclusive pathophysiology or etiology that is characterized by overlapping symptoms and signs and has features such as fatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical findings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory abnormalities.  The examiner is asked to opine on whether there is conclusive or partially conclusive pathophysiology AND etiology.   

(c) The examiner is asked whether it is approximately as likely as not that any growth or lesion is directly related to service.  His STRs show the removal of a cyst from the forehead in January 1977, and that he was diagnosed with a keloid on the neck in July 1979 and on the scalp in July 1983.  An October 1986 physical examination shows keloids on the back of the head and on the neck. 

The examiner should refer to the relevant literature prior to opining.  The examiner is advised that "approximately as likely as not" means that evidence for and against service connection is nearly equal or in approximate balance; a higher degree of certainty is not requested nor required.  All opinions must be supported with explanation.
