REMAND

Validity of a debt in the amount of $52,733.62 for educational assistance benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 2001 to November 2005. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2020 administrative decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In January 2021, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) under the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). In such election, the Veteran requested Direct Review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Consequently, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the administrative decision on August 18, 2020. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.301.

Validity of a debt in the amount of $52,733.62 for educational assistance benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

Although the Board regrets the additional delay, a remand is necessary to ensure that due process is followed and that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claim so that he is afforded every possible consideration. See 38 U.S.C. ยง 5103A; 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.159.

The Veteran contends a debt was created when his enrollment status changed without his permission, but that he has $23,817.03 paid to him by Veterans Readiness and Employment Service (VR&E) to return to VA. See January 2021 VA Form 10182.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the administrative decision on appeal is not associated with the Veteran's claims file. Thus, for reasons detailed below, the Board is unable to determine the correct amount of the Veteran's overpayment. However, it appears the overpayment stems from the Veteran's receiving both Chapter 33 and Chapter 31 benefits while attending Charles Stuart School for the April 15, 2019 to January 21, 2020 term. In this regard, a Veteran may only use one type of education benefit at a time and the Veteran's VR&E benefits were formally discontinued effective December 3, 2020. A July 2020 email stated the Veteran's debt resulting from the payment of benefits under both Chapter 33 and Chapter 31 was $52,733.62. Thereafter, November and December 2020 emails discuss an overpayment of $14,000. 

However, a January 13, 2021 memorandum stated the Veteran was owed $21,049.22 for subsistence payments. Thereafter, a February 9, 2021 Debt Management Center (DMC) letter stated the Veteran owed $24,073.87 in housing allowance. 

In response to the Veteran's inquiry, in February 2021, a Veterans Claims Examiner (VCE) conducted an audit of the Veteran's account for the period April 15, 2019 to January 21, 2020. The audit revealed an overpayment of $38,023.33. However, immediately following, a March 9, 2021 letter informed the Veteran he owed $9,805.78 for an overpayment in his subsistence allowance.

Thus, the Board is unable to determine the correct amount of the Veteran's overpayment. Given that it is not clear how the AOJ calculated the overpayment for books and supplies, a remand is required to obtain a detailed, yet straightforward, accounting showing how this debt was calculated.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate the August 18, 2020 administrative decision on appeal with the Veteran's file.

2. Complete an audit as to how the Veteran's overpayment of Chapter 33 and Chapter 31 payments was calculated for the period of April 15, 2019 to January 21, 2020. All amounts paid for housing, tuition, and books and supplies, to include the dates on which those payments were made, for each term must be listed separately and with specificity.

Then, provide a detailed, yet straightforward, accounting showing how the total overpayment debt was calculated, to include how the AOJ arrived at payments for any partial terms of schooling.
