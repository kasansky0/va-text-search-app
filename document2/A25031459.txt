ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for ischemic heart disease is granted. 

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran served in the Republic of Vietnam in January 1972. 

2. The Veteran's prostate cancer and ischemic heart disease manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more following service. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for ischemic heart disease have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1113, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1113, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Air Force from September 1970 to April 1974. The Board thanks the Veteran for his service. 

In May 2020, the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2020 rating decision. 

In September 2020, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the April 13, 2020, rating decision.

In the October 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on May 30, 2024, and a transcript has been associated with the record. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the April 2020 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

The Veteran's claim for service connection for prostate cancer was subject to prior denials, most recently in July 2017. In the April 2020 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been received sufficient to readjudicate the claim, and the Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 CFR § 3.104(c).

The Board further notes that the Veteran was granted service connection for both coronary artery disease and prostate cancer, effective November 12, 2023, in February and March 2025 AOJ decisions, pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act). However, as these later claims based on liberalizing PACT Act provisions were "separate and distinct" from the Veteran's prior claims and assigned effective dates after the current appeal period, the appeal is not moot. Johnson v. Collins, No. 23-7589 at 10 (Vet. App. Mar. 26, 2025) (citing Spencer v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 283, 288-89 (1993)).

1. Entitlement to service connection for ischemic heart disease.

2. Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer.

The Veteran contends that he suffers from ischemic heart disease and prostate cancer residuals due to herbicide agent exposure while serving at Nakhon Phanom, Royal Thai Air Force Base (RTAFB), Thailand. He also contends that he was deployed to Da Nang, Republic of Vietnam in January 1972. 

Generally, to establish service connection for a claimed disorder, the following must be shown: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active service and has contracted an enumerated disability, including prostate cancer and ischemic heart disease, to a degree of 10 percent or more disabling at any time after service, service connection is warranted even though there is no record of such disease during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a)(6), 3.309(e).

Any veteran who served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning January 9, 1962 and ending on May 7, 1975; served in or near the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) during the period beginning on September 1, 1967, and August 31, 1971; or performed service in the Air Force or Air Force Reserve under circumstances in which the individual concerned regularly and repeatedly operated, maintained, or served onboard C-123 aircraft known to have been used to spray an herbicide agent during the Vietnam era shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1116, 1116A, 1116B; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6). 

In August 2022, the PACT Act was signed into law. In pertinent part, the PACT Act amended 38 U.S.C. § 1116 by expanding the eligibility for presumptive service connection due to herbicide agent exposure. Under the Act, Veterans who served in Thailand at any United States or Royal Thai base during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on June 20, 1976, are now eligible for presumptive service connection due to presumed herbicide agent exposure.

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). Lay testimony is competent to prove that a claimant exhibited certain lay-observable symptoms and the time that those symptoms appeared. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). The Board can find lay statements competent and sufficient to establish that a condition existed if the lay statements are used to support a later diagnosis. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Davidson, 581 F.3d at 1316.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. It is the policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent with the facts in each case, with all reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the claimant; however, the reasonable doubt rule is not a means for reconciling actual conflict or a contradiction in the evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

When all of the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).

The Board notes that it has reviewed all of the evidence of record, with an emphasis on the evidence relevant to this appeal. Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, every piece of evidence. Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (VA must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence.) Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or does not show, as to the claim.

In the April 2020 rating decision, the AOJ found that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a prostate cancer disability and with ischemic cardiomyopathy. There was also a favorable finding that the Veteran was exposed to Agent Orange during military service. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 CFR § 3.104(c). According to a private medical opinion submitted by the Veteran on the day of his May 2024 Board hearing, he had been treated for ischemic heart disease since March 2016. Therefore, the first and second elements of service connection (current disability) is met as to both claims. 

With respect to a nexus to service, the Veteran reports that he was sent on a temporary duty (TDY) assignment to Vietnam in January 1972. See February 2020 statement in support. The Board notes that while the Veteran's service personnel records document his assignment to Nakhon Phanom RTAFB, they are silent as to a TDY to Vietnam. In October 2017, the Veteran submitted a letter from a squadron mate whom he served with in Thailand. According to the letter, the Veteran was among a group of a mechanics who volunteered to go to Da Nang to repair his squadron commander's battle-damaged helicopter in January 1972. According to an April 1972 performance evaluation, the Veteran maintained helicopters that would fly frequent combat missions.  

In January 2020, the Veteran submitted black-and-white photographs, including some which appear to show the interior of a helicopter and a semi-rural village or town. He reports that these photographs were taken on his TDY to Da Nang. See May 2024 Hearing transcript. 

Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran was in Da Nang in January 1972. As such, he had service in the Republic of Vietnam within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a) and is presumed to have been exposed to an herbicide agent during such service. 

Further, the Board finds that his prostate cancer and ischemic heart disease became manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more after service. 

Under 38 CFR § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528, a 100 percent evaluation is warranted for benign neoplasms of the genitourinary system. A July 2011 private treatment record notes a diagnosis of prostate carcinoma.

Under 38 CFR § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7006, a 100 percent evaluation is warranted during and for three months following myocardial infarction, confirmed by laboratory tests. A February 2016 private treatment record notes a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).  

To summarize, the AOJ made a favorable finding of a diagnosis of prostate cancer and a private treatment record notes a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. The Board further finds that these disabilities manifested to a compensable degree following service. As the Veteran had presumptive herbicide agent exposure by nature of his service in the Republic of Vietnam, and prostate cancer and ischemic heart disease are presumptively linked to such exposure, the Board finds that these disabilities are related to service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e). The claims are granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
