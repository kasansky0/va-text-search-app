ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection prior to January 4, 2021, for left knee instability is denied.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On March 23, 2015, the Veteran initiated his claim, which was finalized on April 2, 2015, to reopen his previously denied claim for service connection for a left knee disorder.

2. In a rating decision issued on July 2, 2015, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for a left knee disorder, finding that the evidence submitted was not new and material.

3. On July 6, 2015, the AOJ issued a notification letter advising the Veteran that, as no additional evidence had been received that his claim was denied.

4. On July 27, 2015, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 21-0958).

5. On June 10, 2019, a Statement of the Case, issued by the AOJ denied service connection for a left knee disorder. 

6. An April 23, 2020, Board decision, found that new and material evidence had been received, thus the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disorder was reopened and service connection was granted.

7. In a rating decision issued on January 5, 2021, the AOJ granted service connection for left knee instability with an evaluation of 10 percent effective March 23, 2015. 

8. In a rating decision issued on July 12, 2021, pursuant to a Higher-Level Review, the AOJ found that a clear and unmistakable error was found in the effective date assigned for service connection for left knee instability; and therefore, proposed a later effective date of January 4, 2021.

9. In a rating decision issued on November 3, 2021, the AOJ found that a clear and unmistakable error was found in the effective date assigned for service connection for left knee instability; and therefore, granted a later effective date of January 4, 2021, the earliest date of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to January 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for left knee instability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served from August 1980 to November 1985. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in November 2021 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). In December 2023, the Veteran timely appealed such rating decision by submitting a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2021 AOJ decision, which was subject to review in the January 2023 Higher Level Review rating decision, a. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that the Veteran's December 2023, VA Form 10182 also included the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for his left knee instability. However, the Veteran limited his appeal to the instant issue in the November 2021 rating decision. Accordingly, the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for left knee instability is not on appeal.  

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to January 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for left knee instability. 

The Veteran contends that an effective date prior to January 4, 2021, is warranted for the award of service connection for left knee instability.

In this regard, the assignment of an effective date for an award is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on a claim for service connection or for an increase of compensation "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore." 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The effective date for an award of service connection is the day after separation from service or day entitlement arose, if a claim is received within one year of separation from service, otherwise the date of receipt of claim, or the day entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i). The effective date based on new and material evidence other than service department records received after the final disallowance is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (q)(1)(ii). Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (r), the effective date based on a reopened claim is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110.

A claim for VA benefits, whether formal or informal, must be in writing and must identify the benefit sought. 38 U.S.C. § 5101; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.151, 3.155; Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377 (1999). Prior to March 24, 2015, any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if the formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of the receipt of the informal claim. Id. 

By way of background, the record reflects that VA received the Veteran's original claim for service connection for a left knee disorder on May 24, 2010. In a September 2010 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for a left knee disorder on the basis that there was no evidence of permanent residual or chronic disability subject to service connection as shown by the medical records or demonstrated by evidence following service. 

In December 2010, the Veteran filed a claim to reopen his previously denied claim for service connection for a left knee disorder. In January 2012 the Veteran underwent a VA examination, at which time the examiner found no evidence of a left leg disorder. Upon examination, the Veteran reported that he experienced leg pain; however, he was unable to state specific symptoms other than pain and joint stability testing was normal. 

The Veteran underwent a subsequent VA examination in October 2012, at which time a diagnosis of left knee strain and degenerative joint disease was rendered. Upon examination the Veteran reported knee pain since service. However, the joint stability testing was normal. 

In a January 2013 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for a left knee disorder, based on the VA examiner's opinion that the Veteran's degenerative joint disease of the left knee was not due to or caused by his in-service bilateral knee strain.

In May 2013, the Veteran filed a claim to reopen his previously denied claim for service connection for a left knee disorder. However, in the January 2014 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for a left knee disorder, finding no new and material evidence had been submitted. 

In April 2014, the Veteran again filed to reopen his previously denied claim for service connection for a left knee disorder. In support of his claim, he submitted a disability benefits questionnaire, completed by a private physician Dr. J.D., in March 2014, which noted that the Veteran had limited range of motion of the left knee, however the joint stability testing for the left knee was reported as normal upon examination. 

Thus, in the September 2014, the AOJ again denied service connection finding that the evidence submitted was not new and material.  

On March 23, 2015, the Veteran initiated a claim, which was finalized on April 2, 2015, to reopen his preciously denied claim for service connection for a left knee disorder. In July 2015, the AOJ again denied service connection for a left knee disorder finding that the evidence submitted was not new and material. 

Later that same month, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 21-0958), claiming entitlement to service connection for a left knee disorder. In an April 2020 Board decision, the Board found that new and material evidence had been received, thus the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disorder was reopened and service connection was granted. 

Pursuant to the Board decision, the Veteran underwent a VA examination on January 4, 2021, at which time a diagnosis of left knee strain with instability was rendered. In this regard, joint stability testing reflected that the Veteran had slight lateral instability at 1+ (0-5 millimeters). 

In a January 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for left knee instability with a 10 percent evaluation effective March 23, 2015. 

In May 2021, the Veteran filed a Request for Higher-Level Review, (VA Form 20-0996), claiming entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent and an effective date prior to March 23, 2015, for left knee instability. Pursuant to the Veteran's request for a higher-level review, in a July 2021, rating decision the AOJ found that a clear and unmistakable error was found in the effective date assigned for service connection for left knee instability and therefore, a later effective date of January 4, 2021, the date of the VA examination first diagnosing left knee instability, was proposed. 

In this regard, the November 2021, rating decision found that a clear and unmistakable error was found in the effective date assigned for service connection for left knee instability, and therefore, the effective date of January 4, 2021, was granted. In October 2022, the Veteran filed a Request for Higher-Level Review, (VA Form 20-0996), claiming entitlement to an effective date of March 23, 2015, for service connection for the Veteran's left knee instability.  Pursuant to the Veteran's request for a higher-level review, in the January 2023, rating decision the AOJ found that entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for left knee instability was denied. 

Consequently, based on the foregoing, the Board finds that an effective date prior to January 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for left knee instability is not warranted. The Board finds that January 4, 2021, is the first date such disability was factually ascertainable and entitlement to compensation arose. In this regard, the Board observes that, the January 2012 VA knee examination, reflected the Veteran's report of knee pain; however, instability testing was normal. Furthermore, it was reported that the Veteran's left knee disorder did not impact his ability to work, as he was able to work 40 hours a week at the Army Depot for 10-hour shifts, walking 6 12 hours despite his pain. Furthermore, he reported he was able to wash dishes, take out the trash, and push a lawnmower without difficulty. Similarly, the October 2012 VA knee examination reflected that the Veteran reported knee pain, but instability testing was normal. It was further noted that the Veteran's knee disorder impacted his ability to work as his job as an environmental specialist at the Army Depot required him to be on his feet the majority of the day but that he was able to do all activities of daily living, chores, and use the treadmill and elliptical trainer. Additionally, the Veteran provided a private disability benefits questionnaire, completed by Dr. J.D. in March 2014, which reflected that the Veteran reported knee pain which impacted his ability to work in that he was unable to stand or walk well without his cane; however, there was no evidence of left knee instability on joint stability testing. Additionally, VA and private treatment records were reviewed and do not contain a reasonably ascertainable diagnosis or complaints of left knee instability.

Consequently, based on the foregoing, the Board finds that, while the Veteran's separate rating for left knee instability stems from his March 23, 2015, claim for service connection for a left knee disorder, entitlement to such separate rating did not arise until January 4, 2021, the date such became factually ascertainable as demonstrated at a VA examination conducted on such date. Notably, the January 2021 examination report reflects knee instability diagnosed as of January 4, 2021. Thus, the proper effective date for the award of the separate rating for left knee instability is January 4, 2021, and the Veteran's appeal must be denied.

In reaching such decision, the Board has considered the benefit of the doubt doctrine; however, as the weight of the probative evidence is against the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for left knee instability, such is inapplicable in the instant appeal and his claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Consequently, based on the foregoing, the Board finds that an effective date prior to January 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for left knee instability is not warranted. In this regard, there is no doubt to be resolved and such claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.
