FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran separated from service on November 9, 2022.

2. On June 8, 2023, within a year of his separation from service, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for Compensation Benefits, which included a claim for service connection for scrotal pain.  

3. The Veteran is in receipt of the highest rating allowed by law for erectile dysfunction with or without a penile deformity.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

2.  The criteria for an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.74.115b, Diagnostic Code 7522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2013 to November 2022.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024.  In pertinent part, the decision granted service connection for erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain and assigned an initial noncompensable (0 percent) disability rating, effective November 10, 2022.  This constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran disagreed with the initial rating and effective date assigned for his service-connected erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain.  He elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain

The Veteran has been assigned an effective date of November 10, 2022, for his award of service connection for erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain.  The Veteran disagrees with that effective date; however, neither he nor his representative have offered any arguments as to why they believe an earlier effective date is warranted.

The law and regulations governing effective dates establish that, unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim, or a supplemental claim, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  

The effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran shall be the day following the date of the veteran's discharge or release if application therefore is received within one year from such date of discharge or release.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1).  

These statutory provisions are implemented by 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, which states that an effective date will be assigned from the day following separation from active service or date entitlement arose if claim is received within 1 year after separation from service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Separation from service means separation under conditions other than dishonorable from continuous active service which extended from the date the disability was incurred or aggravated.

In this case, a review of the claims files shows that the Veteran separated from active duty service on November 9, 2022.  He initially claimed compensation for scrotal pain on June 8, 2023, within one year of his separation from service.

In accordance with the regulations applicable to effective dates for compensation benefits, an effective date of November 10, 2022, was assigned.  This is the day following the Veteran's date of separation from service and the earliest effective date possible for the Veteran's award of service connection for erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1).  Accordingly, the Board finds that an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain is not warranted and the appeal is denied.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the veteran, as well as the entire history of the veteran's disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

In deciding this appeal, the Board has considered whether separate ratings for different periods of time, based on the facts found, are warranted, a practice of assigning ratings referred to as "staging the ratings." See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

2.  Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for service-connected erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain 

The Veteran first filed a claim for scrotal pain in June 2023.  In February 2024, the Veteran was granted service connection for his diagnosed erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain.  He was assigned a noncompensable rating, and the Veteran contends he is entitled to a compensable rating.  See September 2024 VA Form 10182.

During the entire appeal period, the Veteran's erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain has been rated at a noncompensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7522, which rates erectile dysfunction under the General Rating Formula for the Genitourinary System.  Under the General Rating Formula for the Genitourinary System, erectile dysfunction, with or without a penial deformity, can only be assigned a zero percent, noncompensable rating.  

In February 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA examination to evaluate his claim for scrotal pain.  Erectile dysfunction, with or without penile deformity, and scrotal pain were diagnosed.  The Veteran reported a decreased sexual drive following an incident in service where he was hit in the scrotum by another soldier.  He also reported pain at times after sexual intercourse in the scrotum, and about five months earlier, having blood in his urine after a physical fitness test.  His current symptoms were reported as pain in the scrotum after sexual intercourse and occasional blood in urine.  The Veteran did not use any medication for his diagnosed condition, and he had not had an orchiectomy.  On physical examination, the Veteran was not found to have any renal or voiding dysfunction related to the diagnosed condition.  The Veteran did have erectile dysfunction, but no retrograde ejaculation or history of chronic prostatitis, urethritis, epididymitis, orchitis, or urinary tract infections.  The Veteran declined a physical examination, but reported to the examiner that he had normal anatomy with no penile or testicular deformity or abnormality.  Finally, the examiner noted no functional impact from the diagnosed condition.

The record does not include any VA or private treatment records for the period at issue.

While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that a compensable disability rating is warranted, after reviewing the foregoing evidence, the Board concludes that for the entire period on appeal the Veteran's erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain has been rated at the highest schedular evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7522.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115b.  The Veteran's decreased sexual drive, and scrotal pain with occasional blood in his urine is contemplated by the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain.  Additionally, consideration of a higher rating under an alternative diagnostic code under the General Rating Formula for the Genitourinary System would require evidence of penis removal, complete atrophy of both testes, or removal of both testes, which has not been shown.  Id.  Thus, the claim must be denied. 

In denying this claim, the Board does note that although a compensable rating for his service-connected erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain has been denied, the Veteran has been separately granted entitlement to special monthly compensation based on the loss of use of a creative organ, effective from November 10, 2022. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a).  Accordingly, the Veteran is in receipt of monetary compensation for his erectile dysfunction with scrotal pain.
