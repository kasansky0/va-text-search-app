DOCKET NO. 200925-351818
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for accrued benefits is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In May 2024, the appellant, the Veteran's daughter, died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), and the appellant's representative has requested to withdraw this appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the appellant and request to withdraw this appeal, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.205, 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service from October 1942 to December 1945.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b) and 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).

The Veteran died in October 2011. His surviving spouse, D., filed for dependency and indemnity compensation in August 2016. A Regional Office of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) issued a Rating Decision in April 2017 awarding the surviving spouse, D., aid and attendance. 

The surviving spouse, D., died in January 2018. The Veteran and D.'s daughter, J., filed a request for entitlement to any accrued benefits due and owing to her mother, D. The VA Regional Office denied the claim in September 2020. The appellant, J., filed VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) on September 25, 2020. 

Unfortunately, the appellant, J., died in May 2024, during the pendency of this appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim(s) at this time and must dismiss this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The appellant's representative contacted VA on June 3, 2024, and requested withdrawal of this appeal, it appearing that no substitute claimants exist. June 3, 2024, VA Form 27-0820 (Repot of General Information). An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. The Board finds the requirements for dismissal are met on this basis, in addition to the basis identified in the preceding paragraph.

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the appellant's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim(s). This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the appellant's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). 

In this case, no one has requested to substitute for the appellant. Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant." The form and filing instructions are available online at https://www.va.gov/find-forms/. If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the appellant's death and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

In the present case, the appellant is deceased, and her representative has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
