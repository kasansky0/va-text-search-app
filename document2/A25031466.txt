REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1982 to October 1986. These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from decisions rendered in December 2020. The Appellant is a non-VA provider.

The Appellant filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal in December 2020 and selected the Evidence Submission docket.

The record indicates that these claims were originally denied on the basis that the episodes of care in question were not pre-authorized. However, on secondary review, an authorization was found. A Report of Contact confirms that these claims were resurrected for processing. 

(continued on next page)?

The administrative action approving payment for the treatment in question constitutes a complete grant of the benefits sought. As a result, no determination remains with which the Appellant disagrees, and the appeal is dismissed. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(d); 38?C.F.R. §?20.801(b).
