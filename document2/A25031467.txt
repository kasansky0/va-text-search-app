REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for meningioma (claimed as headaches) is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for chronic migraine headaches is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from September 1996 to February 2003.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after that cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for meningioma is remanded.

The issue raised by the evidence is whether the Veteran has a current disability that is related to his service in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War period. However, the Board finds that the evidence of record is insufficient to make a fully-informed decision on the issue.

The Board concludes that remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error and to obtain an adequate VA examination.

Exposure to certain identified substances, chemicals, and airborne hazards during the service of the covered veteran is presumed, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that they were not expose to any such substances, chemicals, or hazards in connection with such service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1119. A December 2022 VA memorandum indicates that the Veteran had qualifying service under section 1119 of the PACT Act. Therefore, he is considered a covered Veteran. See 38 U.S.C. § 1119(c)(1)(A).

VA has recognized a presumptive association between burn pit and other toxin (BPOT) exposures and brain cancer (Diagnostic Code 8002), gastrointestinal cancer (Diagnostic Code 7343), glioblastoma (Diagnostic Code 8002), kidney cancer (Diagnostic Code 7528), lymphoma cancer (Diagnostic Codes 7709 and 7715), head cancer (Diagnostic Codes 5012, 5329, 6014 (excluding skin), 6208, 7123, 7712, 7818, 8540 (neurogenic origin), and 9918), melanoma (Diagnostic Code 7833), neck cancer (Diagnostic Codes 5012, 5328, 6819, 7123, 7712, 7818, 7914, 8021, and 8540 (neurogenic origin)), reproductive cancer (Diagnostic Codes 7627, 7630, and 7709), respiratory cancer (Diagnostic Code 6819), and pancreatic cancer (Diagnostic Code 7343). See 38 U.S.C. § 1120.  

This list of cancers is from 38 U.S.C. § 1120, however, the diagnostic codes listed are from the sub-regulatory guidance. VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 22-24. The sub-regulatory guidance directs that VA interpret the definition for the presumptive cancers and granulomatous disease in a broad and inclusive manner. Id. Further, only malignant tumors are presumed to be due to BPOT exposures. However, benign neoplasms and other non-malignant diseases are not. Id. 

As pertinent here, a July 2023 VA primary care note shows where the Veteran was seen with complaints of headaches 4-5 times a week and dizziness. Consequently, he received an October 2023 VA neurology consult, which noted the following: 

There is a small focus of calcification in the midline posterior region that looked like it might have had a dural tail, so meningioma is considered.

See October 2023 VA Neurology Consult.

Although the Veteran has claimed entitlement to service connection for chronic migraine headaches, a claimant is not required in filing a claim for benefits to identify a precise medical diagnosis or the medical cause of his condition; rather, he sufficiently files a claim for benefits "by referring to a body part or system that is disabled or by describing symptoms of the disability." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 86 (2009).

Headaches are a common symptom of brain tumors. Meningiomas are classified in three grades. Grade III meningiomas are malignant tumors that can cause headaches due to their aggressive growth and potential to increase intracranial pressure or invade pain-sensitive structures. See National Inst. of Neurological Disorders & Stroke, Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors, U.S. Dept. of Health & Hum. Servs., https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/brain-and-spinal-cord-tumors (last visited Apr. 2, 2025).

The issue therefore becomes whether the Veteran's headaches are related to a current diagnosis of meningioma. If so, the issue becomes whether the Veteran's meningioma is a type of cancer that meets the criteria for presumptive service connection due to BPOT exposure. However, to date, VA has not afforded the Veteran a VA central nervous system and neuromuscular diseases examination to determine whether he has a current diagnosis of meningioma (claimed as headaches). The absence of such amounts to a pre-decisional duty to assist error that must be corrected. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

To this end, the issue is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for chronic migraine headaches is remanded.

As the service-connection claim for headaches is inextricably intertwined with the foregoing claim, it must be remanded as well. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for meningioma (claimed as headaches). The examiner must review the claims file and provide a response to the following:

(a.) Does the Veteran have a current diagnosis of meningioma?

(b.) If so, the examiner is asked to provide an opinion as to whether it is considered to be a cancer pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1120. Attention is also directed to VBA Letter 20-22-10.
