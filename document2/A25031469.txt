DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 23, 2022, for service connection for the Veteran's cause of death and dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) is denied.  

FINDING OF FACT

The Appellant filed her Intent to File a Claim for Benefits on August 23, 2022.

The Appellant filed her claim for service connection for the Veteran's cause of death and DIC on September 26, 2022. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the award of an effective date earlier than August 23, 2022, for service connection for the Veteran's cause of death and DIC have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155(b), 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1951 to June 1955. He died December 1, 2016, and the Appellant is his widow.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Appellant or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

This appeal is advanced on the docket on account of the Appellant's advanced age. 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2). 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c).

The Board notes that the December 2024 Notice of Disagreement states the Appellant disagrees with the August 23, 2022, effective date for DIC benefits which was assigned by the AOJ in a December 18, 2023 AMA Notification Letter. While a December 2023 Board decision granted service connection for the Veteran's cause of death, no effective date was assigned by the Board. As the AOJ assigned the August 23, 2022 effective date in the first instance, the issue is properly before the Board.

Earlier Effective Date

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim or a supplemental claim shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a). If a claim for service-connected death is received within one year of the Veteran's death, the effective date will be the first day of the month in which the Veteran's death occurred; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (c)(2). If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in paragraph (a) of § 3.160, appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b)(1).

The Appellant contends that her claim for service connection for the Veteran's cause of death and DIC benefits should be considered a downstream or inextricably intertwined issue with her accrued benefits claim for service connection for parasomnia. See December 2024 Statement in Support of Claim.

By way of history, the Veteran died December 1, 2016. The Appellant applied for substitution in December 2016 and filed a claim for a death pension and accrued benefits in January 2017. In February 2017 substitution was granted. In March 2017 the Appellant's claim for a death pension was granted.  In a July 2017 AOJ decision, the Appellant was granted aid and attendance from May 26, 2017.

At the time of the Veteran's death, he was seeking service connection for cold weather injury to his feet, tonsillitis, and a psychiatric disability. After being granted substitution, the Appellant vigorously pursued these claims. Subsequently, 4 Board decisions which denied service connection for a psychiatric disability resulted in 4 remands by the Court of Appeals Veterans Claims (CAVC). In an August 2022 Board decision service connection for parasomnia was granted. The Appellant filed her Intent to File a Claim for Benefits in August 2022. In September 2022 the Appellant submitted a claim for service connection for the Veteran's cause of death and DIC. A December 2022 AOJ decision denied the claims. In August 2023 the Appellant submitted a Notice of Disagreement requesting the evidence review docket. A December 2023 Board decision granted service connection for the Veteran's cause of death and DIC. The December 18, 2023 decision on appeal established an effective date of August 23, 2022, the date of the Appellant's Intent to File a Claim was received by VA. 

Analysis

Considering the record in light of the governing legal authority, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than August 23, 2022, is not assignable for service connection for the Veteran's cause of the death and DIC claims.  

To warrant an earlier effective than August 23, 2022, there must be an application, statement, or any other submission indicating the Appellant's intent to apply for compensation for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death and DIC prior to August 23, 2022.  The record does not show that the Appellant filed an application, statement, or any submission that suggested her intent to apply for compensation for the cause of the Veteran's death and DIC prior to that date.

The Board acknowledges that the Appellant submitted a January 2017 VA 21-534EZ Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation or Death Pension by a Surviving Spouse or Child. Generally, a claim submitted for DIC is considered a claim to entitlement to all eligible death benefits, unless as is the case here, the claims were specifically limited by the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 3.152(b). The Appellant specifically limited the claims to a death pension and accrued benefits. The Appellant's claim for a death pension and accrued benefits was granted in a March 2017 decision which was not appealed and has since become final. Clear and unmistakable error has not been raised in this instance.

The Appellant's argument that her claim for DIC should be considered a downstream or inextricably intertwined issue with her accrued benefits claim for service connection for parasomnia if applied would result in an effective date of August 13, 2014, well before the Veteran's death. The Board acknowledges the logic in Appellant's argument that the effective date of the Veteran's cause of death and associated DIC benefits should be the date of his death. However, the Board is precluded from assigning an earlier effective date by the governing legal authority.

The Board also considered liberalizing laws which could allow a retroactive effective date for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death. However, the Veteran's cause of death was attributed to his service-connected parasomnia, a psychiatric disability, caused by his wartime service in Korea. At this time there is not a liberalizing law or regulation which would allow an earlier effective date for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death due to a psychiatric disability which was based on service in Korea in 1953. 

The Board is sympathetic to the Appellant and regrets that a more favorable decision cannot be reached in this matter. However, the applicable laws and regulations do not provide for the provision of retroactive DIC benefits prior to the assigned date. Thus, the Appellant's claim for an effective date earlier than August 23, 2022, for the grant of DIC benefits based on service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death must be denied.
