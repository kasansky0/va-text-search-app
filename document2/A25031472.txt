FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's original claim of service connection for hemorrhoids and herpes was received by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in May 2007, the same month as the Veteran's May 16, 2007, discharge from service.

2. Service connection for hemorrhoids and herpes was denied in a December 2007 VA Administrative Decision based on a finding that the Veteran's discharge from was under dishonorable conditions and was thus a bar to benefits; VA reconsidered this decision in October 2023 based on the receipt of new service department records and found that, due to insanity, the discharge should be considered to be other than dishonorable.

3. Service connection for hemorrhoids and herpes was awarded in a December 2023 decision based solely on the change in characterization by VA of the Veteran's discharge from service.

4. The first document in the claims file indicating an intent to file a claim for IBS, bilateral foot strain, tinnitus, migraines, and/or an acquired psychiatric disorder was an Intent to File received by VA on February 4, 2021, followed by a complete application received the same month. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of May 17, 2007, for the award of service connection for hemorrhoids and herpes are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than February 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for IBS, bilateral foot strain, tinnitus, migraines, and PTSD with MDD and schizophrenia are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 2003 to May 2007. In October 2023, the VA determined that the discharge for this period of service was other than dishonorable for VA purposes and basic eligibility to all VA benefits was established.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 decision by a VA regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Dates

The Veteran asserts that he should be afforded an effective date of May 17, 2007, for the award of service connection for each of the disabilities addressed herein. 

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim for compensation benefits shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). 

When an award is based on a petition to reopen a previously denied claim, the effective date is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless new and material evidence was received within the relevant appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q). 

When a claim is received within one year from the date of discharge or release from service, the effective date of an award for disability compensation to a Veteran shall be the day following the date of discharge or release. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2); see also Wright v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 343, 346-48 (1997).

Finally, a claimant may indicate their desire to file a claim by submitting an Intent to File to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). If VA receives a complete claim within one year of receipt of the Intent to File, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the Intent to File was received. Id. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for hemorrhoids.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for herpes.

The Veteran filed his original claims for service connection for hemorrhoids and herpes in May 2007, the same month he was discharged from service. 05/21/2007 VA 21-526. A December 2007 VA administrative decision determined that the Veteran's discharge, under other than honorable conditions, was considered a bar to the payment of VA benefits. 12/06/2007 Administrative Decision. It listed as evidence the Veteran's service connection claim, his Form DD 214, the due process letter sent to the Veteran, and a response received from the Veteran. Id. The decision explained that attempts to retrieve information regarding the facts and circumstances of the Veteran's discharge from the service department were met only with copies of the Veteran's agreement to extend enlistment. The Veteran again submitted a claim for these disabilities in August 2012; in November 2012, he was again informed that his discharge was a bar to the receipt of VA benefits. 11/09/2012 Notification Letter.

On February 4, 2021, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File, followed by a claim for service connection for multiple disabilities, including hemorrhoids and herpes, the same month. 02/04/2021 Notification Letter; 02/24/2021 VA 21-526EZ. In October 2021, the Veteran was awarded service connection for treatment purposes only for each of the claimed disabilities, but the AOJ again determined that his character of discharge was a bar to the payment of disability compensation. The Veteran appealed this determination to the Board.

In May 2023, the Board remanded the issue of the character of discharge to determine if the Veteran was insane at the time he committed the acts upon which his character of discharge was based, specifically finding that, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), new and relevant service department records had been added to the record in May 2021 which necessitated the reconsideration of the original decision on this matter. In October 2023, following the Board remand, the AOJ issued a rating decision and administrative decision finding that the Veteran was insane during the period at issue, and that his period of service is considered honorable for VA purposes such that eligibility for all benefits administered by the VA was established. 10/26/2023 Administrative Decision. In December 2023, the AOJ granted service connection for each of the claimed disabilities, including hemorrhoids and herpes, and assigned an effective date of February 4, 2021, in conjunction with the date of receipt of the Intent to File.

As noted above, when a previous decision has become final, the earliest effective date of service connection generally is the date of the petition to reopen rather than the date of the original claim. One exception to this rule includes a later grant of service connection based in whole or in part on relevant service department records that existed at the time of the prior denial but were not associated with the claims file as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), VA must reconsider a claim if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1). "To be relevant, a record must address a dispositive issue and therefore affect the outcome of the case. [T]he record must speak to a matter in issue, in other words, a matter in dispute." Kisor v. Wilkie, 969 F.3d 1333, 1338-1339 (Fed. Cir. 2020). If an award of benefits results even "in part" because of such records, the effective date is "the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later, or such other date as may be authorized by the provisions of this part applicable to the previously decided claim." Id. § 3.156(c)(3). The point of these provisions is to put the Veteran in the position he would have been had VA obtained and considered relevant service department records before adjudicating his earlier claims. See Blubaugh v. McDonald, 773 F.3d 1310, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2014). 

The AOJ finalized VA's determination on the Veteran's character of discharge in the administrative decision in October 2023, which found the Veteran's service from to be under honorable conditions for VA purposes, and subsequently granted service connection for hemorrhoids and herpes. Notably, service treatment records reflect diagnoses of these disabilities during active service. 05/21/2007 STR - Medical. The Board finds that the parameters of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), covering the consideration of then existing service records that were not in the claims file during an earlier denial, allow the Veteran to obtain an earlier effective date. The prior May 2007 denial of his claims of service connection for hemorrhoids and herpes was based upon an incomplete review of his personnel record, and the determination as to the character of discharge was dispositive to the Veteran's claims. The Board finds the personnel records received in May 2021 were relevant to the issue of the Veteran's character of discharge and were not considered by the prior denial as they were not of record at that time. As these newly received records addressed a dispositive issue, and thus impacted the outcome of the case, the Board finds them to be relevant.

As noted further in 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3), as the claims were granted because of the newly received personnel records, the effective date then becomes the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later. In this instance, the Veteran filed his initial claim in May 2007, the same month he was discharged from service. The record reflects that the disabilities were present in service. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i), the effective date for a grant of direct service connection is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Here, the Veteran separated from service on May 16, 2007, so the earliest possible effective date is May 17, 2007.

Accordingly, as the initial denial was made without all relevant service department records, and the Veteran filed his claims within one year of separation from active duty, the proper effective date for the Veteran's claims for service connection for hemorrhoids and herpes is the day following his separation from active service, May 17, 2007.

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for IBS. 

4. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for right foot strain.

5. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for left foot strain.

6. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for tinnitus.

7. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for migraines.

8. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 4, 2021, for the award of service connection for PTSD with MDD and schizophrenia.

The Veteran advances the same arguments regarding the remaining claims as for the claims for an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for hemorrhoids and herpes; that is, he contends that he should be awarded an effective date of May 17, 2007. 06/03/2024 VA Form 10182.

The difference between these remaining claims and the claims discussed above is that the first time the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for IBS, bilateral foot strain, tinnitus, migraines, and an acquired psychiatric disorder was in February 2021, after the filing of the February 4, 2021, Intent to File. 02/04/2021 Notification Letter; 02/24/2021 VA 21-526EZ. The original May 2007 service connection claim was only for hemorrhoids and herpes. 

As discussed in detail above, when an original claim is filed, the proper effective date is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. When a complete claim is filed within one year of the receipt by VA of an Intent to File, the claim will be considered to have been received on the date of receipt of the Intent to File. Unlike the claims of service connection for hemorrhoids and herpes, the Veteran did not file a claim for the remaining disabilities within the one year following service. Further, while the award of service connection for these remaining disabilities was, in part, dependent on the finding, based on the receipt of new service department records, that the Veteran's discharge was under other than dishonorable conditions, there were no earlier decisions to reconsider with respect to these claims. As such, 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) is not applicable.

There is no document in the claims file dated earlier than February 4, 2021, that can be considered a claim for any of these disabilities. As such, the Board finds the currently assigned effective date is proper. As the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that an effective date earlier than February 4, 2021, is warranted for the awards of service connection for IBS, bilateral foot strain, tinnitus, migraines, and PTSD with MDD and schizophrenia, there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor and the claims are denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
