DOCKET NO. 240531-444853
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

The claim as to whether reduction of the 70 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive disorder to 50 percent was proper is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On June 21, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2024 and in a May 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option.

Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  An appeal withdrawal is effective when received by the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (b)(3).

In a statement received June 21, 2024, the Veteran, indicated that he wished to withdraw the appeal for PTSD.  See June 2024 Statement.

A written withdrawal must include the name of the appellant, the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205; Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1,5 (2020).  In the present case, the aforementioned criteria has been satisfied, where the June 2024 written statement from the appellant, includes the Veteran's name, claims file number, and a request to withdraw his appeal.  Importantly, the withdrawal was effective immediately upon receipt by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (b)(3).

Accordingly, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review this appeal, and it is dismissed.
