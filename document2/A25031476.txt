REMANDED

An initial rating in excess of 30 percent for coronary artery disease (CAD) is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Navy from February 1971 to January 1976, including service in Guam. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

As a final preliminary matter, the Board is cognizant of the ruling of the Court in Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  In the present case, the Veteran has not specifically argued, and the record does not otherwise reflect, that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities render the Veteran unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that a claim for a total disability rating has not been raised.  The Veteran certainly may raise this claim in the future, should the Veteran choose to do so. 

An initial rating in excess of 30 percent for CAD is granted. 

The Veteran seeks, generally, a higher disability rating for his service-connected coronary artery disease.  The Veteran's coronary artery disease is currently rated at 30 percent disabling, effective August 10, 2022, under Diagnostic Code 7005. 

After a review of the record, the Board determines that a remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error, as the medical opinion of record is inadequate to adjudicate the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

In a January 2024 VA examination, the VA examiner noted the Veteran's diagnosis of arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease), with stable angina and stent, as well as a heart valve condition and reported that the Veteran underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention in June 2017.  The examiner further noted that the Veteran requires three different continuous medications for his heart disability. 

During the examination, the examiner performed interview-based METs testing.  Based on the Veteran's reports of angina and breathlessness, the examiner found that the Veteran's heart symptoms result in a METs level between 5 and 7, which is found to be consistent with activities such as walking one flight of stairs, golfing (without a cart), mowing lawn (push mower), and heavy yard work (digging).  The examiner stated that the Veteran's heart condition caused functional impairment, as the Veteran reported shortness of breath and chest pain from walking up one flight of stairs and mowing the lawn. 

The Veteran submitted private treatment records from 2017 through 2023.  The treatment records document that, after the Veteran underwent a coronary angiography with two stents, the Veteran continued to experience chest pain and shortness of breath.  In a January 2022 treatment note, the Veteran complained of dizziness (when using the restroom), fatigue, and chest tightness (pressure when doing anything physical).  Additionally, in two separate April 2022 treatment notes, the Veteran again complained of chest pressure and shortness of breath, stating that it is affecting his daily living.  He reported that carrying light suitcases on one occasion and carrying just two folding chairs on another occasion forced him to stop walking so that he could breathe.  

The Board notes that a medical opinion is only adequate "where it is based upon consideration of the veteran's prior medical history and examinations."  Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007) (quoting Ardison v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 405, 407 (1994)).  And while an examiner is not required to consider every piece of favorable evidence, the examiner must rely on an accurate factual history.  Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 105-106 (2012), overruled on other grounds by Euzebio v. McDonough, 989 F.3d 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ardison, 6 Vet.App. at 407. 

Further, the Board may reject a medical opinion because other facts present in the record contradict the facts provided by the Veteran that formed the basis for the opinion.  See Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229, 233 (1993). 

Here, the examiner did not acknowledge or discuss the Veteran's pertinent medical history, rendering the VA examination report inadequate for rating purposes.  Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 123.  Additionally, the Board finds that the Veteran's private medical records contradict the facts presented in the January 2024 VA examination, reflecting that the Veteran experienced additional symptoms to what was noted during the examination.  As such, the Board finds that the January 2024 VA examination is inadequate and that a new examination must be obtained to determine the current severity of the Veteran's heart disability. 

The appeal is remanded for a VA examination that takes into consideration the Veteran's full and accurate medical history.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Afford the Veteran a new VA examination to assess the current severity and impact of his heart disability. 

The examiner should provide a full description of the Veteran's heart disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary to evaluate the Veteran's disability.

In doing so, the examiner must specifically acknowledge and discuss the Veteran's medical history and competent lay reports regarding the severity of his coronary artery disease and related heart conditions.
