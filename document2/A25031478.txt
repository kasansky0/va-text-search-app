DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is persuasively weighted towards finding that the Veteran's prostate cancer is related to his toxic exposures during service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for prostate cancer have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1131, 5107(b) (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1955 to October 1958. 

This matter was appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2024 rating decision through submission of an August 2024 VA Form 10182 with election of the hearing appeal docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran within 90 days following the date of the November 8, 2024 hearing withdrawal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(c). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date of the scheduled Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the date of the scheduled hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(c), 20.801. 

Service connection for prostate cancer 

Legal Criteria 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. Id.; see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

Factual Background & Analysis 

The Veteran's contention is that service connection is warranted for prostate cancer as a result of his toxic exposures while performing the duties associated with his Military Occupational Specialty as a Seaman. The May 2024 Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) memorandum notes potential exposures as industrial solvents, lead, fuels, adhesives, cleaning compounds and solvents, sealants, weapon cleaning oils and lubricants (Acetone, Carbon dioxide, Heptane, Toluene, Methanol, 3-Methylhexane, Methylcyclohexane, Naphtha, Cyclohexane, and Ethylbenzene). In a March 2024 statement the Veteran also communicated that he was exposed to asbestos while serving aboard the USS Ticonderoga. 

The Board recognizes and incorporates the favorable finding made by the AOJ in the August 2024 rating decision that the Veteran has a current disability of prostate cancer. 

In February 2025 a medical opinion was received from a physician Dr. K.G., MD. The clinician indicated that they reviewed the entire claims file and included an annotated list of the evidence in their report. They opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran was exposed to sufficient levels of toxic chemicals and hazardous substances such as asbestos to have a "deleterious health impact." They noted that the Veteran was exposed to asbestos, PAHs and military grade solvent all of which have carcinogenic properties and are "well-documented to have a causal link with prostate cancer." The examiner opined that it is at least as likely s not that the Veteran's prostate cancer was incurred in our caused by his exposure to hazardous chemicals and asbestos during his service. They cited to multiple studies from government and medical institutions to support their conclusion.

The Board finds that this positive nexus opinion is sufficient to establish the elements of service connection for prostate cancer. The physician who provided the February 2025 medical opinion provided a definitive nexus opinion using the correct standard of proof with an adequate supporting rationale, and there is no indication that they were not fully aware of the Veteran's past medical history or misstated any relevant fact in providing their opinions. See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-49 (2000); see also Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-04 (2008) (holding that the probative value of a medical opinion comes from the "factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion"). Moreover, the toxic exposures linked to the Veteran's prostate cancer are consistent with those found to be concomitant with the circumstances of his service by the May 2024 TERA memorandum. Considering the above competent medical evidence, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for prostate cancer and this decision represents a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal.
