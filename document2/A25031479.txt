DOCKET NO. 241027-482095
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for eligibility for benefits under VA's Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran and his caregiver-spouse were co-applicants for benefits under VA's PCAFC.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the co-applicant, the criteria for dismissal of the appeal are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1720G, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 71.10, 71.25, 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The first party to the matter is the Veteran, who served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1968 to November 1969, November 1990 to September 1991, and June 2004 to October 2005. He was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal and Iraq Campaign Medal, among other decorations, for this service.  The second party to the matter was his caregiver-spouse, who applied to be the Primary Family Caregiver.

In an October 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), the appellants elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction and any evidence submitted within 90 days of the VA Form 10182 (January 25, 2025). 38C.F.R. 

§ 20.301.

Eligibility for Benefits under VA's PCAFC.

In this case, the Veteran and his spouse, the co-applicant, applied for PCAFC benefits in October 2023. The application was denied in an October 2024 VHA decision.  The Board received notice, through the Veteran's representative, that the Veteran's caregiver-spouse and co-applicant for benefits died in January 2025.

As an initial matter, the Board expresses its condolences to the Veteran for his loss.

The PCAFC, among other things, provides certain benefits to eligible veterans who have incurred or aggravated serious injuries during military service, and to their caregivers. 38 U.S.C. § 1720(G); 38 C.F.R. § 71.10(a).

Generally, when an appellant dies, a case is dismissed under 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302. In this matter, the Veteran is not deceased and was the Veteran upon whose service this application was based. Therefore, dismissal is not proper under 38 C.F.R. 

§ 20.1302. Here, the death of the co-applicant, who was applying to be the Primary Family Caregiver, however, extinguishes the appeal.

A PCAFC application requires a joint application from both parties, the Veteran and the individual wishing to be the Primary Family Caregiver.  See 38 C.F.R. 

§ 71.25(a)(1). Moreover, in order to be designated and approved as a Primary Family Caregiver, that individual must complete all assessment, education, and training requirements. See 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(c).  Finally, approval and designation of a Primary Family Caregiver is conditioned on both the Veteran and the co-applicant remaining eligible, including the Family Caregiver providing personal care services to the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(f).  While the Board is sympathetic, the death of the Veteran's caregiver-spouse and co-applicant for benefits makes fulfillment of the statutory requirements for PCAFC participation impossible and the claim must be dismissed.

The Board again expresses its condolences to the Veteran for his loss, but as a matter of law, the appeal must be dismissed for no case on controversy. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104. The Board further advises that if the Veteran wishes to be considered for PCAFC eligibility he may file a new PCAFC application for consideration.
