ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for constipation, as secondary to service connected lumbar degenerative disc disease, is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbar degenerative disc disease prior to April 29, 2021, is remanded.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar degenerative disc disease from April 29, 2021, and continuing, is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's constipation is due to his service connected spine condition.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for constipation, as secondary to service-connected lumbar degenerative disc disease, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from August 1954 to August 1958, and the U.S. Air Force from September 1958 to December 1974.  This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. 

Unfortunately, the Veteran died in March 2023.  The appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse and has been accepted as substitute for purposes of the Veteran's claims pending at the time of his death.  See July 2023 Notification Letter.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket, and the appellant did not request a docket switch.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the implied claim for service connection for constipation, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims for increased disability ratings for lumbar degenerative disc disease prior to April 29, 2021, and thereafter, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that the Veteran's March 2023 request for higher-level review characterized the Veteran's claim as one for an earlier effective date for the 40 percent spine disability rating.  See March 2023 VA Form 20-0996.  However, as made clear by the March 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran was not seeking an earlier effective date.  Rather, he was seeking an increased rating during all stages of the appeal period.  See Argument in Support of the March 2024 VA Form 10182.  Thus, the Board has characterized the appellant's claims as those for increased ratings.

Additionally, consistent with the Board's duty to maximize benefits when presented with an increased rating appeal, the Board has raised entitlement to service connection for constipation, as secondary to the Veteran's service connected spine disability.  See Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162 (2019) (noting VA's duty to maximize benefits requires it to first exhaust all schedular alternatives for rating a disability that are expressly or reasonably raised by the record including, but not limited to, secondary service connection); Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021) (holding that when entitlement to service connection on a secondary basis is raised during the appeal of the rating assigned for the underlying primary disability, the claimant need not file a separate, formal claim for secondary service connection).  

The Veteran's lumbar spine disability is currently rated under Diagnostic Code 5242 for degenerative arthritis, which is rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  Note 1 requires a separate rating for any associated neurologic abnormalities, including bowel or bladder impairment.  Because the Veteran does not currently have a separate rating for his bowel impairment and the evidence of record shows an associated bowel abnormality, entitlement to service connection for constipation has been added as an issue on appeal.

1. Entitlement to service connection for constipation, as secondary to service connected lumbar degenerative disc disease

The late Veteran explained that his back pain caused difficulty moving his bowels and frequent constipation.  See May 11, 2020 Statement in Support of Claim.  The appellant verified the Veteran's back pain with difficulty moving his bowels.  See May 13, 2020 Statement in Support of Claim.  Because the Veteran's constipation is due to his service-connected lumbar spine disability, entitlement to service connection is warranted.

A Veteran is entitled to VA disability compensation for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service.  38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a claimant must show: (1) a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, referred to as the "nexus" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

However, a claimant can also establish service connection on a secondary basis.  Secondary service connection may be established for a disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires (1) a current disability not already service-connected; (2) at least one service-connected disability; and (3) evidence that the nonservice-connected disability either is (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by (has any incremental increase in severity due to) a service-connected disability.  See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc); Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th. 1360, 1363-65 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant.  Lynch, 21 F.4th, at 780-81.

By way of background, during an April 2021 VA examination for intestinal conditions, the Veteran was diagnosed with "[c]onstipation associated with lumbar degenerative disc disease."  The Veteran described constipation for several years due to back pain and stated that it had progressed since onset.

The April 2021 VA examination supports the grant of secondary service connection.  The Veteran had a current diagnosis of constipation, satisfying element one of service connection.  He was service connected for lumbar degenerative disc disease, in satisfaction of the second element.  Last, the April 2021 VA examination report indicates that constipation was a symptom of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability, and thus that constipation was caused by service connected lumbar spine degenerative disc disease.  Thus, there is a nexus between the Veteran's constipation and his service-connected lumbar spine disability.

As the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of the claim, entitlement to service connection for constipation, as secondary to service-connected lumbar degenerative disc disease, is granted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbar degenerative disc disease prior to April 29, 2021

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar degenerative disc disease from April 29, 2021, and continuing

The appellant and her representative contend that the Veteran was entitled to an initial rating of at least 20 percent from May 2018 until April 29, 2021 when the Veteran was granted a 40 percent rating.  See Attachment to the March 2024 VA Form 10182; see also March 2023 VA Form 20-0996 (seeking a 40 percent rating for the entire appeal period).

The Board cannot yet adjudicate the appellant's claims because the record does not contain an examination that sufficiently addresses the Veteran's level of functional loss throughout the appeal period.  See Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016); DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).  The AOJ's failure to ensure the VA examination contained sufficient information as required by existing caselaw is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) (explaining that the Board "shall remand the appeal to the [AOJ] for correction of an error on the part of the [AOJ] to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the date" of the rating decision on appeal); see generally 38?U.S.C. §?5103A.

Specifically, the Veteran had a November 2015 VA examination that did not address non weight bearing, or passive motion; and did not adequately address repetitive use or flare ups.  See November 2015 VA Examination Report.  The examiner did not perform passive motion testing or consider non-weightbearing.  In the remarks section, it was indicated that the examiner could not specify "if, when, [and] to what extent, in degrees, further 'repetitive use' or 'flare-ups' limit function" because it was not a contention with medical literature.  The examiner further stated that an opinion could only be provided if the examination occurred during a flare-up.

Remand is necessary to obtain a retroactive VA opinion that complies with the range of motion testing requirements as set out in Correia and adequately addresses whether the Veteran had additional functional loss during flare ups as required by Sharp.  Additionally, an opinion should address repetitive use in accordance with DeLuca.  Although the Correia and Sharp decisions were not decided at the time of the November 2015 VA examination, the AOJ should attempt to obtain a retroactive opinion for the period prior to April 29, 2021, to determine if estimates can be made that comply with existing caselaw, given the lack of information in the November 2015 VA examination.

While the record contains an April 2021 VA examination with sufficient information, the Veteran's symptomatology prior to April 29, 2021, is a relevant part of his medical history.  Thus, the second stage of the Veteran's rating is inextricably intertwined with the first.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (providing that two issues are "inextricably intertwined" when they are so closely tied together that a final Board decision cannot be rendered unless both issues have been considered). 

On remand, the AOJ will readjudicate the claims for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbar degenerative disc disease prior to April 29, 2021, and a rating in excess of 40 percent thereafter.  In so doing, the AOJ will consider all relevant evidence of record.  38?C.F.R. §?20.802(c).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a retroactive medical opinion from an appropriate VA clinician regarding the Veteran's level of functional loss of range of motion on passive motion, non weight bearing, with repeated use over time, and during flare ups during the period prior to April 29, 2021.  The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand, must be provided to, and reviewed by, the clinician before rendering the opinion.  The reviewing clinician must opine on:

(a.) Did the Veteran have functional loss in his lumbar spine on passive motion?

i.	If so, please portray any functional loss in terms of the degree of range-of-motion loss, if feasible.  

ii.	If not, please explain fully.

(b.) Did the Veteran have functional loss in his lumbar spine on non weight bearing?

i.	If so, please portray any functional loss in terms of the degree of range-of-motion loss, if feasible.  

ii.	If not, please explain fully.

(c.) Did the Veteran have any additional functional loss in his lumbar spine after repeated use over time?

i.	If so, please portray any additional functional loss in terms of the degree of range-of-motion loss, if feasible.  

ii.	If not, please explain fully.

(d.) Did the Veteran have any additional functional loss in his lumbar spine with flare-ups?

i.	If so, please portray any additional functional loss in terms of the degree of range-of-motion loss, if feasible.  

ii.	If not, please explain fully.

The clinician should consider all relevant medical and lay evidence in formulating any opinion.  The reviewing clinician is not to improperly discount the Veteran's lay statements of record or mistakenly rely on an absence of medical evidence in the record to support his or her conclusions.  

If an opinion cannot be provided without resorting to speculation, the reviewing clinician must provide a complete explanation for why an opinion cannot be rendered.  In so doing, the reviewing clinician must explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information, or that he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that question.
