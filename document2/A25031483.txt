DOCKET NO. 240427-435753
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The claim for service connection for OSA was granted in a January 2025 rating decision; there is no remaining case or controversy pertaining to the Veteran's claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

As there is no case or controversy within the Board's jurisdiction, the Veteran's service connection claim for OSA is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.101(d).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1983 to April 1988.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024.  In April 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, choosing to continue his appeal via Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  Direct review is the appeal option to the Board in which a Board decision is issued based on evidence of record at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a hearing or accept into the record additional evidence in its direct review.

Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 19.55.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.204.  

Analysis

On May 23, 2023, the Veteran filed a claim for OSA.  In a February 2024 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claim.  In April 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, and disagreed with the denial.  Although outside the period on appeal, in May 2024 and November 2024, the Veteran submitted VA Forms 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application and 20-0996, Request for Higher Level Review, respectively, and requested readjudication of his claim.  In a January 2025 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for OSA and awarded a 50 percent rating effective May 23, 2023.    

As a general matter, the grant of a claim of service connection constitutes an award of full benefits sought on an appeal of the denial of a service connection claim.  Seri v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 441, 447 (2007); see also Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (where an appealed claim for service connection is granted during the pendency of the appeal, a second Notice of Disagreement must thereafter be timely filed to initiate appellate review of "downstream" issues such as the compensation level assigned for the disability or the effective date of service connection).  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  Upon review of this matter, the Board concludes that there is no case or controversy within the Board's jurisdiction as the Veteran has been granted service connection for OSA.  As there is no case or controversy within the Board's jurisdiction, the Board must dismiss the matter.
