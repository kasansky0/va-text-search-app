DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Eligibility for benefits under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran died in February 2025. 

2. Due to the death of the Veteran, the application requirements for approval and enrollment into the program cannot be completed.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the appeal for eligibility for PCAFC benefits must be denied as a matter of law.  38?U.S.C. §§?1720G, 7104; 38?C.F.R. §§ 20.1302, 71.20, 71.25. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The?Veteran?served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1970 to August 1973.  

The case is on appeal from a March 2023 decision of the?Veterans?Health Administration (VHA), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the June 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a).  

The Board notes that the appellant was not afforded a hearing in this matter.  As explained below, the Board is denying the claim as a matter of law.  As such, the appellant is not prejudiced by not having an opportunity to provide testimony.

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that in a January 2025 letter the Veteran requested that the case be advanced on the docket. The letter referenced the Veteran's ill health, including heart failure, kidney failure, and pleural effusion.  Appeals must be considered in docket number order but may be advanced if sufficient cause is shown.  See 38 U.S.C. §7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. §20.900(c).  Sufficient cause includes advanced age (defined as 75 years or more), serious illness, severe financial hardship, or administrative error resulting in a significant delay.  An appeal may also be advanced if the case involves interpretation of a question of law of widespread application affecting other claims, although this is extremely rare. Any motion for advancement should be supported by pertinent documentation.  The Board finds the Veteran's ill health was good or sufficient cause to advance the case on the docket.  Thus, the Motion to Advance on the Docket (AOD) is granted and the appeal is advanced on the Board's docket.

Eligibility for benefits under VA PCAFC.

The Veteran and his spouse, M.L., applied jointly for participation in PCAFC in February 2023.  Sadly, the Veteran died while the appeal was still pending, in February 2025. The Board extends its deepest sympathies to the family of the Veteran. Unfortunately, due to the death of the Veteran, the Board must deny this appeal as a matter of law. 

The Board notes that PCAFC is a VA program that provides certain benefits to caregivers of eligible veterans who have incurred or aggravated serious injuries during military service.  38?C.F.R. §?71.10(a).  An "eligible veteran" means a veteran, or a servicemember, who is found eligible for a Family Caregiver under §?71.20.  38?C.F.R. §?71.15.  A "Primary Family Caregiver" means an individual who meets the requirements of §?71.25.  Id.  The application requirements under §?71.25 direct that evaluations to determine eligibility, education and training, and a home care assessment be completed after receipt of a joint application by the Veteran and the individual seeking to serve as a Primary Family Caregiver.  See 38?C.F.R. §?71.25(a).  Under 38?C.F.R. §?71.25(f), final approval of a joint application along with the designation of a Primary Family Caregiver will occur after the application requirements are met and is conditioned on the applicants' "remaining eligible" for program benefits, including the caregiver continuing to provide caregiver services to the Veteran and continuing compliance with all applicable requirements. 

Here, the AOJ did not find the Veteran eligible for PCAFC benefits under §?71.20 prior to his death.  Specifically, the June 2023 NOD was filed to contest the determination that the Veteran was not in need of personal care services for a minimum of six continuous months, one of the requirements for finding the Veteran eligible for the program.  See 38 C.F.R.  71.20(a)(3).  Moreover, eligibility did not remain in effect throughout the processing of the claim, as required by 38?C.F.R. §?71.25(f).  Final approval and designation did not occur by the time of the Veteran's death, the joint application was not processed, and the applicants were not enrolled in PCAFC.  See 80 Fed. Reg. 1375 (January 9, 2015) (Family Caregiver benefits are effective as of the date that the signed joint application is received by VA or the date the eligible veteran begins receiving care at home (whichever is later), but these benefits are not provided until a Family Caregiver has been designated.  Family Caregivers must complete all required training and instruction to become so designated).  

Approval for PCAFC and designation of a Primary Family Caregiver are precluded as a matter of law because the eligible Veteran and Family Caregiver are no longer eligible for benefits.  Therefore, there is no basis upon which to award the benefit sought in this case as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (holding that, where the law and not the evidence is dispositive, the Board should deny the claim on the ground of the lack of legal merit or the lack of entitlement under the law).  The Veteran's death precludes initial eligibility. 

The Board finds no potential avenue by which the eligibility requirements for PCAFC benefits could be met.  Therefore, this appeal must be denied as a matter of law.  38?U.S.C. §?7104(a); 38?C.F.R. §?20.1302.
