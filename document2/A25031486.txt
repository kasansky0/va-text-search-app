ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran incurred of a right knee injury during inactive duty for training on December 9, 1986.

2. The Veteran's right knee osteoarthritis resulted from his right knee injury incurred on inactive duty for training on December 9, 1986.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a right knee disability are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty for training (ADT) in the United States Army from August 1973 to December 1973.  A Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) previously declared this period of service active as a result of injury incurred in ADT.  He also served in the Army National Guard, including additional unverified periods of ADT and inactive duty for training (IDT).  

The Veteran submitted a claim for a right knee disability in February 2020.  A Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) originally denied the Veteran's claim in an August 2020 rating decision.  The RO determined that the condition neither occurred in nor was caused by service.  The RO also determined that there was no evidence of a chronic condition related to the Veteran's military service.  The RO also determined that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) did not contain complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for a right knee condition.

In the September 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  The Veteran testified at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in November 2024.  A transcript of the hearing has been associated with the electronic claims file.  As an appeal in which the appellant requested, on the Notice of Disagreement, a Board hearing, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the decision on the issue on appeal, evidence submitted by the appellant or his representative at the hearing, to include testimony provided at the hearing, and evidence submitted by the appellant or his representative within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  

There is evidence in the Veteran's claims file that arrived there after the decision on appeal, which means the Board may not consider it in deciding this appeal.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c)(1).  38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2).

Factual history

The Veteran was a unit member in the Army National Guard during various periods, including from March 23, 1985 to March 22, 1986 and March 23, 1986 to March 22, 1987.  Service personnel records show he performed IDT during these periods.  Service personnel records show his principal duties from January 1985 to June 1988 were as a CEV Turret Mechanic and Track Vehicle Mechanic in Co B 132 Engr Bn, Manhattan Beach, CA. 

The Veteran testified that he was a sergeant and a heavy vehicle mechanic.  He testified that he was working on a dozer.  He testified that he was taking the roller blades out to put new roller blades in.  He testified that he came out (from under the dozer), and all of a sudden, his right knee snapped.  The Veteran testified that his right knee disability prevented him from holding employment.

Service personnel records indicated that the Veteran was medically excused from AFPT due to a knee injury at annual training.  See July 1991 Annual Evaluation Report.  

In a medical opinion received December 2024 related to a Department of Labor Worker's Compensation claim, Dr. L.S. noted that the Veteran was employed by the Department of Army as a heavy mobile equipment mechanic in Sacramento, California and filed a claim for a work-related injury that occurred on December 9, 1986.  Dr. L.S. opined that the Veteran's right knee osteoarthritis was medically connected to that injury by direct cause, and that it (right knee osteoarthritis) was an accepted diagnosis.

Law

VA grants service connection for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary). Evidence must at least show the appellant has the disability for which benefits are being claimed, else, there necessarily can be no valid claim because, for all intents and purposes, there is no present disability to in turn relate or attribute to his military service.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  A current disability means a disability shown by competent and credible (i.e., probative) evidence to exist.  Chelte v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 268 (1997).  Pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability if it reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-69 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

In addition, certain chronic diseases, such as arthritis, may be presumed to have been incurred in, or aggravated by, service if the disease becomes manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation from qualifying military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Additionally, service connection on the basis of continuity of symptomatology can be established for the chronic diseases specified at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

However, the chronic disease presumption requires 90 days of continuous active duty.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3); Grose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 144, 148 (1993).  For Reserve or National Guard service, service connection may only be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred or aggravated while on ADT or for an injury incurred or aggravated during IDT, but not for a disease during IDT, except from an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101(24), 106; 38 C.F.R. § 3.6.  The presumptive provisions of "chronic" in-service symptoms and "continuous" post service symptoms do not apply to periods of ADT or IDT.  See Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40 (2010); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Therefore, consideration of the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307 and 3.309 (presumption of service incurrence for certain diseases) for any periods of ADT and/or IDT is not appropriate.

"When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant." 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  "Evidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other."  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability

The Veteran asserts that he has a right knee disability that resulted from a 1986 right knee injury that occurred while working as a Heavy Mobile Equipment Mechanic for the Army.  See, e.g., Board Hearing Transcript.  The Board agrees.

First, medical treatment records received contemporaneous with the claim show that the Veteran has a current disability of right knee osteoarthritis, status post total knee replacement.  See, e.g., Dr. M.M.'s May 2020 records.  

Second, at the Board hearing the Veteran competently and credibly testified about an incident during training on December 9, 1986 when he was working under a vehicle and when exiting from under the vehicle his knee tangled up and he suffered a cartilage tear.  Evidence received with the claim shows progression of the knee problems from the initial incident to present-day.  Additionally, the Veteran competently and credibly testified that he continued to have right knee problems from this IDT period to his discharge from the National Guard.  Finally, there is credible supporting evidence that the Veteran's right knee injury occurred during IDT.  In this regard, later service personnel records note that the Veteran was medically excused from AFPT due to a knee injury at annual training.  See July 1991 Annual Evaluation Report.  As noted above, the Veteran served in the National Guard, and thus the evidence must show that disability was incurred due to injury or disease at a period of ADT or injury during a period of IDT.  Available service records do not specify the exact dates that the Veteran served on IDT or on ADT after basic training.  Moreover, while the Veteran reported that the right knee injury occurred in December 1986, he reported to other treatment providers that the injury occurred in January 1986.  See, e.g., Dr. M.M.'s records.  At the Board hearing, he could not recall when the event occurred, nor whether there was a line of duty determination made.  He also could not provide clarity on whether the injury occurred during his National Guard job.  However, remand is not necessary to ascertain the exact dates of the Veteran's annual trainings.  Dr. L.S. noted that the Veteran was employed by the Department of Army as a heavy mobile equipment mechanic in Sacramento, California and filed a claim for a work-related injury that occurred on December 9, 1986.  Moreover, incurrence of the Veteran's right knee injury while working on a vehicle during training periods is consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's National Guard IDT service.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence for and against incurrence of a right knee injury during IDT is at least in approximate balance. The Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and finds incurrence of a right knee injury during IDT on December 9, 1986.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Finally, regarding nexus to service, Dr. L.S. linked the Veteran's current right knee osteoarthritis to his IDT right knee injury in December 1986.  While Dr. L.S. did not use the specific language of the evidentiary standard used to evaluate Veterans' benefits claims, the Board infers from the context of the opinion that Dr. L.S. meant that it was at least as likely as not, or that the likelihood was at least in approximate balance, that the right knee injury which caused the Veteran's right knee osteoarthritis first began in IDT in 1986.  A physician's choice of language is not error where, as here, the medical evidence is unambiguous and sufficient to comply substantially with the purpose for which it was sought. See Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-47 (1999).  Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence of a nexus between the Veteran's current disability and a right knee injury incurred in IDT on December 9, 1986 is at least in approximate balance. The Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and find a nexus to service.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  The criteria for service connection are met.

The Board notes that it considered a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU).  However, as there was not cogent evidence of unemployability, the Board has not found TDIU reasonably raised by the record.  If the Veteran would like to file a claim for TDIU, the Board invites him to submit a VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability with the RO.
