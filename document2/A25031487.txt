ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a burn scar on the left hand is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The most probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran has a burn scar on the left hand that is etiologically related to his service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a burn scar on the left hand have not been met.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2023). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve from June 2000 to January 2008.  He had periods of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) from June 2000 to February 2001 and from February 2003 to December 2003. 

In August 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (the Appeals Modernization Act or AMA), Pub. Law 115-55, which created a new claims and appeals process for pursuing VA benefits.  In an April 1, 2024, rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for a left hand burn scar.  On April 3, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealing the denial of this claim.  He requested the "Direct Review" lane, indicating that he did not want a Board hearing and would not submit any additional evidence in support of the appeal.  In an April 10, 2024, letter, the Board acknowledged the Veteran's appeal request and informed him that the appeal had been placed on the Direct Review docket.

Under the AMA, when a claimant seeks appellate review through the Board's Direct Review docket, the Board only may consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., as of the April 1, 2024, rating decision).  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Moreover, the Board is bound by any favorable findings in the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The Board notes that the April 3, 2024, VA Form 10182 also listed the issues of entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychotic depressive reaction or paranoid reaction, hearing loss, and sleep apnea and identified various rating decisions addressing these claims from 2020 and 2022.  However, these issues are not currently on appeal.

A Veteran must submit a VA Form 10182 within 1 year of the denial of a claim in order to properly appeal the claim.  Although the Board may not dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction due to an untimely VA Form 21-0958, Notice of Disagreement (as to legacy-era rating decisions), an untimely VA Form 10182 (as to AMA-era rating decisions), or submission of the incorrect form to appeal a given rating decision (e.g., submission of VA Form 21-0958 to appeal an AMA-era rating decision), it may dismiss the appeal due to non-jurisdictional reasons, such as a procedural defect, where the claimant did not substantially comply with proper claims processing rules.  See Ferko v. McDonough, No. 21-3467, 2024 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 800 (Vet. App. May 28, 2024) (stating VA can require a claimant to fill out a particular form and can dismiss nonconforming or untimely filings, but a failure to follow claims processing rules does not affect the Board's jurisdiction); see also Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021).

The Veteran had already appealed the hearing loss and eating disorder issues addressed in the August 2022 rating decision, and these were adjudicated in a December 2024 Board decision. Service connection for PTSD, psychotic depressive reaction or paranoid reaction, and sleep apnea were denied in an April 2020 rating decision, and a December 2022 rating decision found new and relevant evidence had not been received to readjudicate the PTSD and psychotic depressive reaction or paranoid reaction claims. The April 2024 VA Form 10182 was received well over a year after these decisions. As such, the Board finds these issues are not currently on appeal before the Board and will not be addressed in this determination. 

VA regulations provide that, "[u]pon request, a claimant is entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim . . . before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1).  That regulation does not indicate that the claimant is entitled to pre-decisional notice of this optional hearing.  In fact, 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(1) provides that, following a decision, "[c]laimants and their representatives are entitled to notice of any decision made by VA affecting the payment of benefits or the granting of relief . . . [including] the right to a hearing on any issue involved in the claim as provided in paragraph (d) of this section ...."  Read together with § 3.103(d), the only notice § 3.103(b) requires is that a claimant be provided notice of the right for a hearing with notification of the decision (by definition, a post-decisional notice).  In November 2022, VA amended VA Form 21-526EZ and in May 2024 VA amended VA Form 20-0995 to inform claimants of the right to a hearing at any time during the claims process.  The claim in this appeal was submitted in March 2024, but on the September 2019 version of VA Form 21-526EZ.  However, the Board finds that any error in the failure to inform the Veteran of the right to a pre-decisional hearing before the Regional Office (RO) was harmless error.  

In Bowen, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) found that when a claimant is denied a hearing before the RO, there is no due process violation if he is subsequently offered the opportunity for a hearing before the Board, even if a hearing was not requested or conducted, as long as there is no violation of due process concerning the Board hearing opportunity.  Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253-4 (2012).  The facts in the case can be differentiated on several levels, to include that the Veteran did not actually request an RO hearing and the issue in Bowen was not one of notice.  Regardless, the Board cannot find a basis to conclude that the underlying holding and logic of the Bowen case would not lead to the same finding of no prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.  The April 2024 notification letter informing the Veteran of the rating decision included a VA Form 20-0998, Your Right to Seek Review of Our Decision, outlining the Veteran's appeal options, to include a hearing before the Board.  Additionally, in the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran was provided with an option to request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge.  The Veteran instead selected direct review by a Veterans Law Judge, and the form explicitly states that by choosing this option, the Veteran does not want a Board hearing.  Because the Veteran was provided with notice of the right to appeal to the Board, as well as the right to a Board hearing, there was no due process violation in the processing of the claim or any suggestion that the Veteran was prejudiced by the failure of VA to provide a hearing at the RO level.  See Bowen. 

The Board has thoroughly reviewed all evidence in the claims file.  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim, and the Board's reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran.  The Veteran must not assume the Board has overlooked evidence not explicitly discussed herein.  

The Board notes that a VA examination has not been conducted with regard to the claim on appeal.  In the Veteran's April 2024 VA Form 10182,  the Veteran argued that he was denied service connection for this disability without ever being sent to a doctor.  Pursuant to McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), VA's duty to assist in obtaining a VA examination is triggered when (1) there is evidence of a current disability, (2) evidence establishing an "in-service event, injury or disease," or a disease manifested in accordance with presumptive service connection regulations occurred which would support incurrence or aggravation, (3) an indication that the current disability may be related to the in-service event, and (4) insufficient evidence to decide the case.  In this case, the Board finds that there is no in-service or post-service medical evidence of record referencing a burn scar on the left hand or a related current disability.  While the Veteran asserted in his March 2024 claim that he burned his hand on the hot tip of a rifle barrel during training while activated for active duty, no scars were noted on a Report of Medical Examination from June 2005.  As such, the Board does not find that a VA examination is warranted pertaining to his reported burn scar of the left hand claim.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues not addressed herein, to include regarding the duty to notify or the duty to assist, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110 (West 2002).  That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"-the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The term "active military, naval, or air service" is defined to include: (1) active duty; (2) any period of ACDUTRA during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty; and (3) any period of INACDUTRA during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty."  38 U.S.C. § 101 (24); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (a).  ACDUTRA includes full time duty in the Armed Forces performed by members of the Reserves for training purposes. 38 U.S.C. § 101 (22); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (c).  INACDUTRA is generally duty (other than full-time duty) prescribed for Reserves or duty performed by a member of the National Guard of any State (other than full-time duty).  38 U.S.C. § 101 (23); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (d).  Annual training is an example of ACDUTRA, while weekend drills are INACDUTRA.

For periods of ACDUTRA, service connection may be granted for disability resulting from injuries or diseases incurred or aggravated during such periods. For periods of INACDUTRA, service connection may be granted for disability resulting only from injuries incurred or aggravated during such periods, not disability resulting from diseases.  38 U.S.C. § 101 (22), (24); see McManaway v. West, 13 Vet. App. 60, 67 (1999).

To establish status as a Veteran based upon a period of ACDUTRA, a claimant must establish that he was disabled from disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during that period of ACDUTRA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (a), (d); Harris v. West, 13 Vet. App. 509 (2000); Paulson, 7 Vet. App. 466.  To establish status as a Veteran based upon a period of INACDUTRA, a claimant must establish that he was disabled from an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during that period of INACDUTRA.  38 U.S.C. § 101 (23); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (d).

The Veteran is seeking service connection for a burn scar of the left hand.  The Veteran asserted in his March 2024 claim that he burned his hand on the hot tip of a rifle barrel during training in service, leaving a lifelong scar that still burns and itches at times.  He asserted that rifles were used during training while activated for active duty.  

A review of the service treatment and post-service medical records reveals no complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to a burn or any scar whatsoever of the left hand.

Regulations provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).  In this case, there is no evidence of a burn scar of the left hand in the Veteran's service treatment records and no medical opinions of record linking any current diagnosis of a burn scar of the left hand to the Veteran's service.  

The Board has considered the Veteran's assertions that he has a burn scar on the left hand that is related to his service.  However, the Board finds that there is no medical evidence of record supporting such assertions.  Moreover, while the Veteran asserted in his March 2024 claim that he burned his hand on the hot tip of a rifle barrel during training while activated for active duty, no scars were noted on a June 2005 Report of Medical Examination after his 2 periods of ACDUTRA.  As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's lay assertions regarding an in-service injury are inconsistent with the medical evidence of record and are, therefore, afforded little weight. 

For these reasons, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for burn scar of the left hand, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application.
