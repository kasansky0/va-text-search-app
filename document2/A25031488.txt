2. Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the cost of non-VA medical expenses incurred from June 28, 2019 through June 29, 2019 is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran received medical treatment at non-VA medical facilities on May 11, 2019 and from June 28, 2019 through June 29, 2019; such medical treatment was not preauthorized for payment by VA. 

2. At the time of the May 11, 2019 and June 28 through June 29, 2019, non-VA medical evaluation and treatment, the Veteran had not established service-connection for a heart disability; his non-service-connected heart disability is not shown to have been associated with and held to be aggravating a service-connected disability; he had not received VA medical evaluation or treatment within the 24 months preceding the non-VA medical care; and, he was neither a participant in a VA rehabilitation program nor was he receiving VA nursing home care.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for payment or reimbursement for unauthorized medical expenses incurred in connection with non-VA medical care on May 11, 2019, are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1725, 1728, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.52, 17.53, 17.120, 17.121, 17.1000-17.1008.

2. The criteria for payment or reimbursement for unauthorized medical expenses incurred in connection with non-VA medical care from June 28, 2019 through June 29, 2019, are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1725, 1728, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.52, 17.53, 17.120, 17.121, 17.1000-17.1008.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1977 to April 1992.

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Community Care (OCC) decision letters dated on January 13, 2020 (two separate letters) and March 4, 2020.

On August 31, 2020, VA received a VA Form 10182.  The Veteran expressed disagreement with two January 13, 2020 decisions and a March 4, 2020 decision, and selected the Direct Review lane.  Therefore, the Board's review is limited to evidence on record at the time of the January 13, 2020 and March 4, 2020 decisions.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

For the sake of clarity, under the Direct Review option, the Board may not consider evidence that accumulated after the January 13, 2020 and March 4, 2020 decisions (more precisely, the evidence which the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) considered in the decision).  Upon review of the record, there is no extant evidence that accumulated during this time frame.  See Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

1. Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the cost of non-VA medical expenses incurred on May 11, 2019 is denied.  

2. Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the cost of non-VA medical expenses incurred from June 28, 2019 through June 29, 2019 is denied. 

Legal Criteria

In claims involving payment or reimbursement by VA for medical expenses incurred for treatment at a private facility, it must first be determined whether the services for which payment is sought were authorized in advance by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 1703(a).  If not authorized, it must be determined whether the claimant is otherwise entitled to payment or reimbursement for services.

When VA facilities or other government facilities are not capable of furnishing economical hospital care or medical services because of geographic inaccessibility or are not capable of furnishing care or services required, VA may authorize or contract with non-VA facilities for care.  38 U.S.C. § 1703; 38 C.F.R. § 17.52(a).  When demand is only for infrequent use, individual authorizations may be used.  38 U.S.C. § 1703(a); 38 C.F.R. § 17.52(a).  Non-emergent care by a private facility, including hospital care, must be approved by VA either through individual authorization or via contract.  Id.  

In cases where a veteran receives treatment at a non-VA facility without prior authorization, 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and 38 U.S.C. § 1728 provide that VA must reimburse the veteran for the reasonable value of emergency treatment furnished in a non-VA facility, or in lieu of that, make payment directly to a hospital or other health care provider that furnished such treatment on behalf of the veteran under the authority so long as certain statutory and regulatory requirements are met.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1725, payment or reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with emergency treatment (including for medical services, professional services, ambulance services, ancillary care and medication (including a short course of medication related to and necessary for the treatment of the emergency condition that is provided directly to or prescribed for the patient for use after the emergency condition is stabilized and the patient is discharged)) for non-service-connected conditions in non-VA facilities may be authorized.  38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000-03.

The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act provides general authority for reimbursement for the reasonable value of emergency treatment furnished in a non-VA facility to those Veterans who are active VA health-care participants (i.e., enrolled in the annual patient enrollment system and recipients of a VA hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care under such system within the last 24-month period) and who are personally liable for such non-VA treatment and not eligible for reimbursement under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1728.  38 U.S.C. § 1725; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000-1008.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1728, a Veteran is entitled to payment or reimbursement of unauthorized medical expenses incurred at a non-VA facility for treatment of a service-connected disability, or a nonservice-connected disability associated with and held to be aggravating a service-connected disability, when it is also shown that (1) the services were rendered in a medical emergency of such nature that delay would have been hazardous to life or health, and (2) no VA or other Federal facilities were feasibly available and an attempt to use them beforehand would not have been reasonable.  38 U.S.C. § 1728; 38 C.F.R. § 17.120.  The provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1728 are implemented under 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.120-32.

Emergency treatment means "treatment for a condition of such a nature that a prudent layperson would have reasonably expected that delay in seeking immediate medical attention would have been hazardous to life or health[.]"  More specifically, an emergency exists where there is "an emergency medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) that a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in placing the health of the individual in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part[.]"  38 C.F.R. § 70.2.

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  When the evidence persuasively favors against the claim of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable and the claim will be denied on its merits.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Factual Background

The Veteran seeks reimbursement for the cost of non-VA medical services incurred on May 11, 2019 and from June 28 through June 29, 2019.  In a statement dated in March 2020 (received with the August 2020 VA Form 10182), the Veteran reported that he was not made aware that he was eligible for VA medical care prior to the dates of service at issue.  He reported that on May 11, 2019, he felt uneasy and had left arm discomfort.  He sought treatment at the Northwest Medical Center emergency room (ER).  He reported that the staff "did not find anything wrong with me," but he was referred to a non-VA physician.  That physician saw him on June 14, 2019, and advised him to report to Northwest Hospital later that month for additional testing.  The Veteran reported that he called the Tucson VA to seek VA treatment but was advised he would not be able to be seen until August 2019.  

The Veteran reported that he was admitted to Northwest Hospital on June 26, 2019 and had a stent placed in an artery.  He reported that his private medical insurance denied coverage for the procedure.  When he showed for his August 2019 VA medical appointment, he reported that he was advised that he was eligible for enrollment in the VA healthcare system.  He reported that he was never made aware that he could register for VA medical care and that "not knowing and not being informed of these benefits has caused me serious financial hardship."  

Private clinical treatment records associated with the claims file show the Veteran was seen in the ER in May 2019 for complaints of left arm pain.  A June 12, 2019 treatment record notes continued complaints of left arm pain since; the assessment was exertional angina.  The physician found it "apparent he needs stenting."  The plan was to schedule an angiogram to evaluate for stenosis in the coronary arteries.  On June 28, 2019, he was "admitted electively for percutaneous intervention."  He underwent a cardiac catheterization with stenting of a subtotal left anterior descending artery lesion.  He was discharged on June 29, 2019.

VA treatment records show he was seen on August 9, 2019 to establish care for the management of coronary artery disease.  The record notes the Veteran continues with non-VA outpatient treatment and that he wishes to establish care at the VA.

Analysis

Upon longitudinal review of the record, the Board finds the evidence persuasively weighs against the claims for reimbursement.  Review of the record does not show that the May 11, 2019 treatment at the Northwest Medical Center ER was preauthorized by VA.  The record also does not show that the June 28 through June 29, 2019 non-VA admission and cardiac procedure were preauthorized by VA.  The Veteran does not contend that the two episodes of private care were preauthorized by VA.  Accordingly, there is no basis for awarding payment or reimbursement based on the presence of such preauthorization.  38 C.F.R. § 17.52.

In the present case, the Veteran has not established service connection for a heart disability.  The dates of treatment therefore were not for a service-connected disability.  The evidence also does not show that the non-service-connected heart disability was associated with and held to be aggravating a service-connected disability.  At the time of the treatment, the Veteran did not have a total disability permanent in nature from a service-connected disability and was not a participant in a vocational rehabilitation program.  Therefore, reimbursement pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1728 is not warranted.

The Board also finds that payment or reimbursement for the claims is not warranted under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 (for reimbursement of emergency treatment).  Among the eight conditions that must be met to be eligible for reimbursement under this authority, the Veteran must have been enrolled in the VA health care system and received medical services under authority of 38 U.S.C. Chapter 17 within the 24-month period preceding the furnishing of such emergency treatment. See 38 C.F.R. § 17.1002(d).  The record shows the Veteran did not establish care with VA until August 2019, after the dates of service at issue.  He thus does not meet the conditions for eligibility for reimbursement of expenses of non-VA emergency medical care under 38 U.S.C. § 1725.

Lastly, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's main contention, namely that he was unaware that he was eligible for VA treatment at the time of the non-VA medical care at issue.  However, under the law, persons dealing with the government are charged with knowledge of federal statutes and lawfully promulgated agency regulations, regardless of actual knowledge or hardship resulting from innocent ignorance.  See Morris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 260, 265 (1991) (citing Fed. Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 384-85 (1947)).

While the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran, it is bound by the statutory scheme created by Congress and is not permitted to award payments other than as authorized by Congress.  Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992); (citing Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 426 (1990)) ("[N]o equities, no matter how compelling, can create a right to payment out of the United States Treasury which has not been provided for by Congress.").

For the foregoing reasons, the Veteran does not meet the criteria for reimbursement of non-VA medical expenses under 38 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1725, or 1728.  Accordingly, payment or reimbursement for costs of non-VA medical care incurred on May 11, 2019 and June 28 through June 29, 2019, must be denied.
