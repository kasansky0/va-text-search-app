ORDER

An initial rating in excess of 20 percent for residuals of a back injury is denied.

An effective date earlier than May 26, 2023, for the award of service connection for residuals of a back injury, is denied. 

?

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's back injury residuals are manifested by painful motion. 

2. On July 11, 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim of service connection for residuals of a back injury, which was more than one year after a prior, final denial in a November 2013 rating decision, but within one year of a May 26, 2023 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for residuals of a back injury have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5237.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than May 26, 2023, for the award of service connection for residuals of a back injury, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.2500, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1966 to April 1969. 

This matter is on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision.

In an August 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the hearing docket.

A September 2024 notification advised the Veteran that a hearing was scheduled for December 2024.  The Veteran did not appear for the scheduled Board hearing because he was experiencing technical issues.  Later in December 2024, the Veteran's representative noted that the hearing should be cancelled and a memorandum would be submitted instead.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran, or representative, within 90 days following the date of the scheduled hearing.  38?C.F.R. §?20.302(c).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date of the scheduled Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the date of the scheduled hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(c), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

An initial rating in excess of 20 percent for residuals of a back injury.

Legal Criteria

Ratings are based on a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries.  The ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

The General Rating Formula for evaluating the spine provides for a 10 percent disability rating for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent disability rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Following the rating criteria, Note 1 states: evaluate any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, separately, under an appropriate DC.  Note 2 explains that the "combined range of motion" refers to the sum of the range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right rotation. 

Under the Formula for Rating intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes, a 10 percent rating is warranted with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 1 week but less than 2 weeks during the past 12 months; a 20 percent rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least two weeks but less than four weeks during the past 12 months; a 40 percent rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least four weeks but less than six weeks during the past 12 months; and a 60 percent rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the past 12 months.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5243.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Analysis 

By way of background, in a July 2024 decision, the Board in part granted service connection for chronic lumbosacral pain status post L2-L5 fusion.  In the July 2024 rating decision on appeal, the RO implemented the Board's grant.  The RO established a zero percent rating, effective July 11, 2023, characterizing the condition as residuals of back injury.  Importantly, following the filing of his August 2024 NOD, in an October 2024 rating decision, the RO increased the Veteran's rating to 20 percent, effective May 26, 2023, characterizing the condition as lumbosacral strain.  This post-rating decision and NOD action had the effect of changing the issue before the Board.  As such, the Board will now consider whether an initial rating in excess of 20 percent is now warranted from May 26, 2023.  No specific contentions were made outside of submission of the claim and appeal forms.

The evidence of record includes VA treatment records.  In April 2022, the Veteran sought VA treatment for chronic low back pain.  The Veteran indicated his pain level was at a "10/10" and his low back pain went down to his hip and leg.  During a February 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he experiences flare-ups that can last two weeks to a month.  Additionally, in an April 2024 correspondence, the Veteran indicated that his back pain causes him daily discomfort.  He stated that he walks with an irregular gait, utilizes a cane, and cannot be on his feet for more than five minutes without pain causing him to have to sit down.  The Veteran lastly stated he takes daily medication for the pain.  Within the period of review the Veteran was not examined for limitations of spinal range of motion. 

Based on the foregoing evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's impairment during the period of review most closely approximates the criteria associated with the 20 percent rating.  Here, the evidence within the period of review is generally associated with pain, which is accounted for with the 20 percent rating.  The evidence does not show forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 30 degrees or less.  The evidence of record also does not show favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical or thoracolumbar spine.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports that due to his back injury, he experiences daily discomfort, he walks with an irregular gait, utilizes a cane, and cannot be on his feet for more than five minutes without pain causing him to have to sit down.  Even when considering the functional limitations, the Board finds that the Veteran's disability picture or any additional limitation does not more nearly approximate the entire thoracolumbar spine fixed in flexion or extension, and one of the additional symptoms set forth in the General Formula Note 5 or the functional equivalent of ankylosis.  See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 20 (2021).  Furthermore, the Board has not considered any ameliorative effects of medication in assessing the severity of the condition.  Therefore, a rating in excess of 20 percent under DC 5237 is not warranted. 

Additionally, all potentially applicable DCs have been considered.  As the evidence does not show IVDS, DC 5243 does not apply.  In the October 2024 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy.  Other than that condition, the evidence does not show associated objective neurologic abnormalities for which a separate rating may be assigned.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's residuals of a back injury is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

An effective date earlier than May 26, 2023, for the award of service connection for residuals of a back injury.  

Legal Criteria 

The effective date for service connection is the later of the date of claim or when entitlement arose.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Reopened claims have the same concept.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r).

Under the AMA, an effective date can be based on the date a claim was first submitted if the issue is continuously pursued through one of the review avenues allowed under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2).  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

Analysis

Initially, the Veteran contended that an effective date for the award of service connection for his residuals of a back injury should be earlier than July 11, 2023.  See August 2024 NOD.  As noted previously, the issue before the Board changed after a post-rating decision and NOD action.  In the October 2024 rating decision, the RO set the effective date for the service-connected back condition as May 26, 2023.  This changed the issue before the Board.  As such, the Board will now consider whether an effective date earlier than May 26, 2023 is warranted.  No further specific contentions were made outside of submission of the claim and appeal forms.

By history, in April 2001, the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for a back injury.  In a March 2003 rating decision, the RO denied the claim.  In June 2007, the Veteran filed another claim of service connection for a back injury.  In a September 2007 rating decision, the RO again denied the claim.  In August 2012, the Veteran filed another claim of service connection for a back condition, which was subsequently denied in a November 2013 rating decision.  Following the decision, the RO sent the Veteran a November 2013 decision notification letter, informing the Veteran that if he disagreed with the decision, and wanted to appeal it, he must complete and return the NOD form, VA Form 21-0958, within one-year from the date of the notice.  The Veteran did not file an appeal.  

On May 26, 2023, the Veteran filed an intent to file claim.  On July 11, 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for residuals of a back injury.  In a November 2023 rating decision, the RO denied the claim, for which the Veteran subsequently appealed in a November 2023 NOD.  In the July 2024 decision, the Board granted the Veteran's back claim.

Because the earlier decision was not appealed and is final, and there was no earlier continuous pursuit of a claim prior to May 26, 2023, that is the earliest possible date; i.e., the date of the claim to reopen.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r).

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and an earlier effective date is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
