ORDER

A total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted effective May 31, 2023.

A special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate is granted effective May 31, 2023.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Since May 31, 2023, the Veteran's service-connected type II diabetes mellitus and diabetic peripheral neuropathies of the upper and lower extremities have prevented him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation.

2. Effective May 31, 2023, the Veteran had a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent plus additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a TDIU are met effective May 31, 2023.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

2. The criteria for SMC at the housebound rate are met effective May 31, 2023.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(s), 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350(i), 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1965 to June 1967.  The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted claims for service connection for type II diabetes mellitus with a 20 percent evaluation effective May 31, 2023, service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy left lower extremity femoral nerve with an evaluation of 10 percent effective May 31, 2023, service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy left lower extremity sciatic nerve with an evaluation of 10 percent effective May 31, 2023, service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy right lower extremity with an evaluation of 10 percent effective May 31, 2023, service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy right lower extremity sciatic nerve with an evaluation of 10 percent effective May 31, 2023; and denied the claim for service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy bilateral upper extremity in a November 2023 rating decision.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application on July 29, 2024.  The AOJ granted a 20 percent rating effective July 29, 2024 for diabetic peripheral neuropathy right lower extremity femoral nerve and diabetic peripheral neuropathy right lower extremity sciatic nerve, and service connection for left upper extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy with an evaluation of 10 percent effective May 31, 2024, and service connection for right upper extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy with an evaluation of 10 percent effective May 31, 2023; and denied a rating in excess of 20 percent for type II diabetes mellitus, in excess of 10 percent for diabetic peripheral neuropathy left lower extremity femoral nerve, and in excess of 10 percent for diabetic peripheral neuropathy left lower extremity sciatic nerve in a November 2024 rating decision.  The AOJ also dismissed a TDIU as moot in the November 2024 rating decision.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), on March 7, 2025, in response to the November 2024 rating decision.  The Veteran selected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge on his March 7, 2025 Notice of Disagreement.  In adjudicating the claim, the Board may consider evidence associated with the record at the time of the November 2024 rating decision.

The TDIU was raised part and parcel to increased rating claims which were filed on May 31, 2023 and continuously pursed.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009

The Board generally may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting a docket switch under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) has elapsed.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows claimants to switch Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) dockets by completing and submitting a new NOD within one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives an NOD, whichever is later, unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony.  In this case, less than a year has passed from when the AOJ mailed notice of the November 2024 decision on appeal.  However, the Veteran waived his right to switch to a different docket before the deadline to do so elapsed.  See March 7, 2025 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  Therefore, the Board will proceed with adjudication of the claims.

Turning to the merits of the TDIU claim, a TDIU is granted where a veteran's service-connected disabilities are rated less than total, but they prevent him from obtaining or maintaining all gainful employment for which his education and occupational experience would otherwise qualify him.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

VA will grant a TDIU when the evidence shows that a Veteran is precluded, by reason of service-connected disabilities, from obtaining and maintaining any form of gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  TDIU benefits are granted only when it is established that the service-connected disabilities are so severe, standing alone, as to prevent the retaining of gainful employment.  If there is only one such disability, it must be rated at least 60 percent disabling to qualify for TDIU benefits; if there are two or more such disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

For the purpose of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) disabilities of one or both upper or lower or one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from a common etiology or a single accident; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or, (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

In determining whether an appellant is entitled to a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability, neither the appellant's nonservice-connected disabilities nor advancing age may be considered.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341(a), 4.19. Factors to be considered are the Veteran's education, employment history, and vocational attainment.  See Ferraro v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 326, 332 (1991).

At the outset, the Board notes that service connection has been established for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (rated as 70 percent disabling); bilateral hearing loss (rated as 30 percent disabling); type II diabetes mellitus (rated as 20 percent disabling); diabetic peripheral neuropathy, right lower extremity sciatic nerve (rated as 10 percent disabling from May 21, 2023 to July 29, 2024) (rated as 20 percent disabling from July 29, 2024 onward); diabetic peripheral neuropathy, right lower extremity femoral nerve (rated as 10 percent disabling from May 31, 2023 to July 29, 2024) (rated as 20 percent disabling from July 29, 2024 onward); tinnitus (rated as 10 percent disabling); right upper extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy (rated as 10 percent disabling); left upper extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy (rated as 10 percent disabling); diabetic peripheral neuropathy, left lower extremity sciatic nerve (rated as 10 percent disabling); and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, left lower extremity femoral nerve (rated at 10 percent disabling).  The Veteran has one disability rated at least 60 percent disabling; or two or more disabilities, with at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Thus, the Veteran meets the threshold schedular requirement for an award of TDIU benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran was unable to obtain or maintain gainful employment due to his service-connected type II diabetes mellitus and diabetic peripheral neuropathies of the upper and lower extremities effective May 31, 2023.

In this regard, the record reflects that the Veteran went to vocational technical school for welding.  Since service, the Veteran reported primary employment working as a welder.  Regarding his current ability to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment, the evidence of record includes a VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, in which the Veteran indicated that it has been over twenty years since he last worked and that he stopped working due to his service-connected type II diabetes mellitus and diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities.

Turning to the medical evidence of record, during an October 2023 Diabetic Sensory-Motor Peripheral Neuropathy VA examination, the Veteran reported tingling and pain with "hot" sensation to bottom of the bilateral feet and difficulty balancing with weight bearing due to decreased sensation.  The October 2023 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities impacted his ability to work in that he has limitation in any activity/task that requires weight bearing due to limited sensation in his feet which causes an increased risk of falling.

In a July 2024 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran reported that his neuropathy impacts his ability to work in that his hands and feet go numb while he is standing or holding tools, making it impossible for him to work/complete the weld.  He reported that his type II diabetes mellitus impacts his ability to work in that he has weakness and fatigue making it impossible to work.

During an August 2024 Diabetic Sensory-Motor Peripheral Neuropathy VA Examination, the Veteran reported numbness and burning pain in his feet and numbness and pain in both hands.  The August 2024 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities impact his ability to work in that they cause loss of balance.

Based on the foregoing, and resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that since May 31, 2023, the Veteran has been unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to his service-connected type II diabetes mellitus and diabetic peripheral neuropathies of the upper and lower extremities.  See Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. 54.  See also 38 U.S.C. § 5107.  In making this determination, the Board has considered the Veteran's level of education and his primary employment history working as a welder, a position which involves standing for long periods and holding tools, aspects which VA examiners and the Veteran have indicated that the Veteran has difficulty with.  The Board therefore concludes that the limitations related to the Veteran's service-connected type II diabetes mellitus and diabetic peripheral neuropathies of the upper and lower extremities would not be practical in a position consistent with the Veteran's education, training, and occupational history.  The Board notes that the Veteran has stated that he does not have any experience in predominantly seated work, and he would not be able to re-train or work in a predominately seated position because his limbs and extremities are compromised, and his training/work history is specific for welding.  

In making the above determination the Board considered the Veteran's ability to adequately perform work requiring heavy/strenuous physical exertion, work requiring body movement/standing but no heavy physical exertion, and predominantly seated work; but concludes that the Veteran is precluded from all three due to his described limitations associated with his type II diabetes mellitus and diabetic peripheral neuropathies of the upper and lower extremities (numbness and burning in his upper and lower extremities and loss of balance).  Accordingly, the record adequately supports the award of a TDIU effective May 31, 2023.

Additionally, VA has a "well-established" duty to maximize a claimant's benefits. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).  This duty to maximize benefits requires VA to assess all of a claimant's disabilities to determine whether any combination of disabilities establishes entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114.  See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008) (finding that SMC "benefits are to be accorded when a veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim").

SMC is payable where the veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  This requirement is met when the Veteran is substantially confined as a direct result of service-connected disabilities to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or, if institutionalized, to the ward or clinical areas and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime.  38 U. S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

A TDIU was granted above based on the Veteran's service-connected type II diabetes mellitus, and peripheral neuropathies of the bilateral lower and upper extremities.  These disabilities qualify as one disability since they result from a common etiology.  Therefore, they satisfy the requirement for a single disability ratable at 100 percent.  Effective May 31, 2023, service connection was also in effect for PTSD (rated at 70 precent disabling), bilateral hearing loss (rated at 30 percent disabling), and tinnitus (rated at 10 percent disabling).  The combination of those additional disabilities yields a rating of at least 60 percent, and those disabilities are separate and distinct and affect different anatomical segments or bodily systems.  Thus, the criteria for SMC based on the housebound rate are met effective May 31, 2023.
