Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for colon cancer is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for coronary artery disease (CAD) is remanded.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for aid and attendance is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence demonstrates that the Veteran has erectile dysfunction that is caused by now service-connected prostate cancer.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to secondary service connection for erectile dysfunction are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1955 to October 1958.

This matter was appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2024 rating decision through submission of an August 2024 VA Form 10182 with election of the hearing appeal docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran within 90 days following the date of the November 8, 2024 hearing withdrawal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(c). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date of the scheduled Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the date of the scheduled hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(c), 20.801.

1. Service connection for erectile dysfunction 

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The Veteran has been diagnosed with erectile dysfunction per a May 2024 VA examination. The VA examiner explained that the erectile dysfunction is directly caused by the comorbid disease of prostate cancer. 

Service connection has been granted for prostate cancer in a separate Board decision under AMA docket number 240816-467223. Consequently, service connection is warranted on a secondary basis for erectile dysfunction and the claim is granted. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Service connection for hypertension 

3. Service connection for colon cancer 

4. Service connection for CAD

5. Entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR THE REGIONAL OFFICE ADJUDICATOR:

"	The Veteran has been found to engaged in toxic exposure risk activities (TERAs) based on the job duties required by his military occupational specialty as a Seaman. See May 2024 TERA Memorandum. 38 U.S.C. § 1168 requires an adequate medical nexus opinion and examination when there is evidence of TERAs and a current disability. The June 2024 VA TERA medical opinions obtained in connection with these claims are not adequate because the provided rationales are conclusory. The opinions also do not demonstrate consideration of the Veteran's TERAs with any specificity or detail, including their synergistic, combined effects. Thus, the service connection claims listed above must be remanded pursuant to this statutory duty.

"	The pending development and adjudication of the remanded service connection claims may materially impact the claim for SMC based on the need for aid and attendance. This claim will be remanded as inextricably intertwined. 

THE REMAND DIRECTIVES FOLLOW:

1. Obtain medical opinions from a qualified clinician that addresses the below:

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (evidence at least approximately balanced or nearly equal) that the Veteran has hypertension that is related to service as a result of the synergistic, combined effect of all of the Veteran's TERAs. Why or why not?

(b.) Is it at least as likely as not (evidence at least approximately balanced or nearly equal) that the Veteran has colon cancer that is related to service as a result of the synergistic, combined effect of all of the Veteran's TERAs. Why or why not?

(c.) Is it at least as likely as not (evidence at least approximately balanced or nearly equal) that the Veteran has CAD is related to service as a result of the synergistic, combined effect of all of the Veteran's TERAs. Why or why not?

The Board notes that the claims folder must be provided to and reviewed by the examiner for all post-remand cases per AOJ policy. See VBA Manual M21-1, Part IV.i.2.A.8.b. Thus, the examiner must specifically note that the claims folder was received and reviewed in the body of the examination report. In addition, a copy of this Remand must be provided to the examiner for review.

The examiner is informed that a positive opinion indicating a nexus to service does not require certainty. Rather, if the weight of the evidence is in approximate balance for and against a nexus to service, the examiner should make a determination favorable to the Veteran.
