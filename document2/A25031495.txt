ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent prior to March 25, 2022 for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to March 25, 2022, the weight of persuasive evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's GAD did not result in symptoms more closely approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a rating in excess of 50 percent prior to March 25, 2022 have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1983 to July 2003.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In March 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of increased rating for GAD most recently addressed in a May 2021 rating decision.  In July 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a July 2023 decision.  In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2023 decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

VA's percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38C.F.R. § 4.1.  If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38C.F.R. § 4.7.  All reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38C.F.R. § 4.3.

This decision will focus on the evidence pertinent to the rating criteria and disability severity during the relevant period on appeal, but the Board has considered the entire record to have a full picture of the disability.  See 38C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41; Gonzales v. West, 218 F. 3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

Earlier Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation is the day following separation from service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation, otherwise the effective date is the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 3 8 U.S.C. § 5110 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2). The "date entitlement arose" has been interpreted to mean the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought; this is determined on a "facts found' basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

The effective date of a rating is established by the date the Veteran's claim for increased rating was received, or the date in which the disability rose to the level in which the increased rating is based, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  If later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999); see also Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings).

Legal Criteria

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a veteran's present symptoms with criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on average impairment in earning capacity.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.

The Veteran's disablity is currently evaluated under Diagnostic Code 9400 (DC 9400), in accordance with the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula).  See 38 C.F.R. 4.130.  Under the General Formula, the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria.  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 (2018). The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating.  Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A 50 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short-and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

A 70 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

A 100 percent rating is warranted when there is total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of closest relatives, own occupation, or own name.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent prior to March 25, 2022 for GAD

The Veteran contends entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 25, 2022, for the grant of his 70 percent disability rating for GAD is warranted.  See July 2024 Attorney Addendum to VA Form 10182.   However, the procedural history of the Veteran's claim leads the Board to recharacterize the issue as a request for an increased initial staged rating for GAD. 

The AOJ granted service connection for GAD in a May 2021 rating decision, assigning an effective date of February 2, 2020, for service connection, with an initial rating of 50 percent.  The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in March 2022, seeking an increased rating for his GAD.  In the July 2023 rating decision, the AOJ increased the disability rating to 70 percent effective March 25, 2022.  The Veteran requested a higher-level review in October 2023, to which the AOJ continued the 70 percent rating effective March 25, 2022, in a February 2024 rating decision.  The Veteran then submitted a July 2024 VA Form 10182, appealing the effective date assigned to the 70 percent rating for GAD.  

The Veterans March 2022 supplemental claim was filed within one year of the rating decision.  Under the AMA, a supplemental claim filed within one year of a rating decision is in "continual pursuit" of the original claim, preserving the original date of claim.  When the AOJ granted a 70 percent rating effective March 25, 2022, it necessarily denied an increased rating for the period from February 2, 2020 to March 24, 2022.  

A Veteran is presumed to seek the maximum benefit allowed by law and regulation, and a claim remains in controversy where less than the maximum available benefit is awarded unless the Veteran expresses intent to limit the appeal to entitlement to a specific disability rating.  See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993).  When a Veteran appeals the effective date of a staged initial rating, the Veteran's appeal acts as an appeal of the staged rating.  See Dingness v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 491 (2006) ("A Veteran contesting a rating or effective date is presumed to be seeking the maximum benefit available under the law.") (emphasis added). Therefore, the Board understands the Veteran's appeal to properly encompass the entirety of the initial staged rating.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in December 2020.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with GAD and summarized his level of impairment related to his diagnosis as occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by medication.  At that time the Veteran reported that he was in a supportive marriage, had worked until retirement as a civilian employee for the Department of Defense, and at that time was employed as an information systems analyst.  The Veteran expressed he had ongoing anxiety, sleep problems, and depressed mood, but had not sought mental health intervention after retiring from active-duty military service.  The examiner noted symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting.  The Veteran denied suicide ideation.  Upon behavioral observation, the examiner reported the Veteran was neatly groomed and dressed, he was oriented in all spheres, and recalled personal information adequately, long-term recall and short-term memory, and concentration was intact.  The examiner noted further that the Veteran's processes were logical and goal oriented.   The Veteran's emotional expression was reported as "slightly blunted," but he exhibited adequate emotional control and frustration tolerance.  The examiner also noted that the Veteran's mood was dysthymic, but he interacted in a pleasant and cooperative manner. 

Notably, during this period, the Veteran's VA treatment records document that he consistently denied suicidal or homicidal ideation, his general appearance was alert and well developed, his speech was reported as normal, he was oriented to time, place, and person, his mood was euthymic, his affect was normal, and his thought processes was noted as not impaired.  See April 28, 2021 VA Treatment Record; see also May 4, 2021 VA Treatment Record; see also August 1, 2022 VA Treatment Record.  Additionally, there is no evidence of record that the Veteran exhibited any obsessional rituals which interfered with routine activities, that he suffered with hallucinations or delusions, had impaired impulse control resulting in unprovoked irritability with periods of violence during this period.  Further, the record indicates that the Veteran was in a supportive marriage for over 20 years, which does not demonstrate the inability to establish or maintain effective relationships, as required for a 70 percent rating.  

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptomatology did not result in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas to warrant a 70 percent rating for his GAD at any time from February 2, 2020 to March 24, 2022.  

The Board also finds that the Veteran's disability did not nearly approximate the criteria for a 100 percent rating at any time from February 2, 2020 to March 24, 2022.  

In this regard, there is no evidence of record indicating persistent delusions or hallucinations, gross impairment in thought processes or communication, grossly inappropriate behavior, and disorientation or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name, as contemplated by the 100 percent disability rating.  Consequently, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptomatology does not result in total occupational and social impairment to warrant a 100 percent rating for his GAD from February 2, 2020 to March 24, 2022.  

In sum, the Veteran's symptoms did not rise to the level of severity contemplated by the 70 or 100 percent rating criteria from February 2, 2020 to March 24, 2022.  Therefore, a rating in excess of 50 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's GAD during this period.  As the weight of persuasive evidence is against the Veteran's claim, the "benefit of the doubt" doctrine is not applicable; and the appeal as to the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the 70 percent rating is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
