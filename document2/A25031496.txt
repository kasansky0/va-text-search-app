REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1977 to March 1979.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO).  On the Decision Review Request Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) VA Form 10182, received in July 2024, the Veteran requested a Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  In this regard, the Board notes that under the direct review option, no additional evidence received after the appealed rating decision is to be considered; rather, review is limited to the evidence on record at the time of the decision.

By way of history, the Veteran filed service connection claims for a mental health disability, PTSD, hearing loss, right arm gunshot wound, right ankle, bilateral foot and lumbar spine disabilities on April 29, 2019.  Those claims were denied in a September 2019 rating decision.  

In August 2020, he submitted VA Form 20-0996, Supplemental Claim, with regard to claims for a psychiatric disorder, PTSD, hearing loss, and tinnitus.  He additionally submitted new and relevant evidence pertaining to his psychiatric disorder in August 2020, including lay statements and medical records.  He filed another Supplemental Claim in October 2020 addressing these claims as well as service connection claims for bilateral foot and lumbar spine disability.  Thereafter, a January 2021 rating decision, generated for backfill purposes, denied these claims.

The Veteran filed service connection claims for PTSD, antisocial behavior, right ankle, bilateral foot, lumbar spine, left arm gunshot wound, and bilateral hearing loss in February 2021.  A March 2021 rating decision granted service connection for tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss, and continued denial of the remaining claims.  However, the rating decision did not address the service connection claim for left arm gunshot wound.  Instead, it continued denial of the service connection for right arm gunshot wound.

VA continued development of the service connection claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder by obtaining a VA medical opinion in March 2021.  Therefore, new and relevant evidence was received within one year of the February 2021 rating decision.  A subsequent April 2021 rating decision granted service connection for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and assigned an initial 30 percent rating effective December 5, 2020.

The Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim in May 2021, identifying the April 2021 rating decision, and listed "PTSD, mixed personality disorder, passive-aggressive, and sociopathic."  A May 2021 rating decision thereafter denied service connection for PTSD and antisocial personality disorder on the basis that new and relevant evidence had not been received.

On January 12, 2022, the Veteran filed an intent to file claim.  In March 2022, he filed claims for PTSD, depression, anxiety, memory loss, insomnia, erectile dysfunction, lumbar spine disability, headaches, and left arm gunshot wound.  On the same day, he additionally filed a Supplemental Claim for GAD, PTSD, and left arm gunshot wound.  In support of his psychiatric disorder claims, he submitted a disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) in March 2022 noting diagnose for PTSD and major depressive disorder (MDD).  Accordingly, new and relevant evidence was submitted within one year of the May 2021 rating decision.  

Following further development, a June 2022 rating decision granted an increased 70 percent rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder, denied service connection for PTSD on the basis that new and relevant evidence had not been received, and deferred action on the service connection claims for left arm gunshot wound, headaches, and erectile dysfunction.  Service connection for headaches and erectile dysfunction were granted in a July 2022 rating decision, and a decision on the service connection claim for left arm gunshot wound was deferred.

In July 2022 and August 2022, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996 and requested Higher Level Review (HLR) of the July 2022 rating decision.  He asserted that the July 2022 rating decision did not consider claims for PTSD, insomnia, memory loss, anxiety, and headaches, and further asserted entitlement to earlier effective dates for his psychiatric disorder.  An August 2022 rating decision granted service connection for left arm gunshot wound and assigned an initial noncompensable rating effective January 12, 2022.  Additionally, an October 2022 HLR rating decision found duty to assist errors with regard to an increased rating claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder, the assigned effective dates for the award of service connection for left arm gunshot wound, the assigned effective date for the grant of an increased rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder, and the service connection claims for headaches and PTSD.

Lastly, the October 2023 rating decision on appeal continued the currently assigned 70 percent rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder, the noncompensable rating for left arm gunshot wound, and continued denial of service connection for headaches and PTSD.  With regard to the service connection claim for PTSD, the rating decision determined that new and relevant evidence had been submitted.

In his July 2024 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran appealed the service connection claim for PTSD, and the assigned ratings for his service-connected psychiatric disorder and left arm gunshot wound.  He additionally appealed the assigned effective dates asserting that they should be commensurate with the date he originally filed his claims in April 2019.  The Board further recognizes that the Veteran asserted that due to his service-connected psychiatric disorder, he was totally disabled.  Accordingly, a claim for entitlement to a TDIU has been raised by the record and is part of the current appeal.

Effective Dates

If a claim for disability compensation is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date of entitlement is the day following separation or the date entitlement arose.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  Otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final adjudication shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 1999).   

1. Entitlement to an effective date of April 29, 2019, and no earlier, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.

As noted above, the Veteran filed a service connection claim for a psychiatric disorder on April 29, 2019.  The evidence of record shows that he continuously pursued his claim by either submitting new and relevant evidence in the form of medical records, lay statements, and a DBQ, and VA additionally continued developing this claim by obtaining VA examinations within one year of the rating decisions adjudicating this claim.

Specifically, following the September 2019 rating decision, the Veteran submitted medical evidence in August 2020 noting a diagnosis for adjustment disorder.  Following the January 2021 rating decision, VA obtained a VA examination in March 2021.  After service connection for GAD was granted in the April 2021 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a DBQ in March 2022 noting diagnoses for major depressive disorder (MDD) and PTSD, to include anxiety and insomnia.  VA also obtained a VA examination in March 2022, and in a June 2022 rating decision, his service-connected psychiatric disorder was recharacterized as MDD with anxious distress.  

The Veteran requested HLR in July and August 2022.  While a review of the HLR request shows that he only identified the July 2022 rating decision, he clearly requested HLR of the June 2022 rating decision as he identified issues including PTSD, insomnia, memory loss, and anxiety.  This is confirmed by the October 2022 HLR rating decision which found duty to assist errors with both the assigned effective dates and the assigned rating for the service connected psychiatric disorder, claims last addressed in the June 2022 rating decision.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence of record shows the Veteran continuously pursued this claim since he initially filed his service connection claim in April 2019.  Therefore, the Board finds that an effective date of April 29, 2019, and no earlier, is warranted for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, and the claim is granted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of February 25, 2021, and no earlier, for the award of service connection for left arm gunshot wound.

As noted above, in his April 2019 claim, the Veteran asserted entitlement to service connection for right arm gunshot wound.  This claim was addressed and denied in a September 2019 rating decision.  The Veteran filed a service connection claim for left arm gunshot wound on February 25, 2021, in addition to several other claims.  A review of the March 2021 rating decision shows that VA incorrectly addressed service connection claim for right arm condition, and did not address the service connection claim for left arm gunshot wound.  Accordingly, the service connection claim for left arm gunshot wound remained open.  VA thereafter deferred action on this claim in June and July 2022 rating decisions.  This claim was not fully adjudicated until it was granted in an August 2022 rating decision which assigned an initial noncompensable rating effective January 12, 2022, the date of an intent to file claim.

Accordingly, as the Veteran filed his service connection claim for left arm gunshot wound on February 25, 2021, the Board finds that an effective date of February 25, 2021, and no earlier, is warranted for the award of service connection and the claim is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is remanded.

2. Prior to January 12, 2022, entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for an acquired psychiatric disorder is remanded.

3. Effective January 12, 2022, entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for an acquired psychiatric disorder is remanded.

4. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left arm gunshot wound is remanded.

In March 2022, the Veteran submitted VA Form 21-4142a, General Release for Medical Provider Information to VA, and identified treatment from several private medical providers related to these issues on appeal including Dr. Pamela Nelome and Jhamna Loewy.  An April 2022 letter from VA noted requests were made to obtain treatment records from these providers.  With regard to records from Dr. Pamela Nelome, a review of a May 2022 Report of Contact shows that three requests were submitted via fax over a two week period.  However, there is no indication that follow-up efforts were made to confirm that the record requests were received or being processed.  Two weeks later the Veteran was notified that records from this provider were unavailable.  Additionally, a review of the claims file does not reflect that any effort was made to obtain treatment records from Jhamna Loewy.

The Board further notes that private treatment records received in August 2020 includes a January 2009 treatment record showing the Veteran reported being incarcerated most of his adult life, and that he wanted to use therapy to help him transition into society.  However, efforts were not made to confirm the dates of his incarceration or to obtain any treatment records from facilities where he was incarcerated.  As these records would be relevant to the service connection claim for PTSD, efforts should have been made to obtain any outstanding prison treatment records.

Accordingly, the Board finds that a duty to assist existed at the time of October 2023 rating decision to ensure that the record requests for Dr. Pamela Nelome were received, to obtain identified treatment records from Jhamna Loewy, and to obtain any treatment records from facilities where the Veteran was incarcerated.  A remand is therefore warranted to cure the duty to assist errors.

5. Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

The claim for a TDIU is inextricably intertwined with the remaining claims on appeal.  See Parker v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 116 (1994); Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Request private treatment records from Dr. Pamela Nelome and Jhamna Loewy.

2. Make appropriate efforts to identify and obtain any prison treatment records.
