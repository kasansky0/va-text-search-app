REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for keratoconus is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1987 to February 1995, July 1996 to February 1997, and February 2003 to April 2004.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2023 by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In November 2023, the Veteran timely filed for a Higher Level Review (HLR).  The March 2024 HLR decision found no error in the November 2023 AOJ decision.  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision.  38?C.F.R. ยง 20.302.

Under AMA, the Board must remand issues to the AOJ to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.802(a).

As noted above, the Veteran served on active duty from September 1987 to February 1995, July 1996 to February 1997, and February 2003 to April 2004.  The claims file does not contain medical records reflecting the Veteran's original diagnosis of keratoconus.  February 2003 service treatment records during the Veteran's third period of active duty service appear to be the earliest record of treatment for keratoconus in the claims file, and those records indicate an original diagnosis date in October 2002.  

VA examiners in September 2015 and October 2023 VA examiners placed the initial diagnosis date in 1995 based on the Veteran's report of being diagnosed with keratoconus after a deployment to Bosnia.

An August 2023 VA examiner placed the initial date in 1990 noting a history of the Veteran using gasperm contacts since 1997.

In the March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that keratoconus was initially diagnosed in 2002.

Notably, the Veteran's original August 1987 entrance examination does not note any eye disorders, and service treatment records throughout the Veteran's first two periods of active duty service (September 1987 through February 1995 and June 1996 through February 1997) do not reflect eye issues, including a normal July 1994 vision test and July 1996 entrance examination, other than a notation of "defective visual acuity" on the January 1997 separation examination.  

A claimant is competent to report the date of diagnosis given by a medical professional, which is the date of diagnoses relied upon by the VA examiners.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, the Board must still determine the accuracy of that recollection which in this case as ranged from 1990, 1995 to 2002.  The date of diagnosis is particularly important in this case given the three separate periods of active service, and the different legal standards which may apply dependent on the date of diagnosis.

On the facts of this case, the Board finds a pre-adjudicatory duty to assist error in not specifically notifying the Veteran to identify the provider of treatment for prescribing gasperm contacts since 1997 and/or the provider of treatment for diagnosing keratoconus in 2002.

As the factual record is unclear, the Board defers consideration of the need for additional VA medical opinions pending the receipt of the outstanding treatment records.  See generally Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011) (discussing the "chicken-or-egg" dilemma faced by VA when requesting opinions and making credibility determinations with an undeveloped record and recognizing that fact-finding is a responsibility that is ultimately committed to the Board and not a VA medical examiner).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Assist the Veteran in obtaining reported treatment records specifically notifying him to identify the provider of treatment for prescribing gasperm contacts since 1997 and/or the provider of treatment for diagnosing keratoconus in 2002.
