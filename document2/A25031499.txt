ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for Hodgkin's disease is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for restrictive lung disease is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his Hodgkin's disease is at least as likely as not is related to his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for Hodgkin's disease are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1154, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1992 to January 1996.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a November 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim of service connection for Hodgkin's disease most recently addressed in a December 2015 Board decision, as well as readjudication of the claim of service connection for restrictive lung disease.  While the claim of service connection for restrictive lung disease had not been addressed in any prior decision, the AOJ evidently accepted the April 2023 VA Form 20-0995 as an initial claim of service connection for restrictive lung disease when it issued the November 2023 rating decision denying both claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  As the Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable finding, it may proceed accordingly, despite this procedural defect.  38 U.S.C. § 5104A.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the November 2023 rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence regarding the claim of service connection for Hodgkin's lymphoma that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for restrictive lung disease, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103.

Entitlement to service connection for Hodgkin's lymphoma is granted.

The Veteran asserts that his Hodgkin's lymphoma had its onset in service.  See August 1999 VA Form 21-4138.  Specifically, he asserts that he was exposed to toxins including aviation fuel while performing his military occupational duties as a System Organizational Maintenance Technician.  Id.      

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

If a chronic disease enumerated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), to include Hodgkin's disease (also called Hodgkin's lymphoma), is diagnosed after separation from service, the nexus requirement of a claim for service connection can be proven by evidence of a continuity of symptomatology.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  

When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue must be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

June VA treatment records show that the Veteran was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in June 1998.  In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma since December 1997; the Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 U.S.C. § 5104A.  

While VA has not made a finding of specific exposures during military service, the Veteran's July 1995 service treatment records (STRs) show that he was exposed to hydraulic fluid while working on aircrafts and April 1994 STRs reflect his exposure to lead-based paint.  January 1996 military personnel records show that he was a plane captain and that he performed work in a hangar.  

The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to attest to that which he has actually observed and is in the realm of his personal knowledge.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 471 (1994).  Furthermore, the Veteran's lay statements are internally consistent and facially plausible, given the types and circumstances of his service, including his documented work on aircraft and exposure to hydraulic fluid and lead; consequently, the Board finds his lay statements regarding his exposure to aviation fuel and other toxins while performing his occupational duties to be credible and of probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 1154; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995). 

Additionally, while the Veteran's STRs are silent for a diagnosis of or treatment for Hodgkin's disease, May 1993 STRs reflect complaints of profuse sweating, and June 1995 STRs indicate that he was being treated for symptoms including sweating for three weeks.  April 1994 STRs show that the Veteran was treated for a cough lasting four days after working with lead-based paint without the use of a respirator.   

Thus, the remaining inquiry before the Board is whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed Hodgkin's disease is related to his active military service.  Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67.

May 1998 VA treatment records indicate the Veteran's complaints of increasing fatigue and intermittent night sweats, and that medical providers presumed that his intermittent night sweats and fevers were secondary to his underlying disease.

In their respective August 2009 lay statements, the Veteran's brother and mother testified that the Veteran appeared weak shortly after his return from overseas service and that he would visibly sweat.  The Veteran's brother also stated that the Veteran's reported feeling "worn out and tired." 

In December 2009, a VA examiner noted the Veteran's symptoms of night sweats, headaches, memory loss, and shortness of breath, and diagnosed him with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in remission.  The December 2009 VA examiner opined that his conditions is less likely that not due to service as the illnesses shown in his STRs were acute and likely not the cause of his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and any exposure to lead would only cause lead poisoning and not non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 

In March 2016, another VA examiner noted the Veteran's symptoms of easy fatigability and headaches due to his diagnosed Hodgkin's disease.  The March 2016 VA examiner opined that his condition is less likely than not due to service as his STRs are silent for evidence of lymphoma or symptoms consistent with lymphoma, and there is no documentation of any specific exposure that resulted in his current lymphoma.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his condition in September 2023, at which time he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in treatment phase since December 1997.  The Veteran reported that an episode of frequent coughing led to testing for and diagnosis of his condition, and that he has residual symptoms including fatigue, generalized weakness, and shortness of breath.  No opinion was provided.

In a November 2023 opinion, a VA examiner opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's Hodgkin's lymphoma is caused by his exposure to military occupational hazards as "[t]here is no evidence from records or literature to support noted toxins to causing Hodgkin's lymphoma." 

After careful review, the Board finds that service connection for Hodgkin's disease is warranted.  In his June 1998 claim, the Veteran stated that his symptoms began in service, to include his sweating, which sweating symptoms in service were corroborated by his May 1993 and June 1995 STRs, as well as August 2009 lay statements from his brother and mother.  Moreover, May 1998 VA treatment records show that the Veteran had intermittent night sweats prior to his diagnosis, and that the medical treatment provider eventually presumed that his sweating was secondary to his Hodgkin's disease.  

The Board notes that lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional and that lay evidence can be sufficient to show continuity of symptoms after service.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  As the Veteran's symptoms of sweating in service were later attributed to his Hodgkin's disease, the Board finds that his lay evidence is competent, and as his lay evidence is internally consistent and facially plausible, the Board finds it to be credible and of probative value.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77; Caluza, 7 Vet. App. at 511.  

The Board acknowledges the unfavorable VA opinions from December 2009, March 2016, and November 2023.  However, while the Board cannot ignore or disregard the VA examiners' medical conclusions, the Board is free to assess medical evidence and is not compelled to accept a medical opinion.  Willis v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 66 (1991); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614 (1992).  

At the outset, the Board notes that all three VA opinions of record fail to consider the lay statements that the Veteran's symptoms of Hodgkin's disease began in service.  Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 40 (2007).  Additionally, the March 2016 and November 2023 VA opinions impermissibly rely on the absence of medical records corroborating the Veteran's Hodgkin's disease to conclude that there is no relationship between his disease and his military service.  Id.  Finally, the December 2009 VA opinion is factually inaccurate and inconsistent with the other evidence of record, in that it diagnosed the Veteran's with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in remission.  Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304.  

As the VA opinions of record are either factually inaccurate or ignore significant facts of the Veteran's case, to include his lay evidence, and fail to provide a fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion, the Board attributes these opinions little probative value.  Id.  In contrast, the Veteran's lay evidence is competent, credible, and probative, and as such, the Board finds that it supports a continuity of symptomatology since service and is sufficient to establish service connection, despite the unfavorable VA opinions of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309; Walker, 708 F.3d at 1338-39; Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77; Caluza, 7 Vet. App. at 511.  

In consideration of the above, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran's Hodgkin's is related to his active service, and as such, resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-782.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for restrictive lung disease is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that his restrictive lung disease is due to his exposure to military occupational hazards, including aircraft fuel, depleted uranium from munitions, and burn pits.  See November 2023 VA Form 10182.

As noted in the November 2023 rating decision's favorable findings, the Veteran has a current diagnosis restrictive lung disease.  Although STRs are silent for a diagnosis of restrictive lung disease, April 1994 STRs reflect his complaints of coughing and chest pain lasting at least four days following his lead-based paint-chipping duties at his unit without the use of a respirator.  May 1993 STRs confirm he was treated for potential overexposure to lead.  

A November 2023 VA examiner noted the Veteran's 1998 diagnosis of lung disease with an unclear etiology and onset of shortness of breath in service.  The examiner opined that this disease is less likely than not due to his military occupational hazard exposure as there is "no evidence from records or literature to support noted toxins to causing...restrictive lung disease."

Initially, the Board notes that the November 2023 VA opinion is inadequate as the examiner impermissibly relied on the absence of medical records corroborating the Veteran's restrictive lung disease to conclude that there is no relationship between his lung disease and military service and impermissibly ignored his lay statement regarding his in-service shortness of breath.  Dalton, 21 Vet. App. at 39-40 (2007).  Additionally, the examiner did not address significant facts of the case, to include STRs reflecting the Veteran's coughing and chest pain following his exposure to lead-based paint.  Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304.  As the examiner did not provide a factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion, the Board attributes the November 2023 VA opinion little probative value.  Id.  Thus, remand is necessary to obtain an adequate opinion.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an opinion from an appropriately qualified clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's restrictive lung disease.  The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand, must be made available to and reviewed by the clinician.  If the clinician determines that a new examination of the Veteran is necessary to provide an adequate opinion, one should be scheduled.   

After examination, if deemed necessary, the clinician must opine on whether it is at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) that the Veteran's restrictive lung disease had its onset in service, manifested within a year of separation from service, or is otherwise related to service.  The clinician must address the April 1993 STRs reflecting a cough and chest pain following exposure to lead-based paint, as well as any other verified exposures. 

The clinician is advised that the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  These reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion (to include the Veteran's lay statements described in the body of this remand).  If the clinician finds any medical reason to reject the lay reports, then an explanation must be provided.

The clinician is reminded that a lack of evidence or medical documentation cannot be corroborating to conclude that there is no relationship between the Veteran's current disability and his military service.  

The clinician is further reminded that the absence of a diagnosis in service is not fatal to a service connection claim and is insufficient as a rationale.

If an opinion cannot be provided without resorting to speculation, the clinician must provide a complete explanation for why an opinion cannot be rendered.  In so doing, the clinician must explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information, or that the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that particular question have been exhausted.
