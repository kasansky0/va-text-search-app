REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 2010 to February 2014.  During his period of service, he earned the Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal (Second Award), Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, Expert Marksmanship Badge with Rifle Bar, and Certificate of Achievement. 

In the September 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  However, on February 9, 2024, before to the hearing could be held, the Veteran, through his attorney, requested to withdraw the appeal; thus, the request for a Board hearing is rendered moot.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left hip condition

3. Entitlement to service connection for left knee condition

4. Entitlement to service connection for low back condition

5. Entitlement to service connection for right big toe condition

6. Entitlement to service connection for right hip condition

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  A substantive appeal may be withdrawn in writing at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the veteran or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In the present case, the Veteran perfected his appeal of the June 2022 rating decision.  On February 9, 2024, the Veteran, through his attorney, submitted written correspondence indicating a request to withdraw his appeal with respect to the claims of entitlement to service connection to hearing loss, left hip condition, left knee condition, low back condition, right big toe condition, right hip condition, right shoulder condition, and upper back condition, and entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus.  See VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, received February 9, 2024.  This written statement satisfied the requirements for a withdrawal and was effective immediately upon receipt by VA.  See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, (2020); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(3).

Thus, the Board finds that there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration at this time.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection to hearing loss, left hip condition, left knee condition, low back condition, right big toe condition, right hip condition, right shoulder condition, and upper back condition, and entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus are dismissed.
