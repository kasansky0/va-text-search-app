ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating (great than 0 percent) for left knee scars is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's left knee scars are less than 929 sq. cm in surface area and are not painful or unstable and do not have underlying soft tissue damage.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable rating (great than 0 percent) for left knee scars have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321(a), 4.1, 4.3, 4.31, 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7802.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2013 through June 2015 in the United States Navy. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. The rating decision on appeal was a higher-level review of an earlier November 2023 rating decision which granted an initial rating of 0 percent for left knee scars, effective June 3, 2023.? 

In May 2024 the Veteran submitted a Notice of Disagreement: VA Form 10182 with the April 2024 higher-level review decision. The Veteran selected the direct review docket. Based on that docket selection, and that the rating decision on appeal is a higher-level review decision, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the VA Regional Office issued the November 2023 rating decision. If evidence was submitted during the period after the November 2023 rating decision was issued, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.? 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim: VA Form 20-0995 and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.? 

Increased Rating

Legal Criteria

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C.? § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.?? 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating (great than 0 percent) for left knee scars is denied.

The Veteran's left knee scars are rated under DC 7802. The rating criteria states that burn scars, or scars due to other causes, which do not affect the head, face, or neck, and are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage must be at least 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater to warrant a 10 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802.

The Veteran's June 2023 VA examination notes that the area of the Veteran's two left knee scars is approximately 1.2cm each; totaling 2.4cm. Thus, the Veteran's scars cover a far smaller area than what is required under the diagnostic code for a 10 percent evaluation.

The Veteran's August 2023 VA examination notes that the area of the Veteran's two left knee scars total 1.5cm and 2cm for a total of 3.5cm in area. Again, far smaller than the area required for a 10 percent evaluation.

The Board considered whether evaluation under a different diagnostic code would provide a higher rating for the Veteran's left knee scars.

Diagnostic code 7801 relates to burn scars, or scars due to other causes, which do not affect the head, face, or neck, and are associated with underlying soft tissue damage. This rating criteria provides that a 10 percent rating is warranted for scars totaling at least 6 square inches (39 sq. cm.) 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7801.

During the Veteran's June 2023 VA examination, it was noted that the Veteran's scars did not involve underlying soft tissue damage. However, the Veteran's August 2023 VA examination the examiner reported conflicting information. Initially, the examiner reported no underlying soft tissue damage for the scars. Later in the report, it was noted that both scars have underlying soft tissue damage which covered 9 sq. cm. and 3.5 sq. cm. for a total of 12.5 sq. cm. Even if the Board were to discount the findings which note a lack of underlying soft tissue damage, the area would still fall well below the minimum threshold required for a 10 percent rating under DC 7801.

The Board also considered DC 7804 for unstable or painful scars. This diagnostic code provides a 10 percent rating for one or two scars which are unstable or painful. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804.

Both the Veteran's June 2023 VA examination and August 2023 VA examinations note that the Veteran's left knee scars are not painful and are not unstable. The Board has reviewed the record and can find no evidence that the Veteran has complained of pain in his left knee scar. Thus, DC 7804 is inapplicable.

Accordingly, the Board finds that assigning a compensable (greater than 0 percent) rating for the Veteran's left knee scars is not warranted.
