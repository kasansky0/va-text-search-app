CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to attorney fees, based on past-due benefits from the December 20, 2023, rating decision have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1969 to October 1970, during the Vietnam Era.

The appellant is the Veteran's attorney representative.

This matter is on appeal from a January 22, 2024, fee decision.

On January 23, 2024, the appellant timely filed VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement (NOD) to the January 22, 2024, fee decision and elected the Direct Review docket.

As an initial matter, the parties were provided with a Board docketing letter on June 10, 2024. The Veteran was provided a redacted copy of the appellant's VA Form 10182 pursuant to contested claims procedures on June 27, 2024. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.403-4. This is reflected in a June 27, 2024, AMA notification letter stating that a redacted copy of the appellant's Board Appeal Request (VA Form 10182) was provided. AMA notification letters were sent to both parties on June 27, 2024, and August 27, 2024. As the Veteran has not filed a response, the claim remains on the Direct Review docket, and the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the fee decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.405. 

Eligibility to attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a December 20, 2023, decision, is granted.

The appellant contends that he is entitled to eligibility to attorney fees based on past due benefits awarded in a December 20, 2023, RO decision. As will be explained in the discussion that follows, the Board finds that the appellant is eligible for attorney fees and the appeal is granted.

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5904.

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA. The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 (a). A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time. Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 (f)(1).

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney. To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined. Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits. A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g).

Fee agreements must be reasonable; those which do not exceed 20 percent of past-due benefits are presumed reasonable. See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (f). When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim. A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636 (h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3). The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran. See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection. The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision. If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3)(i).

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1); Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28 (2023); Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024).

On June 16, 2021, the appellant and the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-22a, appointing the appellant as the Veteran's attorney representative, and a Fee Agreement. The Fee agreement provided that the appellant was entitled to 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran. As such, the Board finds that the appellant filed a validly executed fee agreement in accordance with the regulations.

Historically, on November 23, 2022, the RO issued a decision denying service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). On November 22, 2023, within one year from the November 22, 2022, RO decision, the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, in relevant part, requesting review of the November 2022 denial of service connection for OSA. On December 20, 2023, the RO granted service connection for OSA with an evaluation of 50 percent, effective June 16, 2021. On January 23, 2024, the RO issued a fee decision denying appellant attorney fees, stating that VA never received a qualifying request for review.

As set forth above, fees may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1); Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28 (2023); Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024). In other words, there must be an initial decision. In Perciavalle v. McDonough, 101 F.4 th 829, 839 (Fed. Cir. 2024), the Court clarified that the trigger for attorney fees is a prior "initial decision". The second part of the analysis is then whether there was continuous pursuit of the initial decision; the continuous pursuit of the initial decision would constitute qualifying request for review.

In the matter at hand, the Board finds that the November 23, 2022, RO decision which denied service connection for OSA, was the initial decision. The Board also finds that the appellant's supplemental claim submitted on November 22, 2023, within one year of the November 23, 2022, RO decision, kept the claim in continuous pursuit. See Perciavalle, 101 F.4th at 839. As the November 23, 2022, RO decision was a triggering event for attorney fees, and the appellant kept the claim in continuous pursuit, the Board finds that the criteria for eligibility to attorney fees have been met.

(Continued on next page.)

In sum, the November 23, 2022, RO decision which denied service connection for OSA, constitutes an initial decision. Further, but for the appellant's November 22, 2023, supplemental claim filed on behalf of the Veteran, there would be no additional or past-due benefits awarded in the December 20, 2023, RO decision. Therefore, the appellant is eligible to direct payment of fees by VA from the past-due benefits awarded in the December 20, 2023, rating decision. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 5904. Accordingly, eligibility to attorney fees is granted.
