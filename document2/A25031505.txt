REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1978 to March 1978. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued on July 1, 2023, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the June 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability to include PTSD, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability to include PTSD is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he has a current psychiatric disability that was caused by multiple in-service events including observing another trainee attempt to commit suicide by overdose and observing the Veteran's drill sergeants' response to that event; being in close proximity to another trainee committing suicide by shooting; and being harassed by his drill sergeants. See VA Form 21-526EZ (April 2022); Buddy / Lay Statement (April 2022).

The issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the July 2023 rating decision on appeal.

Generally, VA's duty to assist claimants includes obtaining records in the custody of a Federal department or agency and making reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records not in the custody of a Federal department or agency, to include records from private medical care providers. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(1), (2).

First, prior to the decision on appeal, VA treatment records (VATRs), dated January 2023, indicate that the Veteran was receiving care at VA expense, outside of VA facilities, through Community Care, and the corresponding records were scanned into VA's electronic health records system. See CAPRI (July 2023). However, copies of these scanned records were not associated with the claims file prior to issuing the decision on appeal although they are in constructive receipt of VA. Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992); Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786, 793 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

Second, prior to the decision on appeal, the record reflects that the Veteran specifically identified medical records from Nystrom & Associates that would be relevant to his claim and attempted to authorize their release to VA in September 2022. See VA 21-4142a (September 2022). VA notified the Veteran that his authorization for release of these records needed a physical signature in a September 2022 Letter. See Subsequent Development Letter (September 2022). The Veteran then corrected the error by submitting a physically signed general release of medical records. See VA 21-4142 (October 2022). The record, however, does not reveal that the AOJ has attempted to obtain these records prior to issuing the decision on appeal.

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist errors on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the July 2023 rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Lastly, the Board acknowledges that a December 2022 VATR reflects that the Veteran was prescribed several medications by a non-VA medical doctor; that the same month, VATRs reflect that the Veteran does not have a VA primary care physician assigned to manage his care; and that , in order to coordinate VA services with the Veteran's outside care, VA requested that the Veteran bring his medications to VA so that VA can have a record of all his current medications. CAPRI (July 2023).  However, the Board finds that neither the VA treatment records nor the Veteran reasonably identify and relevant non-VA care. Therefore, the AOJ had no duty to make a general request for non-VA records. 38 C.F.R. §  3.159(c). As such, the Veteran is reminded that VA's duty to assist is a two-way street. If the Veteran wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential to establishing his claim.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991). The Veteran is encouraged to provide, or authorized release to VA, any relevant outstanding treatment records.

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Associate copies of the Veteran's Community Care records from January 2023 that were scanned into VA's electronic health records system, prior to the rating decision on appeal, with the Veteran's claims file,. 

2. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for treatment records from Nystrom & Associates. Make two requests for the authorized records from the non-VA medical doctor and Nystrom & Associates unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.
