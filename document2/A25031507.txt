ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as secondary to service-connected lumbosacral strain, cervical strain, and right lower extremity (RLE) radiculopathy (service-connected disabilities) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his OSA is caused by weight gain arising from his service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for OSA as secondary to service-connected disabilities are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran honorably served in the United States Army from May 1981 to May 1985. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In his August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim granted herein, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the evidence of record in conjunction with this case. However, it has limited its discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008). Thus, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim on appeal.

Entitlement to service connection for OSA as secondary to service-connected disabilities is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for OSA and contends that as a result of his service-connected disabilities, he gained weight, which caused his OSA. See September 2023 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim.

Service connection may be granted for a disability that is due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show: (1) that a current disability exists; and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995). While obesity is not a condition for which service connection may be granted, it may qualify as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and another current disability. See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017; Garner v. Tran, 33 Vet. App. 241 (2021); Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020).

An October 2023 sleep study shows that the Veteran has a diagnosis of OSA and he is service-connected for lumbosacral strain, cervical strain, and RLE radiculopathy. See November 2023 C&P Exam; Allen, 7 Vet. App. at 448. The question now is whether the evidence shows that his diagnosed OSA was either caused by or aggravated by his service-connected disabilities with obesity as an intermediate step between the two. 

In support of his claim of entitlement to service connection, the Veteran submitted a September 2023 private medical opinion. See September 2023 Medical Treatment Record Non-Government Facility. Therein, the private physician opined that the Veteran's OSA was caused by the weight gain arising from his service- connected lumbosacral strain, cervical strain, and RLE radiculopathy. 

There is also evidence against the claim. In an October 2023 medical opinion, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's OSA was not directly related to his active-duty service. See October 2023 Medical Opinion Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). 

Without further analysis, the September 2023 private opinion and the October 2023 VA medical opinion can be said to be, at best, of equal probative value. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511-12 (1995). In this case, the September 2023 private medical opinion places the evidence of record in, at the very least, approximate balance as to whether secondary service connection is warranted. The Board thus resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and his claim of entitlement to service connection for OSA as secondary to service connected disabilities is granted.. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102; 3.310; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
