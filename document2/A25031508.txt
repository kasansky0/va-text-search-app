ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for bilateral pes planus is denied for the entire period on appeal.

From August 25, 2021, forward, entitlement to an increased rating of 20 percent, but no greater, for lumbar degenerative disc disease (lumbar spine disability) is granted. 

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual employability (TDIU) prior to November 18, 2021, is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's bilateral pes planus has been manifested by pain on use and manipulation of both feet and daily moderate to severe flare-ups of bilateral foot pain, however, marked pronation, extreme tenderness of the plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement or severe spasm of the Tendo Achillis on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances, has not been shown at any point.

2. From August 25, 2021, forward, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his lumbar spine disability more nearly approximates the criteria described in the 20 percent rating.

3. In the year preceding November 18, 2021, it is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran' service-connected disabilities increased in severity such that they precluded the Veteran from obtaining or maintaining gainful employment. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a rating in excess of 30 percent rating for bilateral pes planus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5276.

2. From August 25, 2021, forward, the criteria for a 20 percent rating, but no greater, for lumbar spine disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.71a, DC 5237.

3. Prior to November 18, 2021, the criteria for TDIU rating have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS  

The Veteran honorably served in the United States Air Force from November 1976 to November 1980, and in the United States Army from October 1995 to February 1996, from October 2003 to January 2005, and from April 2008 to August 2010. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Higher Level Review (HLR) rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

Historically, the Veteran filed a September 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Compensation, seeking disability ratings in excess of 10 percent for his lumbar spine and a rating in excess of 30 percent for his bilateral pes planus. After the AOJ continued the Veteran's 10 percent lumbar spine disability rating in a September 2020 rating decision, more than a year later, the Veteran filed a November 2021 VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, seeking a TDIU. In an April 2022 rating decision, the AOJ denied increased rating for pes planus and degenerative disc disease as well as entitlement to TDIU. 

The Veteran filed an August 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Request for HLR, seeking review of the April 2022 rating decision. After the AOJ found in a September 2022 rating decision that a duty to assist error had occurred in the development of the Veteran's increased rating claims. The AOJ undertook additional development then adjudicated the claims in an August 2023 rating decision and again denied them. See August 2023 Rating Decision. The Veteran filed an October 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Request for HLR, seeking AOJ review of the August 2023 denials. In the February 2024 HLR rating decision on appeal, the AOJ considered the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 rating decision and denied the claims. 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims decided herein, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the evidence of record in conjunction with this case. However, it has limited its discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008). Thus, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claims on appeal.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. The percentage ratings represent, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155. Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  Higher evaluations may be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). This practice is known as staged ratings. Id.; see also Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007). The determination of whether an increased disability rating is warranted is to be based on a review of the entire evidence of record and the application of all pertinent regulations. See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).

Next, the words "mild," "moderate," "severe", "marked" and "pronounced" as used in the various DCs are not defined in the Rating Schedule. When utilizing the following adjectives in its analysis below, the Board intends the common meaning of the adjectives, defined by Miriam Webster's Online Dictionary: "mild," defined as "gentle in nature of behavior" or "not being or involving what is extreme"; "moderate," defined as "not violent, severe, or intense" or "limited in scope or effect;" and "severe," defined as "causing discomfort or hardship;" "very painful or harmful;" "of a great degree;" "marked," as "having a distinctive or emphasized character;" and "pronounced," as "strongly marked." A flare-up is defined as "'a sudden increase in symptoms of a latent or subsiding disease." See Crowe v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 238, 247 (1994). 

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the Veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a [or 4.73] criteria.").

Indeed, the intent of the rating schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability. Thus, it is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59; Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011). In Petitti v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 415 (2015), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) rejected VA's argument that § 4.59 requires painful motion, such that the mere presence of joint pain is not sufficient. Id. at 428-29. The Court held that under § 4.59, "the trigger for a minimum disability rating is an actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joint," explaining that § 4.59 speaks to both painful motion of joints and actually painful joints. Id. at 425. Moreover, the Court held that § 4.59 does not require "objective" evidence but can be satisfied with lay and other non-medical evidence. Id. at 429.

However, a Veteran may be entitled to a higher disability evaluation than that supported by mechanical application of the rating schedule where there is evidence that his or her disability causes "additional functional loss i.e., 'the inability...to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination[,] and endurance' including as due to pain and/or other factors" or "reduction of a joint's normal excursion of movement in different planes, including changes in the joint's range of movement, strength, fatigability, or coordination." Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107, 117-18 (2017) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and citing 38 C.F.R. § 4.45); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 36-37 (2011); DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 205-07 (1995).

Turning to the adequacy of VA examinations, the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint." Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016). The Board observes that the spine has no opposite joint. In Sharp, the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the Veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination. Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).

When evaluating a disability under VA's General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, the criteria for a rating based on ankylosis may be met by evidence demonstrating the functional equivalent of ankylosis i.e., functional loss consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis. See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45; Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 32; DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 202. The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and 4.45 are for application when evaluating joint disabilities and their manifestations, which may include ankylosis. These sections direct adjudicators to determine whether the joint demonstrates less movement than normal and ankylosis is specifically identified among the possible causes of less movement. Moreover, § 4.40 provides that "functional loss may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion." Accordingly, the Court in Chavis found that the application of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and 4.45 permits consideration under the General Rating Formula of an evaluation based on ankylosis if a claimant's functional loss is consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis or if it is the functional equivalent of ankylosis.

The Board considers not only the criteria of the currently assigned DCs, but also the criteria of other potentially applicable DCs. In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. However, the evaluation of the same "disability" or the same "manifestations" under various diagnoses is not allowed. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. A claimant may not be compensated twice for the same symptomatology as "such a result would overcompensate the claimant for the actual impairment of his [or her] earning capacity." See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; Brady v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 203, 206 (1993). This would result in pyramiding, contrary to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. However, if a Veteran has separate and distinct manifestations attributable to the same injury, they should be compensated under different DCs. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259 (1994); Fanning v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 225, 230 (1993). 

In deciding an appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material favorable to the claimant. Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990). Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility. Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination about the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted. Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). 

When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a Veteran's disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  A Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses. See Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469. Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). Lay evidence may establish a diagnosis of a simple medical condition, a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or symptoms that later support a diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. If the evidence is competent, the Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief. Barr, 21 Vet. App. 308. After determining the competency and credibility of evidence, the Board must then weigh its probative value. In this regard, the Board may properly consider internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the claimant. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511-12 (1995).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions will be equitable and just as contemplated by the requirements of the law. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. When, after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102 (reasonable doubt to be resolved in Veteran's favor), 4.3; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (the benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies if the competing evidence is in approximate balance). In applying the benefit of the doubt rule, the Board is required to assign probative weight to relevant evidence, make a specific finding as to which evidence the Board finds more persuasive, and provide the reasoning for such finding. Bufkin v. McDonough, 75 F.4th 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2023). All medical definitions utilized herein may be found at Dorland's Medical Dictionary Online.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for bilateral pes planus is denied for the entire period on appeal.

The Veteran seeks a rating in excess of 30 percent for his bilateral pes planus and generally contends that it warrants the next highest, 50 percent rating. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. As the current claim for an increased rating claim arises from the November 2021 VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, the Board will therefore carefully analyze and consider the evidence from November 2020, forward to determine when an increase in the Veteran's bilateral pes planus was factually ascertainable. See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015) (all of the facts should be examined in determining the effective date for an increased rating which is predicated on when the increase in the level of severity can be ascertained).

The Veteran's bilateral pes planus (defined as a condition in which one or more of the arches of the foot have been lowered and flattened out) is rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5276. Under DC 5276, a 30 percent rating is warranted where the bilateral condition is severe; objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use, characteristic callosities, and a 50 percent rating is warranted where the bilateral condition is pronounced; marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the Tendo Achillis on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances.

A thorough review of the Veteran's Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) treatment records reveal a May 2020 encounter wherein the Veteran reported chronic foot pain which increased after walking and running and when he woke up, that his pain was a seven on a scale from one to ten, and that he used a golf ball to massage his feet, and foot soaks to ease his pain. See February 2021 CAPRI. In June 2020, the Veteran stated that he was unable to exercise (run) at the same frequency or duration due to pain in his foot, knees, and back. He again reported bilateral foot pain in July 2020. A September 2020 entry notes that the Veteran used orthotics to treat his bilateral pes planus but as he did not wear them inside his house, he experienced pain. In April 2021, the Veteran returned to the podiatry clinic and reported sharp pain upon ambulation which he rated as a five to six on a scale from one to ten, and that he used custom made orthotics with minimal relief. In May 2021, the Veteran reported bilateral foot pain which increased with standing, hiking, walking, and when using the stairs, and that his orthotics provided minimal relief; a VA podiatrist noted that the Veteran had bilateral painful hammertoes, metatarsalgia (defined as pain and tenderness in the metatarsal region (the ball of the foot where the bones that connect to the ankle to the toes meet the toes). Continued analysis of the Veteran's VAMC treatment records show that in July 2021, he reported idiopathic (defined as of unknown cause or spontaneous origin) bilateral foot pain located on the top of his feet, which he described was previously located on the bottom of his feet, and a July 2021 x-ray report which showed minimal degenerative changes in both feet. During a November 2021 encounter, the Veteran expressed that he was unable to exercise regularly due to the pain in his back and feet. In August 2023, the Veteran reported bilateral foot pain which increased when going up or down stairs.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination to determine the severity of his bilateral pes planus in December 2021. See December 2021 Foot Conditions, Including Flatfoot (Pes Planus) Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). Therein, the examiner noted that the Veteran's previous diagnoses of bilateral pes planus and plantar fasciitis (defined as the inflammation of plantar fascia) and his reports of pain which was worsening over time. The Veteran reported foot pain which he rated as an eight to a nine on a scale of one to ten on the top of his feet which he treated with stretching, and massage with a ball. The Veteran reported pain at the time of the examination which was manifest as constant pressure and further detailed that he experienced severe, daily flare-ups of foot pain which lasted three to four hours in duration which were precipitated by walking and running, manifested by a feeling of pressure on the surface of the foot, and were alleviated by with stretching and massage with a ball. The examiner noted the Veteran's reports of functional loss both during and in the absence of a flare-up that he experienced difficulty with walking and standing. The examiner noted that the Veteran regularly used orthotic inserts for the treatment of bilateral pes planus. 

Upon physical examination, the Veteran was found to have bilateral accentuated pain on use and pain on manipulation. The examiner further found that the Veteran had decreased longitudinal arch height and inward bowing of the "inward" bowing of the Achilles' tendon, however, but marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the Achilles' tendon (rigid hindfoot) was not found. Swelling, characteristic calluses, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces, evidence of marked deformity, or marked pronation was not found during the examination of either of the Veteran's feet. Turning to the Veteran's functional loss, the examiner found that the Veteran's pain with walking and standing significantly limited the Veteran's functional ability during flare-ups. Further, the examiner noted that the Veteran's bilateral foot pain was "persistent" and present during rest as well as during passive, active, weight-bearing, nonweight-bearing movements. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's difficulty with walking and standing caused by his bilateral pes planus would impair his ability to perform occupational tasks. 

Before addressing the merits of the Veteran's increased rating claim, the Board notes that it will resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran regarding the concurrent pain and functional impairment arising from his non-service-connected plantar fasciitis, metatarsalgia, and hammer toes during the period on appeal. See Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181, 182 (1998) (per curiam) (explaining that VA must apply the benefit of the doubt doctrine and attribute the inseparable effects of a disability to the claimant's service-connected disability).

However, after a thorough and holistic review of the evidence of record, including the Veteran's lay statements regarding the severity of his bilateral pes planus disability and the findings of the December 2021 VA examiner, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of a 50 percent rating any point during the period on appeal. In finding that the Veteran's disability continues to warrant a 30 percent rating, the Board finds the findings of the December 2021 VA examiner that the Veteran had pain on use and manipulation of both feet and that he experienced daily severe flare-ups of both feet, functional loss, and functional impairment, together with the Veteran's lay statements that his flare-up pain is severe, to be the most probative evidence that a 30 percent disability rating is warranted. Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781; Bufkin, 75 F.4th at 1374. While the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's pain and functional impairment, a bilateral pes planus disability which warrants a 50 percent rating is manifest by marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the Tendo Achillis on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances. The weight of the lay and medical evidence is against a finding that such disability has been shown at any point during the period on appeal. 

In the absence of evidence showing that his bilateral pes planus warrants a higher rating, there is thus no doubt herein to resolve, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781.

2. From August 25, 2021, forward, entitlement to an increased rating of 20 percent, but no greater, for lumbar spine disability is granted.

The Veteran seeks a rating in excess of 10 percent for his lumbar spine disability and generally contends that it is more severe than currently rated. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. As the current claim for an increased rating claim arises from the November 2021 VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, the Board will therefore carefully analyze and consider the evidence from November 2020, forward to determine when an increase in the Veteran's lumbar spine was factually ascertainable.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d at 984; Swain, 27 Vet. App. at 224. 

During the pendency of the appeal, portions of the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71 were amended effective February 7, 2021. However, DC 5237 was not substantively changed. Under DC 5237, the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees, but not greater than 60 degrees; or, combined range of motion (ROM) of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, if there is muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. Id. A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine and a 100 percent rating is warranted for ankylosis of the entire spine. Id. 

Note (1) states any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, should be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.

Note (2) provides that normal forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is to zero to 90 degrees and extension and left and right lateral flexion and rotation of the thoracolumbar spine are all zero to 30 degrees. The combined ROM refers to the sum of the range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right rotation. The normal combined ROM of the thoracolumbar spine is 240 degrees. Each ROM measurement is to be rounded to the nearest five degrees.

Note (3) states that in exceptional cases, an examiner may state that because of age, body habitus, neurologic disease, or other factors not the result of disease or injury of the spine, the ROM of the spine in a particular individual should be considered normal for that individual, even though it does not conform to the normal ROM stated in Note (2). Provided that the examiner supplies an explanation, the examiner's assessment that the ROM is normal for that individual will be accepted.

Note (4) provides that each ROM measurement is to be rounded to the nearest five degrees.

Note (5) states that for VA compensation purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching. Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.

Turning to the evidence of record, in April 2021, the Veteran called VA and stated that had back pain which was rated at an eight to a nine on a scale of one to ten in his lower back and denied numbness, tingling or pain shooting down his legs. The Veteran further detailed that he had not taken medication, that he had tried to do stretching exercises to no avail, and that he was able to walk but not stand. The Veteran returned to VA and was seen in May 2021 wherein he reported lower back pain which did not radiate into his lower extremities and was relieved with massage and stretching. Further review of another May 2021 encounter shows that the Veteran reported chronic back pain and engaged in virtual Tai Chi classes for the management of same. In August 2021, the Veteran reported that he had recently completed culinary school but was unable to work as a cook because it hurt his back. 

The Veteran was seen on August 25, 2021, for physical therapy for his back wherein he reported pain along the beltline of his lower back which had increased recently and was worse on his left side, did not radiate into his bilateral lower extremities, and increased with prolonged sitting and standing. The physical therapist noted that the Veteran's reports were consistent with lumbar movement coordination impairment with pain, pain with prolonged positions, and associated sensitivity. The Veteran attended physical therapy again in September 2021 and October 2021 and reported continued back pain. He reported back pain during a visit with his primary care provider in October 2021. During a November 2021 encounter, the Veteran expressed that he was unable to exercise regularly due to the pain in his back and feet. Continued, thorough analysis of the Veteran's VAMC treatment records after his December 2021 VA examination and through the remainder of the appeal period reveal his ongoing reports of chronic back pain without radiculopathy in April 2022 and August 2022. See February and August 2023 CAPRIs. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination to determine the severity of his lumbar spine disability in December 2021. See December 2021 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) Conditions DBQ. Therein, the examiner noted the Veteran's previous diagnosis of degenerative disc disease and his reports that his disability had worsened. The Veteran detailed that his current symptoms consisted of lower back pain which was a four to a seven on a scale of one to ten which worsened with lifting or carrying items and walking and was relieved by stretching, massage, and electrical stimulation via a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit. Despite these reports, the examiner found that the Veteran did not report flare-ups of the thoracolumbar spine, but that he did report functional loss as evidenced by his reports of difficulty walking, running, sitting, standing, bending, and lifting. On physical examination, the examiner noted localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the left sacral iliac region (defined as the area where the triangular-shaped bone at the base of the spine) meets the ilium (part of the pelvis)), but that the localized tenderness did not result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour. The examiner further found that the interference with the Veteran's ability to sit, stand, bend, lift, and ambulate were additional contributing factors of his disability. No muscle atrophy, radiculopathy, or ankylosis was found. The examiner found that the Veteran's difficulty walking, standing, sitting, bending and lifting would impair his ability to perform occupation tasks. 

On testing, initial range of movement (ROM) of the lumbar spine was noted as normal. The Veteran's forward flexion was to 90 degrees, and his extension, right and left lateral, and right and left rotation movements were all found to be 30 degrees. Pain was noted during extension, right and left lateral, and right and left rotation, and the Veteran's combined ROM measurements equaled 240 degrees. Passive ROM movements were performed. The Veteran's passive ROM measurements were found to be the same as his active ROM, but pain was noted during extension, right and left lateral, and right and left rotation movements. The examiner found that there was evidence of pain during weight-bearing, nonweight-bearing, active, and passive movements which reduced the Veteran's ROM and caused functional loss. Repetitive testing was performed; no additional loss of function or ROM after three repetitions was noted. Despite the completion of repetitive testing, the examiner indicated that the Veteran was not being examined immediately after repeated use over time. The examiner indicated that the statements from the Veteran did not suggest pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination which significantly limited the Veteran's functional ability with repeated use over time. 

Before addressing the merits of the Veteran's claim, the Board turns to address the adequacy of the December 2021 VA examination. Despite the Veteran's reports of increased pain with prolonged sitting, standing, bending, and lifting, the December 2021 VA examiner found that he did not experience flare-ups and thus did not include estimated ROM measurements or any information regarding same. See Sharp, 29 Vet. App. at 32; see Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 44 (returning a medical examination that failed to address any range-of-motion loss specifically due to pain and any functional loss during flare ups). Further, the examiner's conclusion that the Veteran's ROM was reduced and caused functional loss conflicts with the normal ROM measurements throughout the examination report. Additionally, the examiner found that the Veteran was not being examined immediately after repeated use over time despite the completion of repetitive testing during the examination. 

However, the Board declines to remand this matter for a retrospective opinion due to the impracticality of obtaining such evidence as might be needed to retrospectively address the deficiencies of the December 2021 examination. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.326(a) ("Where there is a claim for disability compensation or pension but medical evidence accompanying the claim is not adequate for rating purposes, a Department of Veterans Affairs examination will be authorized."), 4.2; Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80 (2008); Vigil v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 63 (2008) (holding that the duty to assist may include development of medical evidence through a retrospective medical evaluation where there is a lack of medical evidence for the time period being rated). Indeed, remanding these issues can often lead to a cycle of non-compliant examination reports and subsequent remands that can delay the claim for years without an effective resolution. The Board will not place the burden on the Veteran for the fact that the examiner did not obtain all the necessary information at the time of the examination. Rather, the Board finds that there is other lay and medical evidence in the record sufficient to decide the claim on the merits and will infer that any missing information from the VA examination would support the Board's assignment of a 20 percent rating as further discussed below. 

At the outset, the Board finds that the Veteran's competent and credible reports of symptoms, including his description of his flare-ups, pain, and functional loss, are consistent throughout the period on appeal and are substantiated by the Veteran's VA treatment records. Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469; Caluza, 7 Vet. App. 511-12. In evaluating the severity of the Veteran's disability, the Board finds the Court's guidance in Lyles, Mitchell, and Deluca to be particularly relevant in the evaluation of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability. See Lyles, 29 Vet. App. at 117-18 (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and citing 38 C.F.R. § 4.45); Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 36-37; DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 205-07. Thus, while a mechanical application of the ROM measurements from the December 2021 examination would arguably merit a 10 percent rating, the examiner failed to gather all of the requisite information necessary for the Board's adjudication purposes. Moreover, the lay and medical evidence shows that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability caused "additional functional loss i.e., 'the inability...to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination[,] and endurance' including as due to pain and/or other factors[.]" Lyles, 29 Vet. App. at 117-18. This evidence weighs in favor of the Board's finding that the Veteran's lay statements regarding functional loss and flare-ups and his VA medical treatment records showing the severity of his lumbar spine disability to be more probative than the ROM measurements and findings of the December 2021 VA examiner. Caluza, 7 Vet. App. 511-12.

Here, the lay and medical evidence of record shows that the Veteran experienced flare-ups of pain that impaired the use of his lumbar spine and persisted despite his use of physical therapy and chiropractic treatment, and the Board is reminded that rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions will be equitable and just as contemplated by the requirements of the law. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. This probative evidence places the evidence of record in, at the very least, approximate balance that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability more nearly approximates the criteria described in the next highest, 20 percent rating. Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781; Bufkin, 75 F.4th at 1374.

Next, after a careful analysis of the Veteran's claims file, the Board has determined that it does contain lay or medical evidence that the Veteran experienced an increase in his lumbar spine disability in the one-year period before the filing of his November 2021 claim.  On August 25, 2021, he reported that his back pain had recently increased. The Board therefore finds that there is competent, probative evidence that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability increased in the one-year period prior to the filing of his claim such that an effective date of August 25, 2021, forward for the 20 percent disability rating is merited. See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d at 984; Swain, 27 Vet. App. at 224.

In adjudicating the Veteran's increased rating claim, the Board has carefully considered the criteria of other potentially applicable DCs and finds the currently assigned DC best describes and approximates the Veteran's symptomatology. Moreover, there is no medical or lay evidence showing that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability was manifest by forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine that would result in a 40 percent rating. A rating in excess of 20 percent is therefore not warranted. 

Considering the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is in at least approximate balance that a 20 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted from August 25, 2021, forward. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; Gaston, 605 F.3d at 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Swain, 27 Vet. App. at 224; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781. In so finding, the Board has resolved all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran. Id.

3. Entitlement to TDIU prior to November 18, 2021, is denied. 

The Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU has been reasonably raised by the record during the adjudication of the increased rating claims above. See November 2021 VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability (listing lumbar spine and bilateral foot pain); Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) (holding inferred TDIU claims are part and parcel of underlying increased rating claim). The Board takes judicial notice that after the period on appeal, the Veteran was granted a TDIU rating in an October 2023 rating decision from November 18, 2021, forward. However, it is possible to grant an effective date for TDIU at a point within the year preceding the filing of an increased rating claim.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Total disability will be considered to exist where there is present an impairment of mind and body that is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340. Consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to the Veteran's age or the impairment caused by any nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.18, 4.19. Consideration shall be given in all claims to the nature of the employment and the reason for termination. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of service-connected disabilities, provided that the Veteran meets the schedular requirements. Specifically, if there is only one such disability, the disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability that is ratable at 40 percent or more and enough additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

As of September 2020, the Veteran was service connected for obstructive sleep apnea rated as 50 percent, bilateral pes planus rated as 30 percent, unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder with teeth grinding rated as 30 percent, and left shoulder impingement syndrome rated as 20 percent. The Veteran was also in receipt of 10 percent ratings for tinnitus, left knee joint pain with painful motion, left knee joint pain patellar subluxation, right elbow medical epicondylitis, right ankle collateral ligament sprain, and a 20 percent rating for his lumbar spine disability as a result of this decision. Lastly, the Veteran is in receipt of zero percent, or noncompensable ratings for his bilateral hearing loss, left eye lattice degeneration, allergic rhinitis, and erectile dysfunction disabilities. As a result of this decision, he is now in receipt of a 90 percent combined disability rating for the entirety of the appeal period and thus meets the schedular requirements for a TDIU. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

For an earlier effective date to be granted based on the one-year look back provision, it must be factually ascertainable that the Veteran's condition worsened such that he was no longer able to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due solely to impairment resulting from his service-connected disabilities within the one-year period prior to the filing of the claim.  However, if it is factually ascertainable the conditions worsen such that he was no longer able to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation more than a year before the filing of the claim then the date of claim remains the effective date.   38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Here the Veteran's November 18, 2021, VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability indicates that the date the Veteran's disabilities affected full-time employment, the date he last worked full-time, and the date he became too disabled to work was July 1, 2020.  This date is more than a year prior to filing of the November 18, 2021, claim. As such, entitlement to TDIU prior to November 18, 2021, must be denied.  In denying TDIU prior to November 18, 2021, the Board has considered the benefit-of the-doubt doctrine, however, as the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, it is not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781.
