REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2009 to March 2013.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from October 2023 and November 2023 rating decisions by the VA Regional Office (RO). 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the respective agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of left shoulder disability, right shoulder disability, bilateral foot condition, right knee disability, 

left knee disability, lumbar disability, and neck disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for tinnitus. On the November 2022 application for benefits, the Veteran stated that he experienced "a high squeal sound in both ears" that occasionally affected his ability to concentrate. The record does not indicate when the Veteran's tinnitus symptoms began.

Entitlement to service connection on a direct basis requires (1) evidence of a current nonservice-connected disability; (2) evidence of an in-service incurrence or aggravation of disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current nonservice-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases (to include tinnitus as an organic disease of the nervous system) may be presumed to be service connected if manifested as chronic in service, or to a compensable degree within a specified period of time following separation from service (one year for organic disease of the nervous system). 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). Alternatively, service connection may be established under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) by (a) evidence of (i) the existence of a chronic disease in service or during an applicable presumption period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 and (ii) present manifestations of the same chronic disease, or (b) when a chronic disease is not present during service, evidence of continuity of symptomatology. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Tinnitus, defined as a noise subjectively heard within the ears, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking, is a disorder which can be ascertained through a Veteran's own senses. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). A lay person is competent to diagnosis tinnitus. 

As an initial matter, the May 2023 rating decision found that there was a qualifying event during service because the Veteran's MOS of fire support specialist had a high probability of noise exposure. 

Here, the Veteran has described a high-pitched squeal sound in his ears. The Board finds his statement to be credible. However, in July 2023, the VA examiner determined that the Veteran did not warrant a diagnosis of tinnitus. The examiner noted that the Veteran denied any type of ringing, buzzing, cricket, etc. in ears, even though the examiner noted that the Veteran was "asked numerous times" about these symptoms. 

There is no evidence in the record to indicate when the high-pitched squealing noise that the Veteran stated he experienced began or ended. There is no evidence in the record that the Veteran first experienced tinnitus symptoms while in service. Service treatment records do not note any tinnitus symptoms.

When a claim involves a diagnosis based on purely subjective complaints, the Board is within its province to weigh the Veteran's testimony and determine whether it supports a finding of service incurrence and continued symptoms since service. Charles, supra. However, here, there is not any evidence to indicate that the Veteran's symptoms began in service nor that the Veteran currently experiences tinnitus symptoms. 

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether compensable disability ratings for the Veteran's tinnitus is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim. The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application as to this claim. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

2. Entitlement to service connection for chest scars is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for scars on his chest from a surgery in service. 

Service treatment records indicate that the Veteran underwent bilateral subcutaneous mastectomy for gynecomastia in May 2012. A follow up appointment indicated that both infra-areolar incisions were healing well.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the persuasive evidence of record shows that the Veteran's chest scars from the mastectomy for gynecomastia were incurred during active service. Accordingly, the Board finds that the criteria for service connection for chest scars is granted.

3. Entitlement to service connection for headaches is granted.

The Veteran contends that he experiences migraine headaches which began and have continued since active service. 

Certain chronic diseases (to include migraines as an organic disease of the nervous system) may be presumed to be service connected if manifested as chronic in service, or to a compensable degree within a specified period of time following separation from service (one year for organic disease of the nervous system). 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). Alternatively, service connection may be established under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) by (a) evidence of (i) the existence of a chronic disease in service or during an applicable presumption period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 and (ii) present manifestations of the same chronic disease, or (b) when a chronic disease is not present during service, evidence of continuity of symptomatology. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In a September 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his headaches and accompanying light sensitivity started during active service. The Veteran stated that his current symptoms are the same as in active service. On the headaches disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ), the examiner listed the Veteran's diagnosis as tension headaches. The examiner indicated that the Veteran was diagnosed with migraines on the medical opinion DBQ. The examiner determined that there was no nexus between the Veteran's active service (including as due to toxic risk exposure activities) and his headache disability because the Veteran had not received care in reference to chronic complaints of migraines; and because VA records were void for chronic complaints of headache or chronic treatment for migraines.

Here, the Veteran is competent to report the nature and duration of his headache symptoms as he has personal knowledge, derived from his own senses, of what is being attested; "[c]ompetent testimony is thus limited to that which the witness has actually observed, and is within the realm of his personal knowledge." Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 471 (1994). Although medical evidence is generally necessary for a nexus to service, lay evidence can be sufficient to show continuity of symptoms after service, as a foundation for a nexus opinion, or to link chronic in-service symptoms to the same diagnosed current disability, or as a substitute for a nexus. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

The Board finds the Veteran's statements that his headaches began during active service and continue to this day to be credible and assigns them probative value.

In making this decision, the Board has considered the negative evidence of record, including the negative nexus opinion of the September 2023 VA examiner stating that there was no relationship between the Veteran's headaches and active service. 

After careful consideration of the evidence of record, and resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection are met. The medical evidence shows a diagnosis of migraines. Furthermore, the Veteran has reported a history of headaches that began in active service and continue to this day. The Veteran is competent to report any history of observable symptoms, and, in this case, the Board finds no reason to doubt the veracity of the Veteran's reported history. As there is a diagnosis of migraines (a chronic disease enumerated under 38 U.S.C. § 1101) and credible, competent evidence of continuity of symptomatology, the current headache disability is considered to have been incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(b), 3.309(a).

4. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD to include depression and anxiety condition is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for PTSD. 

The Veteran missed his November 2023 VA examination. Accordingly, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim in the subsequent November 2023 rating decision on the basis of the missed examination pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

In such a situation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a) provides that, when entitlement to a benefit cannot be established without a current VA examination or reexamination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination or reexamination, action shall be taken in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b) or (c) as appropriate. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b), when a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with an original compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. 

Consequently, as the Veteran did not attend a scheduled VA examination in connection with this original compensation claim, the Board will adjudicate the pending service connection claim based on the evidence of record. 

A service connection claim must be accompanied by evidence which establishes that the claimant currently has a disability. Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 144 (1992); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Service connection is not warranted in the absence of proof of current disability.

Here, the Veteran was diagnosed with major depression during active service. The record does not contain any evidence that the Veteran currently has a mental health disability. 

Consequently, service connection for such disorder is not warranted. In reaching such decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application). 

As stated above, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim and submit additional evidence, such as current symptoms or diagnoses, if he so chooses.

5. Entitlement to service connection for left shin splints is denied.

6. Entitlement to service connection for right shin splints is denied.

5.-6.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for bilateral shin splints.

A service connection claim must be accompanied by evidence which establishes that the claimant currently has a disability. Rideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 144 (1992); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Service connection is not warranted in the absence of proof of current disability.

The Veteran was afforded an in-person VA examination in July 2023. The VA examiner determined that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of right or left shin splints. There are no medical treatment records evidencing a current diagnosis of right or left shin splints. On his November 2022 application for benefits, the Veteran described his shin splints in service stating that "I would sometimes get gold ball size bumps on my shins." However, the Veteran did not indicate that he currently experiences shin splint symptoms.

The Board finds the VA examination to be more reliable than the Veteran's statement on the claim for benefits as the determination was made by a medical professional and for the purpose of identifying current disabilities.

There is no competent evidence in the record that the Veteran has a diagnosis of right or left shin splints. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current disability of right or left shin splints. Consequently, service connection for such disorders on a direct or secondary basis is not warranted. In reaching such decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, supra; Lynch, supra.

REASONS FOR REMAND

7. Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder strain is remanded.

8. Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder disability is remanded.

9. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral foot condition is remanded.

10. Entitlement to service connection for right knee strain is remanded. 

11. Entitlement to service connection for left knee strain is remanded.

12. Entitlement to service connection for lumbar strain is remanded.

13. Entitlement to service connection for cervical strain is remanded.

After a review of the record, the Board finds that the claims must be remanded to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Initially, the AOJ obtained medical opinions in July 2023; however, these medical opinions are inadequate. The examiner did not provide any well-reasoned medical nexus opinions, nor did the examiner discuss the Veteran's lay statements regarding his experiences during active service that he believes resulted in his claimed disabilities. Additionally, for right shoulder disability and bilateral foot disability, the examiner determined that there was no diagnosis and based the negative nexus opinion on a lack of diagnosis; however, the examiner noted pain and functional loss for both claimed disabilities. 

VA has a duty to ensure that any medical examination or opinion it provides is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). A medical opinion is adequate where it is based upon consideration of the full medical history and describes a disability in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation will be fully informed. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Forward the claims file to an examiner[s] for opinions regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's left shoulder strain, right shoulder disability to include pain with functional loss, right knee strain, lumbar strain, left knee strain, cervical strain, and bilateral foot disability to include pain with functional loss. 

The examiner is to assume as true, for the purpose of providing the opinions, that the Veteran's description of what occurred in service and symptoms since then. If the examiner determines that a new examination would be beneficial, one is to be provided.
