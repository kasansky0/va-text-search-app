ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

2.  Right ear hearing loss for VA compensation purposes is not shown. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1982 to June 1994.

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In October 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a March 2021 rating decision. In November 2021 the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2021 rating decision. 

In the April 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2021 AOJ rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

In its November 2021 HLR decision, the AOJ styled the claim as a single claim of service connection for bilateral hearing loss. The Board has restyled the issue as two separate claims for left ear and right ear hearing loss, respectively, in accordance with Boggs v. Peake, 520 F.3d 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2008). See also Murphy v. Wilkie, 983 F.3d 1313, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

1. Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss

2. Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss

The Veteran asserts that he has left ear and right ear hearing loss, which was incurred in, aggravated by, or are otherwise attributable to, his active-duty service.  

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. A veteran seeking compensation under these provisions must establish three elements: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service." Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 under the following circumstances: (1) where a chronic disease or injury is shown in service and subsequent manifestations of the same disease or injury are shown at a later date unless clearly attributable to an intercurrent cause; or (2) where there is continuity of symptomatology since service; or (3) by showing that the disorder manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of the date of separation from service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307.

Hearing loss is recognized as a "chronic" disease under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); therefore, the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, and 3.309 apply. See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1131 (Fed. Cir. 2013); See also Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant. Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021).

Left Ear Hearing Loss

In the November 2021 HLR rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made favorable findings that the Veteran had a diagnosis of left ear hearing loss and that he had been exposed to hazardous noise during his active service, specifically, his military occupational specialties of Small Arms Repairman and Marksmanship Instructor and his receipt of the Combat Action Ribbon for service during Operation Desert Storm. The Board will not disturb these favorable legal findings. 

Additionally, there is competent evidence of actual hearing loss during the Veteran's active service. In the February 1994 Report of Medical History for separation from active service, the Veteran initially noted that he had not had hearing loss and did not have it at that time, however, he, or presumably the clinician, changed his answer to indicate that the Veteran didn't know whether he had hearing loss. This uncertainty about whether he had had, or currently had hearing loss provides some indication to the Board the Veteran experienced some effects of hazardous noise exposure. Furthermore, at the October 2020 VA Hearing Loss and Tinnitus examination, he reported that his hearing loss began in 1982, which is during his service. Therefore, a current disability and an in-service incurrence of a disease or injury are established. 

The remaining determination is whether the veteran's current left ear hearing loss either stems directly from his in-service hazardous noise exposure or meets the criteria for presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, and 3.309. 

At the October 2020 VA Hearing Loss and Tinnitus examination, the examiner provided a negative etiological opinion regarding a possible relationship between the Veteran's left ear hearing loss and his in-service hazardous noise exposure. As rationale, the examiner stated that there was no report of complaints or treatment for hearing loss in the Veteran's service treatment records or at separation, and there was a lack of a significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds beyond test variability from entrance to separation. The Veteran reported that his hearing loss began during service. However, the examiner failed to elicit information about the course of the disease over time. The examiner noted that the Veteran had not had any pertinent occupational, recreational or social noise exposure post-service and did not have a family or medical history of hearing loss. The examiner then acknowledged that the relationship between noise, auditory damage and hearing loss is well-established, but stated that that was not sufficient to establish a nexus between the hazardous noise exposure and hearing loss. However, the Veteran also reported that his tinnitus onset in service, and the examiner stated that because excessive noise exposure is known to cause tinnitus, it is at least least likely as not that the tinnitus is a result of military noise exposure. The examiner did not provide an adequate explanation as to why, when the Veteran reported that both his hearing loss and tinnitus began during service, and the there is a known relationship between excessive noise exposure and the development of both diseases, that only the Veteran's tinnitus is attributable to the hazardous noise exposure. 

There are a number of other issues that the examiner did not acknowledge and/or address, such as why the Veteran's hearing loss is much worse in his left ear than in his right ear, and whether or not his military occupational specialties or his combat experience could account for that, or what is the more likely cause of the Veteran's left ear hearing loss. Furthermore, the lack of documented hearing loss while in service is not fatal to a claim for service connection. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). The examiner also did not consider the possibility of delayed-onset hearing loss. For these reasons, the Board affords this negative etiological opinion low probative value. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning); Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012).

The Veteran had another VA hearing loss and tinnitus examination in February 2021. The examiner also provided a negative etiological opinion regarding the relationship between the Veteran's left ear hearing loss and his in-service hazardous noise exposure. The Veteran reported that his hearing loss began in-service, but the examiner failed to elicit information from the Veteran about the course of his hearing loss over time. The Veteran reported that he currently could not hear out of his left ear. The examiner stated that the type of noise the Veteran was exposed to during service could result in noise-induced hearing loss. As rationale for the negative etiological opinion, the examiner relied primarily upon a lack of evidence of a threshold shift in hearing acuity from the start of the Veteran's active service to his separation from service. However, as previously noted, the absence of documented hearing loss while in service is not fatal to a claim for service connection. Ledford at 89 (1992). Furthermore, the examiner also did not address the possibility of delayed onset hearing loss. The examiner noted that the Veteran had continued noise exposure after service, but used hearing protection, which negates any finding of an incurrent cause of the hearing loss. Considering the the foregoing, and the lack of evidence of an incurrent cause of the Veteran's left ear hearing loss, and the fact that the examiner could not identify a more likely cause or a reasonable explanation as to why the Veteran's hearing loss is much worse in his left ear than in his right, the Board finds that the opinion does not contain sufficient reasoning, and affords the negative etiology opinion low probative value. Nieves-Rodriguez at 304); Acevedo at 294.

Resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that there is conceded and/or competent evidence of in-service acoustic trauma, in-service hearing loss, and hearing loss that continuously worsened (and did not happen overnight), without an incurrent cause, since service. Therefore, service connection for left ear hearing loss is presumed to have been incurred in service, and the claim is granted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

Because the Board is granting service connection on a presumptive basis based on continuous symptoms of left ear hearing loss since separation, because there is not positive etiological medical opinion, all other theories of service connection are rendered moot.

Right Ear Hearing Loss

The Veteran does not have a current right ear hearing loss disability that meets the requirements for service connection. 

Hearing impairment for VA purposes, will be considered a disability for purposes of eligibility for VA benefits when: (1) the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels (dBs) or greater; or (2) the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hz are 26 dBs or greater; or (3) when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Here, the medical evidence does not show that the Veteran has right ear hearing loss for VA compensation purposes. At the October 2020 VA examination, the auditory threshold in the 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz were, respectively, 5, 15, 15, 15, and 20 with a speech recognition score of 98 percent. At the February 2021 VA examination, the auditory threshold in the 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz were, respectively, 10, 20, 10, 15, and 20 with a speech recognition score of 96 percent. 

The Veteran has reported his exposure to hazardous noise from a variety of sources and this was conceded and he is certainly credible in this regard. However, although he is competent to report his service history and hearing loss symptoms, he is not competent to determine whether his right ear hearing loss meet the criteria to be considered a disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 for VA compensation purposes.

The testing results of the October 2020 and February 2021 VA Hearing Loss examinations are highly probative because the examiners indicated that the pure tone test results were valid for rating purposes and that the use of word recognition scores was appropriate for the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The evidence is not in approximate balance between that favoring the claim and against the claim for right ear hearing loss because two VA Hearing Loss examinations did not show right ear hearing loss for VA purposes. The Veteran has not submitted competent evidence that shows right ear hearing loss for VA purposes. There is no reasonable doubt to resolve, and the claim is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021).
