Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 25, 2022, for the grant of a 40 percent rating for fibromyalgia is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 22, 2023, for the grant of a 50 percent rating for sinus headaches/migraine headaches is denied.  

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for chronic sinusitis is denied.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claim for service connection for chronic sinusitis with multiple sinus surgeries was denied in a November 2008 rating decision but, because relevant official service department records were later associated with the claims file, it did not become final.  

2. The Veteran's claim for service connection for Parkinson's disease was denied in a November 2008 rating decision.  She was notified of this decision, did not timely disagree with it, and new and material evidence was not obtained within one year of it, and it became final.

3. VA received a claim for service connection for Parkinson's disease on September 28, 2015.  The May 2023 rating decision eventually resulting from that claim granted service connection for Parkinson's disease, with an effective date of September 28, 2015.  There is no indication of an attempt to reopen the claim between November 2008 and September 28, 2015.

4. There is no indication of a claim of service connection for a psychiatric disability prior to September 28, 2015.  

5. The Veteran's claim for service connection for fibromyalgia was denied in a November 2001 rating decision but, because relevant official service department records were later associated with the claims file, it did not become final.  

6. The Veteran's claim for service connection for fibromyalgia was granted in a November 2017 rating decision, with a 10 percent rating on and after March 28, 2017.  She was notified of this decision and timely disagreed with both the rating and effective date, but did not perfect a substantive appeal or submit new and material evidence within one year of the rating decision or 60 days of the Statement of the Case (SOC) that was mailed in February 2020, and it became final.

7. VA received notice of the Veteran's intent to file a claim on July 25, 2022 and received a claim for an increased rating for fibromyalgia on October 13, 2022.  There is no indication of an attempt to claim an increased rating for fibromyalgia between November 2017 and July 25, 2022 and it is not factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to July 25, 2022.    

8. The Veteran's claim for service connection for migraines was denied in a November 2001 rating decision but, because relevant official service department records were later associated with the claims file, it did not become final.  

9. The Veteran's claim for service connection for sinus headaches/migraine headaches was granted in an August 2021 rating decision, with a noncompensable rating on and after September 28, 2015.  She was notified of this decision, did not timely disagree with it, and new and material evidence was not obtained within one year of it, and it became final.

10. VA received a claim for an increased rating for sinus headaches/migraine headaches on May 22, 2023.  There is no indication of an attempt to claim an increased rating for headaches between August 2021 and May 22, 2023 and it is not factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to May 22, 2023.    

11. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's chronic sinusitis manifested as three or more incapacitating episodes per year, but not as radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis or near constant sinusitis.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. With resolution of reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to an effective date of July 8, 2008 for the grant of service connection for chronic sinusitis have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156, 3.400.  

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to September 28, 2015, for the grant of service connection for Parkinson's disease are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5108, 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.400, 19.52, 20.1103.  

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to September 28, 2015, for the grant of service connection for PTSD are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5108, 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.400, 19.52, 20.1103.  

4. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to July 25, 2022 for the grant of a 40 percent rating for fibromyalgia are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5108, 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.400, 19.52, 20.1103.  

5. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to May 22, 2023 for the grant of a 50 percent rating for sinus headaches/migraine headaches are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5108, 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.400, 19.52, 20.1103.  

6. During the period on appeal, the criteria for a rating in excess of 30 percent for chronic sinusitis were not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.21, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6511.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from June 1990 to August 1990 and from November 1990 to April 1991.

With regard to the PTSD claim, the rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

With regard to the fibromyalgia claim, the rating decision on appeal was issued later in December 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the AMA applies.  

With regard to the Parkinson's disease claim, the rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the AMA applies.  

With regard to the headache claim, the rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the AMA applies.  

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the effective dates assigned in the decisions listed above.  In September 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior decision with regard to each claim.  

With regard to the sinusitis claim, the rating decisions on appeal were issued in November 2023 (for the disability rating) and December 2023 (for the effective date) and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the AMA applies.

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal with regard to each claim, including the ones subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

Evidence was added to the claims file more than 90 days after the Notice of Disagreement, which was during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  Evidence was also added to the claims file by VA during the 90 day window that was not submitted by the Veteran.  As the Board is deciding the claims, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

With regard to the Parkinson's disease, PTSD, and sinusitis claims, the Veteran submitted her claim on September 28, 2015 as a fully developed claim (FDC) pursuant to VA's program to expedite VA claims.  With regard to the fibromyalgia claim, the Veteran submitted her claim on March 28, 2017 as an FDC.  With regard to the headache claim, the Veteran submitted her claim on May 22, 2023 as an FDC.  Under this framework, a claim is submitted in a "fully developed" status, limiting the need for further development of the claim by VA.  The notice that accompanies the FDC form informs the Veteran of what evidence is required to substantiate a claim and VA's respective duties for obtaining evidence.  See VA Form 21-526EZ.  

With regard to the duty to assist, the Veteran's VA, private, and Department of Defense medical treatment records have been obtained. 

Within the time period for which the Board may consider evidence, the Veteran was most recently afforded VA examinations for PTSD in October 2022, for fibromyalgia in November 2022, for Parkinson's disease in January 2023, for headaches in June 2023, and for sinusitis in August 2023.  These VA examinations are adequate with regard to the claims being decided below because they were based upon consideration of the Veteran's pertinent medical history, her lay assertions and current complaints, and because they describe her PTSD, fibromyalgia, Parkinson's disease, headache, and sinusitis symptoms in detail sufficient to allow the Board to make fully informed determinations.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303 (2007) (citing Ardison v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?405, 407 (1994)). 

In multiple statements, most recently in December 2024, the Veteran attempts to generally raise the issue of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in various prior decisions.  With the exception of a February 2018 rating decision finding no CUE in a November 2001 rating decision with regard to the fibromyalgia claim, the AOJ has not adjudicated the issue of CUE.  The February 2018 rating decision is not on appeal before the Board.  

If there is no AOJ adjudication of a CUE motion raised by the Veteran, the Board cannot address the issue in the first instance.  The motion seeking revision on the basis of CUE is completely separate from the claims on appeal for earlier effective dates and an increased rating and must be adjudicated by the AOJ in the first instance.  Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006) (explaining that 38 U.S.C. § 5109A requires that a request for revision of a final AOJ decision on the basis of CUE be submitted to the AOJ for initial adjudication).  An assertion of CUE is a motion or a request, not a theory of entitlement that can be considered part of another claim. See, e.g., Hillyard v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 343, 355 (2011).  

If the Veteran seeks revision in prior decisions on the basis of CUE, she must submit a motion to that effect to the AOJ.  Any claim of CUE must be pled with specificity.  See Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  This specific allegation must assert more than merely disagreement with how the facts of the case were weighed or evaluated.  Persuasive reasons must be given as to why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error.  

Effective Dates

Unless specifically provided otherwise by statute, the effective date of an award for compensation benefits based on (1) an original claim, (2) a claim reopened after final adjudication, or (3) a claim for increase, is the date VA received the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999) (holding that the effective date of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but rather, on the date the application was filed with VA).  

With regard to a claim for increase, the effective date can be up to one year earlier than the date of the claim if it is factually ascertainable, based on all evidence of record, that an increase in disability occurred within one year of the date of claim.  38 C.F.R. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  If the increase occurred more than one year prior, the increase is effective the date of the claim.  Gaston, 605 F. 3d at 980; see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

For initial rating claims and increased rating claims, "the effective date can be no earlier than the date it was factually ascertainable" that a veteran's disability was diagnosed or worsened.  Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 n. 4 (2015).  The effective date should not be "assigned mechanically" as of the date of an examination.  Id. at 224.  There must be a factual basis for choosing an earlier date.  

In general, rating decisions that are not timely appealed are final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.  In the legacy appeal system, to be timely, a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) must be filed within one year of the date VA mails notice of a rating decision to the Veteran; a substantive appeal must be filed within 60 days from the date VA mails notice of a Statement of the Case (SOC) to the Veteran or within one year of the mailing of the rating decision, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 19.52.  

1. Chronic Sinusitis - Effective Date

The Veteran contends that she should be granted an effective date earlier than September 28, 2015 for service connection for chronic sinusitis.

VA received the Veteran's original claim for service connection for sinus surgeries on July 8, 2008.  VA denied the Veteran's claim (as chronic sinusitis with multiple sinus surgeries) in a November 2008 rating decision.  The basis for the denial was that there was no evidence of an in-service injury or illness or a nexus to service.  The Veteran did not submit an NOD or new and material evidence within one year of this decision.

However, in August 2017, additional Department of Defense treatment records were associated with the claims file.  "Notwithstanding any other section in this part, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA received or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim."? 38?C.F.R. §?3.156?(c)(1).  "Relevant" means the evidence "must tend to prove or disprove a material fact." AZ v. Shinseki, 731 F.3d 1303, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  The records include treatment for sinusitis in November 1997, prior to the November 2008 rating decision.  Because the November 2008 denial was based in part on a lack of a nexus to service, the existence of sinusitis between separation from active duty service and the original claim date is relevant to the claim.  The Board finds that reconsideration of the November 2008 rating decision is therefore warranted. 

The Veteran has submitted evidence that she had chronic sinusitis at the time of her July 8, 2008 claim and VA has since conceded a nexus to active duty service.  Entitlement to an effective date of July 8, 2008 for the grant of service connection for chronic sinusitis is therefore warranted.  

2. Parkinson's Disease - Effective Date

The Veteran contends that she should be granted an effective date earlier than September 28, 2015, for service connection for Parkinson's disease.  

The Veteran first submitted a claim for service connection for Parkinson's-like symptoms on July 8, 2008.  VA denied the Veteran's claim (as Parkinson's disease) in a November 2008 rating decision.  The basis for the denial was that none of the elements of service connection were met.  The Veteran did not submit an NOD or new and material evidence within one year of this decision.

As noted above, Department of Defense records that predated the November 2008 rating decision were associated with the claims file after the decision.  However, because none of those records reference treatment for Parkinson's disease, they are not relevant to this claim.

In addition, "VA has a long history of considering documents that were not literally before an examiner to be constructively part of a claimant's record." Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  Evidence is constructively received if it is generated by VA and "relevant and reasonably connected" to the Veteran's claim.  See id. at 1354.  The most common example of VA-generated documents are VA treatment records.  Here, there is nothing to indicate that the Veteran received treatment with VA for Parkinson's disease during the one-year appeal period and the Veteran did not submit any additional evidence pertaining to this claim within the one-year appeal period.

Therefore, the November 2008 rating decision is final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 19.52, 20.1103.  

The Board has reviewed the claims file for any document, submitted after the November 2008 rating decision but before the Veteran's September 28, 2015, claim, that could be considered a claim for service connection for Parkinson's disease and has found none.  Moreover, the Veteran does not assert that she filed an informal or formal claim during that time.  

When a Veteran has a claim to reopen or readjudicate, she "cannot obtain an effective date earlier than the reopened claim's application date."  Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d 1333, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (indicating that "no matter how [the Veteran] tries to define 'effective date,' the simple fact is that, absent a showing of CUE, he cannot receive disability payments for a time frame earlier than the application date of his claim to reopen, even with new evidence supporting an earlier disability date").

In order for the Veteran to be awarded an effective date based on the claim that was denied in the prior rating decision, she has to show CUE in the prior denial as a collateral attack.  Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332, 340 (1995).  As stated above, if the Veteran is alleging CUE in the November 2008 rating decision, she must submit a motion to that effect to the AOJ.  

For those reasons, the Board concludes that the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date earlier than September 28, 2015, for service connection for Parkinson's disease, which is the date of the claim that eventually led to the grant of service connection.

3. PTSD - Effective Date

The appellant contends that she should be granted an effective date earlier than September 28, 2015 for service connection for PTSD.  

The Veteran first submitted a claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD on September 28, 2015.  The Board has reviewed the claims file for any document, submitted before the Veteran's September 28, 2015, that could be considered a claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability.  The Board has found no communication from the Veteran to VA that could be construed as a formal or informal claim of entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability prior to the claim submitted on September 28, 2015.  Moreover, the Veteran does not assert that she filed an informal or formal claim for a psychiatric disability during that time.

Because the effective date must be either the claim date or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, and service connection is already effective as of the claim date, it is unnecessary for the Board to determine when entitlement arose.  The Board therefore concludes that the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date earlier than September 28, 2015, for service connection for PTSD, which is the day VA received the claim that led to the grant of service connection.

4. Fibromyalgia - Effective Date

The Veteran contends that she should be granted an effective date earlier than July 25, 2022 for a 40 percent rating for fibromyalgia.

VA received the Veteran's original claim for service connection for fibromyalgia on July 3, 2000.  VA denied the Veteran's claim in a November 2001 rating decision.  The basis for the denial was that none of the elements of service connection were met.  The Veteran submitted an NOD later in November 2001 but did not perfect an appeal within one year of the rating decision or within 60 days of the March 2002 SOC.

However, in August 2017, additional Department of Defense treatment records were associated with the claims file.  The records include a diagnosis of fibromyalgia in February 1995, prior to the November 2001 rating decision.  Because the November 2001 denial was based in part on a lack of a current disability, a diagnosis of fibromyalgia is relevant to the claim.  The Board finds that reconsideration of the November 2001 rating decision was therefore warranted at the time of the August 2017 submission of additional records. 

That does not, however, end the Board's inquiry.  VA received a subsequent claim from the Veteran for service connection for fibromyalgia on March 28, 2017.  In a November 2017 rating decision, VA granted the claim and assigned a 10 percent rating on and after March 28, 2017.  The Veteran submitted an NOD with regard to the rating and effective date in December 2017 but did not perfect an appeal within one year of the rating decision or within 60 days of the February 2020 SOC.  That decision became final and not subject to revision on the same factual basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 19.52, 20.1103.  

Therefore, to the extent that the November 2001 rating decision was not final at the time of the November 2017 rating decision, that is moot because the November 2017 rating decision has become final.  In order for the Veteran to be awarded an effective date based on the claim that was denied in the prior rating decision, she has to show CUE in the prior denial as a collateral attack.  Flash, 8 Vet. App. at 340.  As stated above, if the Veteran is alleging CUE in the November 2001 rating decision, she must submit a motion to that effect to the AOJ, and the Board notes that a prior such motion was denied in a February 2018 rating decision and not appealed.

VA received notice of the Veteran's intent to file a claim on July 25, 2022, and then a claim for an increased rating for fibromyalgia on October 13, 2022, which led to the rating decision on appeal.  If VA receives a completed claim within one year of receipt of the intent to file, VA will consider the completed claim filed as of the date the intent to file was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.  

The Board has reviewed the claims file for any document, submitted after the November 2017 rating decision but before the Veteran's July 25, 2022 notice of intent to file, that could be considered a claim for an increased rating for fibromyalgia.  Lalonde, 12 Vet. App. at 381.  The Board has found none.  Moreover, the Veteran does not assert that she filed a claim during that time.  

An effective date earlier than July 25, 2022 for a 40 percent rating for fibromyalgia is therefore only warranted if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to July 25, 2022.  The Veteran has not reported that her fibromyalgia symptoms worsened at any specific point during this period and her treatment records do not establish a factually ascertainable increase in disability during this period.  

For those reasons, the Board concludes that the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date earlier than July 25, 2022, for a 40 percent rating for fibromyalgia, which is the date of notice of the Veteran's intent to file the claim that led to the grant of an increased rating.

5. Sinus Headaches/Migraine Headaches - Effective Date

The Veteran contends that she should be granted an effective date earlier than May 22, 2023 for a 50 percent rating for sinus headaches/migraine headaches.

VA received the Veteran's original claim for service connection for migraines on July 3, 2000.  VA denied the Veteran's claim in a November 2001 rating decision.  The basis for the denial was that none of the elements of service connection were met.  The Veteran submitted an NOD later in November 2001 but did not perfect an appeal within one year of the rating decision or within 60 days of the March 2002 SOC.

However, in August 2017, additional Department of Defense treatment records were associated with the claims file.  The records include a report of headaches in November 1997, prior to the November 2001 rating decision.  Because the November 2001 denial was based in part on a lack of a nexus to service, the existence of headaches between separation from active duty service and the original claim date is relevant to the claim.  The Board finds that reconsideration of the November 2001 rating decision was therefore warranted at the time of the August 2017 submission of additional records. 

That does not, however, end the Board's inquiry.  VA received a subsequent claim from the Veteran for service connection for headaches on September 28, 2015.  In an August 2021 rating decision in response to a July 2021 Board decision granting service connection for sinus headaches/migraine headaches, VA assigned a noncompensable rating on and after September 28, 2015.  The Veteran did not submit an NOD or new and material evidence within one year of this decision.  That decision became final and not subject to revision on the same factual basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 19.52, 20.1103.  

Therefore, to the extent that the November 2001 rating decision was not final at the time of the August 2021 rating decision, that is moot because the August 2021 rating decision has become final.  In order for the Veteran to be awarded an effective date based on the claim that was denied in the prior rating decision, she has to show CUE in the prior denial as a collateral attack.  Flash, 8 Vet. App. at 340.  As stated above, if the Veteran is alleging CUE in the November 2001 rating decision, she must submit a motion to that effect to the AOJ.

On May 22, 2023, VA received the Veteran's claim for service connection for temporomandibular joint (TMJ), which the AOJ interpreted to include a claim for an increased rating for sinus headaches/migraine headaches.  This led to the rating decision on appeal.  

The Board has reviewed the claims file for any document, submitted after the August 2021 rating decision but before the Veteran's May 22, 2023 claim, that could be considered a claim for an increased rating for headaches.  Lalonde, 12 Vet. App. at 381.  The Board has found none.  Moreover, the Veteran does not assert that she filed a claim during that time.  

An effective date earlier than May 22, 2023 for a 50 percent rating for sinus headaches/migraine headaches is therefore only warranted if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to May 22, 2023.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for headaches in June 2023.  During that examination, she reported that she had left her employment due to her headaches.  In a September 2023 rating decision granting a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) on and after January 11, 2022, VA found that the Veteran's employment ended on January 10, 2022.  

Therefore, even if the evidence described above establishes a factually ascertainable increase in disability, the increase began over a year prior to the date of VA's receipt of the Veteran's May 22, 2023 claim.  It therefore cannot be a basis for granting an increased rating prior to the date of the claim.  For those reasons, the Board concludes that the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date earlier than May 22, 2023, for a 50 percent rating for sinus headaches/migraine headaches, which is the date of the claim that led to the grant of an increased rating.

6. Chronic Sinusitis - Increased Rating

The Veteran contends that her chronic sinusitis warrants a higher rating than that currently assigned.  It is currently rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6511, for chronic ethmoid sinusitis, with a 30 percent rating on and after September 28, 2015.  The full period of service connection is on appeal.

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate Diagnostic Codes identify the various disabilities. 38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized. 38?C.F.R. §?4.1. 

"Staged" ratings are appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505 (2007).  Given the nature of the present claim for a higher initial evaluation, the Board has considered all evidence of severity from the effective date for the award of service connection.  Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119 (1999). 

Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned. 38?C.F.R. §?4.7. 

Diagnostic Code 6511 provides for rating under the General Formula for Sinusitis (General Formula).  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6511.  For three or more incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting, a 30 percent rating is warranted.  Id.  Following radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis, or with near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and tenderness of the affected sinus and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries, a 50 percent rating is warranted.  Id.  An incapacitating episode of sinusitis means one that requires bed rest and treatment by a physician.  Id.

The Veteran's treatment records note repeated surgeries involving her sinuses prior to and during the period on appeal, including mucus removal from the maxillary sinuses during a maxillary osteotomy in October 1995, revision endoscopic sinus surgery in May 2008, and a bilateral maxillary extended antrostomy, right anterior and posterior ethmoidectomy, right sphenoidotomy, and right frontal sinusotomy in February 2017.  

During an August 2019 hearing before a Veterans Law Judge with regard to her claim for service connection, the Veteran testified that her surgeries had brought relief "to an extent" but that she knew "what to stay away from" and "definitely [had] to stay away from certain things."  She also testified that she kept "steroids if in the event that [she got] sick again."

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for sinusitis in August 2023.  The Veteran reported sinus pressure in her maxillary sinuses, ethmoid, and frontal sinuses, as well as daily headaches (as noted above, her sinus headaches are separately service-connected).  She added that she could not bend over and come back up because the sinus pressure caused her to feel that she would pass out.  She reported using nasal sprays and rinses daily.  The clinician found that she had had four non-incapacitating episodes of sinusitis in the preceding 12 months and three or more incapacitating episodes.  The clinician also found that her prior surgeries had been endoscopic, not radical.  The clinician found that the Veteran's sinusitis would have an impact on her ability to work but attributed this mainly to the accompanying headaches.  The Veteran reported that, when she has episodes of sinusitis, she has fatigue on the first day, goes for "a shot for the facial pain and get[s] antibiotics" on the next day, and then has nausea and vomiting on the third day.  

The most persuasive evidence shows that the schedular criteria for a rating in excess of 30 percent for chronic sinusitis are not met.  The August 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran's sinus surgeries were not radical and the Veteran has not contended otherwise.  In addition, during the period on appeal, the evidence indicates that the Veteran's sinusitis, though it caused multiple incapacitating and non-incapacitating episodes, was episodic, not nearly constant.  As the criteria for a 50 percent rating require radical surgery or near constant sinusitis, a rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted.   

The Board has also taken the Veteran's lay statements into account.  The Veteran is competent to report her own observations with regard to the symptomatology of her chronic sinusitis.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Her statements are also credible.  However, as stated above, nothing in the Veteran's lay statements indicates that her chronic sinusitis is near constant instead of episodic.  

The Board also notes that the Veteran reports taking medication for her chronic sinusitis.  The United States Supreme Court (Court) has held that "the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria."  Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).  The Board is required " to discount beneficial medication effects when relevant rating criteria do not specifically contemplate medication use."  Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, at *1 (Mar. 12, 2025).

The Veteran reports that she takes medication and that it has beneficial effects.  Diagnostic Code 6511 does not specifically contemplate medication use.  The Board is therefore required to discount those effects.  However, the pain medication and antibiotics the Veteran reports taking are themselves episodic and therefore not a basis for finding that symptoms would be near constant without them.  The record also contains nothing to indicate that, without daily use of nasal spray, her sinusitis would be nearly constant.
