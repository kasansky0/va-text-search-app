DOCKET NO. 240827-467865
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

A total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service connected disabilities render her unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.340, 3.341, 4.1, 4.15, 4.16, 4.18, 4.19, 4.25.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from January 1979 to January 1988, and additional National Guard service.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2023 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Veteran submitted VA Form 10182 in August 2024, electing the direct Board review option.  The Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision.

The Veteran seeks TDIU based on her combined service-connected disabilities.  See July 2023 VA Form 21-4138.  

Total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340.  If the total rating is based on a disability or combination of disabilities for which the Schedule for Rating Disabilities provides an evaluation of less than 100 percent, it must be determined that the service-connected disabilities are sufficient to produce unemployability without regard to advancing age.  38 C.F.R. § 3.341. 

If the schedular rating is less than total, a total disability evaluation may be assigned based on individual unemployability if a Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disability, provided that he has one service-connected disability rated at 60 percent or higher; or two or more service-connected disabilities, with one disability rated at 40 percent or higher and the combined rating is 70 percent or higher.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  

Here, the Veteran is in receipt of VA disability compensation for migraine headaches, evaluated as 50 percent disabling; depressive disorder, evaluated as 50 percent disabling; tinnitus, evaluated as 10 percent disabling; a pelvic scar, evaluated as noncompensably disabling; and sexual arousal dysfunction, evaluated as noncompensably disabling.  Her combined evaluation for compensation is 80 percent.  As such, she meets the objective criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 for consideration of TDIU.

Moreover, the Board concludes that TDIU is warranted in this case.  In this regard, the Veteran's July 2023 statement competently describes the cumulative effects of her disabilities on her occupational functioning.  Additionally, a June 2023 report by P.D., APRN, MSN CEN, CPEN, TCRN, FNP-BC, indicates her professional opinion that the Veteran' service-connected disabilities rendered her unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment.  This opinion was supported with a careful recitation of the relevant evidence and an explanation of the medical principles underlying the provider's conclusions.  In weighing the lay and medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran is rendered unable to obtain and maintain a substantially gainful occupation as the result of her service-connected disabilities.  As such, entitlement to TDIU is warranted.
