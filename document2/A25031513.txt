ORDER

Entitlement to an extension of temporary total evaluation beyond November 1, 2023 for the Veteran's left knee strain with patellar fracture status post tendon repair (hereinafter post-surgical left knee disability) is denied.

From July 18, 2023 to August 17, 2023, a disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for service-connected left knee strain with patellar fracture (limitation of extension) is granted.

From November 1, 2023 to January 17, 2024, a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for post-surgical left knee disability is denied.

From September 27, 2022 to December 20, 2023, a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected left knee strain with patellar fracture (hereinafter left knee strain) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The medical evidence of record during the period on appeal demonstrates that for the period after November 1, 2023, the Veteran did not experience severe postoperative residuals, requiring immobilization therapy, the necessity of house confinement, incompletely healed surgical wounds, the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches, or demonstrate another need for further post-surgical convalescence.

2. From July 18, 2023 to August 17, 2023, the Veteran's service-connected left knee disability worsened due to injury and was manifest by extension limited to no worse than 20 degrees.

3. From November 1, 2023 to January 17, 2024, the Veteran's post-surgical left knee disability manifest in a successful left quadricep ligament tear repair that did not require issuance of assistive devices for ambulation with patellar instability

4. From September 27, 2022 to December 20, 2023, the Veteran's left knee strain manifested in painful motion, limitation of flexion to 80 degrees, and limitation of extension to 0 degrees. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an extension of a temporary total rating for left quadricep tendon repair surgery based on the need for convalescence beyond November 1, 2023, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.30.

2. From July 18, 2023 to August 17, 2023, the criteria for a disability rating of 30 percent, and no higher, for left disability (limitation of motion) has been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261.

3. From November 1, 2023 to January 17, 2024, the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 30 percent based upon unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability of the post-surgical left knee have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257.

4. From September 27, 2022 to December 20, 2023, the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent based upon limitation of flexion of the left knee have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 ; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the U.S. Navy from June 2001 to December 2009. 

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in December 2023 (left knee strain and post-surgical left knee disability evaluations) and January 2024 (temporary evaluation from August 18, 2023 to October 31, 2023 and effective date of 20 percent evaluation for post-surgical left knee disability from November 1, 2023). Both constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

By way of background, in a March 2022 rating decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), the Veteran was awarded service connection for left knee strain with patellar fracture (herein referred to as left knee strain), pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, and was evaluated at a 10 percent disability rating under 38 C.F.R. 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5260. In the same decision, the Veteran was also awarded service connection for left knee strain with patellar fracture (limitation of extension) (herein referred to as post-surgical left knee disability) and was evaluated at a 0 percent, or noncompensable, rating under 38 C.F.R. 4.71a, DC 5261. See March 2022 rating decision. 

On August 18, 2023, the Veteran underwent surgery to repair a left quadricep tendon tear affecting his left knee. In September 2023, he submitted VA Form 21-526EZ, requesting an increased rating for both of his service-connected left knee disabilities. In a December 2023 rating decision, currently on appeal, the AOJ recharacterized the Veteran's post-surgical left knee disability from DC 5261 to DC 5257 and granted a compensable disability rating of 20 percent for the recharacterized condition, effective September 27, 2023. The Veteran's service-connected left knee strain was continued at a disability evaluation of 10 percent under DC 5260. 

In the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ awarded a retroactive temporary total evaluation based on "surgical or other treatment necessitating convalescence," effective August 18, 2023 to November 1, 2023. The January 2024 rating decision also changed the effective date for the 20 percent rating for the Veteran's post-surgical left knee disability under DC 5257 to November 1, 2023. 

In the February VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket and listed his intent to appeal the amount of time for which he was assigned a total evaluation for convalescence, as well as the assigned ratings for his two service-connected left knee disabilities at that time.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 (10 percent evaluation of left knee strain) and January 2024 AOJ decisions (temporary total evaluation for convalescence from August 18, 2023 to November 1, 2023 and effective date of evaluation of 20 percent for post-surgical left knee disability from November 1, 2023) on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that, after submitting the February 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran submitted several claims for increased ratings of his service-connected post-surgical left knee disability and left knee strain. See April 2024 VA Form 526-EZ; June 2024 VA Form 20-0995; January 2025 VA Form 20-0995. These claims were addressed in AOJ rating decisions, issued during the pendency of this appeal, which resulted in favorable findings for the Veteran. These favorable findings have been accounted for in the Board's adjudication of the claims on appeal. 

Finally, the Board acknowledges that the most recent February 2025 AOJ rating decision evaluated the Veteran's post-surgical left knee disability under DC 5261 and his left knee strain under DC 5257. See February 2025 Rating Codesheet. However, as explained in more detail below, the Board finds that it is more appropriate to evaluate the claimed disabilities under the diagnostic codes in place at the time of the September 2023 increased rating claim (DC 5261) and those set forth in the December 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions on appeal (DCs 5257 and 5260). See generally Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2009). 

1. Entitlement to an extension beyond two months for temporary total evaluation due to post-surgical convalescence. 

The Veteran was in receipt of a temporary total evaluation based on surgical or other treatment necessitating convalescence for his service-connected post-surgical left knee disability from August 18, 2023 to October 31, 2023, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.30. The Veteran contends that the temporary total evaluation should have been extended beyond two months to a total of four months. See February 2024 VA Form 10182. 

A temporary total disability rating will be assigned without regard to other provisions of the Rating Schedule when it is established by report at hospital discharge or outpatient release that entitlement is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (a) for treatment of a service-connected disability, effective from the date of hospital admission or outpatient treatment and continuing for a period of one, two, or three months from the first day of the month following such hospital discharge or outpatient release. 38 C.F.R. § 4.30. Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (a), a temporary total rating will be assigned if the hospital or outpatient treatment of a service-connected disability resulted in: (1) surgery necessitating at least one month of convalescence; (2) surgery with respect to postoperative residuals such as incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps and recent amputations, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, or the necessity for house confinement, or the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches (regular weight-bearing prohibited); or (3) immobilization by cast, without surgery, of one major joint or more.

The termination of these total ratings will not be subject to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e). Such total rating will be followed by appropriate schedular evaluations. When the evidence is inadequate to assign a schedular evaluation, a physical examination will be scheduled and considered prior to the termination of a total rating under this section. 38 C.F.R. § 4.30.

Extensions of one, two, or three months beyond the initial three months may be made under the above paragraphs, and extensions of one to six months beyond the initial six months may be made under paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) with approval of the Adjudication Officer. 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (b). 

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has defined "convalescence" as the stage of recovery following an attack of disease, a surgical operation, or an injury; and recovery is defined as the act of regaining or returning toward a normal or healthy state. Felden v. West, 11 Vet. App. 427, 430 (1998). The Court has held that notations in the medical record as to the Veteran's incapacity to work after surgery must be considered in the evaluation of a claim brought under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.30. Id; Seals v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 291, 296-297 (1995). Further, the Court has noted that the term "convalescence" does not necessarily entail in-home recovery.

The medical evidence during the period on appeal shows that the Veteran's convalescence began on the date of the surgery to repair a left quadricep tendon tear, August 18, 2023. See September 2023 Surgical Report (associated with claims file as "Correspondence").

The Veteran's September 2023 post-operative evaluation reported that the Veteran "has been doing well." The Veteran reported that he was compliant with restrictions and no longer needed narcotic pain medication and had even stopped a prescribed aspirin regimen the previous week. He further denied stated he was attending physical therapy, and it was "going well." The provider noted that the Veteran's incision was healing, and that Veteran demonstrated passive range of motion (ROM) with flexion to 50 degrees, with only mild effusion noted. The provider informed the Veteran that he should restart the aspirin regimen, continue with physical therapy to eventually wean off crutches, bear full weight as tolerated with his crutches and brace, and schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks. See September 2023 "Progress Notes" by A.S., PA-C.

Pursuant to the Veteran's September 2023 claim, he was scheduled for a VA examination of his knees in October 2023. The examiner remarked that the Veteran had to constantly wear a brace and regularly used crutches at that time in his post-operative state. However, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran experienced no recurrent left knee subluxation or instability. There was no ankylosis noted. Some residual post-operative swelling, pain, and an abnormal range of motion due to the post-operative state of the knee, was recognized. Yet, no long-term repercussions or complications were reported. See October 2023 VA examination. 

Consequently, the January 2024 rating decision on appeal issued a retroactive temporary total evaluation from August 18, 2023 to November 1, 2023 in recognition of the Veteran's need for convalescence, his progressing recovery, and the lack of severe postoperative residual symptoms in his post-surgical medical records.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes he needed more time to convalesce than contemplated by the total temporary evaluation from August 18, 2023 to November 1, 2023. However, while lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, it is generally not competent to establish facts which require specialized medical knowledge or expertise. See Clemons, 23 Vet. App. at 4-5. Moreover, in considering the requirements of 38 C.F.R. 4.30 (a), though not exhaustive, it is clear that, the medical evidence of record during the period on appeal demonstrates that the Veteran did not experience incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps of recent amputations, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, and the necessity for house confinement after October 31, 2023. Although the October 2023 VA examination reported the Veteran's use of a brace and crutches, there is no medical evidence of record during the period on appeal to show that the Veteran required continued use of crutches or a wheelchair beyond the period of convalescence ending October 31, 2023.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the medical evidence of record does not show the Veteran experienced severe postoperative residuals as contemplated by 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (a) after October 31, 2023. Accordingly, the evidence does not support an extension of a total temporary evaluation beyond the initial three months awarded in the January 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (b). As the evidence of record during the period of appeal persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. §5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155 ; 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Examination reports are to be interpreted considering the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the appellant working or seeking work.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2.  

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria."). As such, the Veteran's reports of pain have been considered in conjunction with the Board's review of the limitation of motion diagnostic codes.

Disabilities of the knee are evaluated under multiple DCs, including DC 5256 (ankylosis), DC 5257 (other impairment, including recurrent subluxation or lateral instability), DC 5258 (dislocated semilunar cartilage), DC 5259 (symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage), DC 5260 (limitation of flexion), DC 5261 (limitation of extension), DC 5262 (impairment of the tibia and fibula), and DC 5263 (genu recurvatum). See 38 C.F.R. §4.71. Normal range of knee motion (ROM) is 140 degrees of flexion and zero degrees of extension. 38 C.F.R. §4.71, Plate II.

Separate ratings can be assigned for knee disabilities where symptomatology does not overlap, and the separate rating is based on additional disabling symptoms. This includes separate, concurrent ratings based on limitation of flexion (DC 5260), limitation of extension (DC 5261), lateral instability or recurrent subluxation (DC 5257), and meniscal conditions (DCs 5258, 5259). See Lyles v. Shinseki, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017).

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided; separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury only where the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; see also Esteban, 6 Vet. App. at 261-62.

Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability should be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Finally, the law allows for an effective date up to one year prior to the date of receipt of a claim, sometimes informally called "the one-year lookback period."  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).  Specifically, if an increase in disability level was "factually ascertainable" within one year prior to receipt of the increased rating claim, then the effective date will be the date on which that increase is shown to have occurred.

2. From July 17, 2023 to August 18, 2023, a disability rating of 30 percent for left knee strain with patellar fracture (limitation of extension).

3. From November 1, 2023 to January 17, 2024, a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for post-surgical left knee disability.

The Veteran seeks an increased disability rating for his post-surgical left knee disability throughout the entire period on appeal. See September 2023 VA Form 526-EZ; February 2024 VA Form 10182. Therefore, the period on appeal is from the September 27, 2023 claim for an increased rating (plus the one-year lookback period) to the January 19, 2024 notification letter for the January 2024 rating decision.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that a July 2024 AOJ rating decision, issued during the pendency of this appeal, increased the Veteran's disability rating for post-surgical left knee disability to 30 percent under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257, effective October 23, 2023.  However, the AOJ identified a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the July 2024 decision, and in a December 2024 rating decision, the AOJ corrected the effective date of the 30 percent award to November 1, 2023, the date on which the Veteran's temporary total disability rating due to convalescence terminated. As the increased rating is favorable to the Veteran, the Board will not disturb it. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

Thus, keeping in mind both the current 30 percent rating and the "one-year lookback period" for increased rating claims, the Board has divided its analysis based on the timing of the Veteran's left knee surgery: 1) from September 27, 2022 (one-year prior to the increased rating claim) to August 17, 2023 (the date prior to the Veteran's knee surgery), and 2) from November 1, 2023 to January 17, 2024 (the date of the rating decision on appeal).

A March 2022 rating decision awarded service connection for left knee strain with patellar fracture (limitation of extension) with a noncompensable, or 0 percent, evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261.

DC 5261 provides a noncompensable rating for limitation of extension to 5 degrees, a 10 percent rating for limitation of extension to 10 degrees, a 20 percent rating for limitation of extension to 15 degrees, a 30 percent rating for limitation of extension to 20 degrees, a 40 percent rating for limitation of extension to 30 degrees, and a 50 percent rating for limitation of extension to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261.

On July 17, 2023, the Veteran presented to the North Chicago VA Medical Center with a new left knee injury. He reported immediate swelling and inability to bear weight. The Veteran also reported difficulty flexing and extending his leg. The VA treatment provider noted that "his knee function is 20% normal." There was also a "marked decrease" in range of motion secondary to knee effusion, measured from 0 to 70 degrees with mild pain.  Additional VA treatment records note a diagnosis of "internal derangement of the knee" and a subsequent MRI showed, in part, a quadriceps tendon rupture led to a referral to a private provider for left knee surgery. See July 2023 VA treatment records; August 2023 private treatment record from D.Z., P.C.P. 

Private treatment records, from the time period after the Veteran's July 2023 left knee injury but prior to his August 2023 surgery, confirm that the Veteran experienced buckling, instability, and significant swelling to his left posterior knee due as a result of the injury. At that time, during passive range of motion testing, he measured an extension endpoint of 5 degrees. Consequently, the Veteran agreed to undergo "left open quadriceps tendon repair."  See August 2023 private treatment record from D.Z., P.C.P.

An October 2023 VA examination, conducted after the Veteran's August 2023 surgery and during his period of convalescence, recorded an extension endpoint of 0 degrees; however, it was noted that the Veteran was wearing "a locked knee brace set in full extension" at that time. See October 2023 VA examination. 

There is no additional medical evidence addressing the Veteran's left knee limitation of extension throughout the period on appeal. As such, the Board finds that the probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's left knee limitation of extension, under DC 5261, worsened on July 17, 2023 and manifested in extension limited to no worse than 20 degrees until his surgery.  

A higher evaluation of 40 or 50 percent under DC 5261 is not warranted as there is no medical evidence of record prior to August 17, 2023 showing that the Veteran's limitation of extension was limited beyond 20 degrees. Therefore, the Board finds that a rating of 30 percent, from July 18, 2023 to August 17, 2023 sufficiently considers the factually ascertainable worsening of the Veteran's service-connected left knee strain with patellar fracture (limitation of extension) under DC 5261 during the "one year lookback period" prior to the September 2023 increased rating claim.

Moving forward, a December 2023 rating decision, issued after the Veteran's August 2023 left knee surgery and pursuant to the September 2023 increased rating claim, recharacterized the Veteran's disability and evaluated his post-surgical left knee disability with a 20 percent rating under DC 5257, effective September 27, 2023. The January 2024 rating decision on appeal changed the effective date of the Veteran's 20 percent rating to November 1, 2023; moving forward from the temporary total evaluation he received during his period of convalescence. As mentioned above, July 2024 and December 2024 rating decisions established a 30 percent rating, effective November 1, 2023.

DC 5257, with respect to recurrent subluxation or instability, sets forth a 10 percent rating for a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. A 20 percent rating is warranted for either a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device for ambulation; or unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, where a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device or bracing for ambulation. A 30 percent rating is warranted for unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device and bracing for ambulation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257.

DC 5257 also evaluates patellar instability. A 10 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker. A 20 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: a brace, cane, or walker. A 30 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker. Id.

Again, post-operative treatment records indicate the Veteran's left knee was healing as expected and no abnormal findings were noted. See September 2023 "Progress Notes" by A.S., PA-C.

In addition, the Board observes that the October 2023 VA examiner noted no recurrent left knee subluxation, instability, or ankylosis. Some residual post-operative swelling, pain, and an abnormal range of motion due to the post-operative state of the knee was reported. Furthermore, the examiner remarked that, due to his post-operative condition, the Veteran had to constantly wear a brace and regularly used crutches at that time; however, he noted that the "complete [ligament] tear repair" was "successful." Furthermore, the Veteran did not report that he was taking any medication at the time of the examination. As such, the examiner made no mention of any ameliorative effects of medication and its use need not be discounted by the Board. See Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, Vet. App. (Mar. 12, 2025).

Thus, the Board finds that a rating of 30 percent, from November 1, 2023 to January 17, 2024  sufficiently considers the frequency, severity, and duration of symptoms arising from the Veteran's post-surgical left knee disability under DC 5257. 

Lastly, the Board notes that a 30 percent rating is the maximum disability rating allowed under DC 5257. The Veteran does not contend, nor does the evidence suggest, that he is entitled to a rating under DC 5256 (ankylosis or its functional equivalent), DCs 5258 and 5259 (meniscus), DC 5262 (tibia and fibula impairment), or DC 5263 (genu recurvatum). 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the probative evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of a 30 percent disability rating, but no higher, for the Veteran's left knee condition under DC 5261 from July 18, 2023 to August 17, 2023, as well as a rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's post-surgical left knee disability from November 1, 2023 to January 17, 2024 under DC 5267. 

4. From September 27, 2022 to December 20, 2023, a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee strain. 

The March 2022 rating decision awarding service connection for left knee strain evaluated the disability at 10 percent, effective October 20, 2020. The 10 percent evaluation was granted based on painful motion of the knee pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 and awarded under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260.

DC 5260 provides a noncompensable (0 percent) rating for limitation of flexion to 60 degrees, a 10 percent rating for limitation of flexion to 45 degrees, a 20 percent rating for limitation of flexion to 30 degrees, and a 30 percent rating for limitation of flexion to 15 degrees.

A January 2022 VA examination measured the Veteran's left knee flexion endpoint at 120 degrees. See January 2022 VA examination (associated with claims file in February 2022). 

Immediately after the Veteran's left knee injury in July 2023, his range of motion was  measured from 0 (extension) to 70 (flexion) degrees. See July 2023 VA treatment records. In August 2023, prior to the Veteran's surgery, his flexion was also measured with an endpoint of 70 degrees. See August 2023 private treatment record from D.Z., P.C.P.

The Veteran's post-operative treatment record notes that the Veteran's left knee flexion was limited to 90 degrees. See September 2023 "Progress Notes" by A.S., PA-C.

The October 2023 VA examiner determined both the active and passive endpoints of the Veteran's left knee flexion to be 80 degrees, with exhibited pain in weight-bearing tests, causing functional loss. The examiner again noted that the testing was taking place while the Veteran wore a post-operative locked knee brace and used crutches for weightbearing. The examiner also estimated that the Veteran's knee would be limited to an endpoint of 80 degrees for flexion after repeated use due to his post-operative state. No muscle atrophy or ankylosis of the left knee was noted; moreover, no recurrent subluxation or persistent instability of the left knee was noted. The examiner reported the successful surgical repair of the torn left ligament but noted that there had been no surgical repair of the left knee for patellar instability. See October 2023 VA examination.

Consequently, the December 2023 rating decision on appeal for this issue continued the 10 percent disability evaluation first assigned in the March 2022 rating decision awarding service connection. See December 2023 rating decision. 

In reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence of record during the period on appeal does not warrant a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's left knee strain. Specifically, the Board finds that there is no evidence from which a rating in excess of 10 percent is factually ascertainable in the one year prior to the September 2023 increased rating claim. In addition, the Board finds it highly probative that, despite the post-surgical condition of the Veteran during the October 2023 VA examination, his left knee flexion endpoint still did not manifest at a degree warranting an increase to 20 percent during the period on appeal. Moreover, the Veteran did not report that he was taking any medications at the time of the October 2023 examination; thus, there is clear evidence that the ameliorative effects of medication were not considered by the VA examiner and any benefit thereof need not be discounted. See Ingram at No. 23-1798, Vet. App.

Therefore, based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's left knee strain under DC 5260, throughout the period on appeal. As such, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply and the claim for an increased rating for service-connected left knee strain is denied. 38 U.S.C. §5107(b), Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.
