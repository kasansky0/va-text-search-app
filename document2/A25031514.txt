DOCKET NO. 221208-303378
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to an increased disability rating for lumbar strain is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On October 3, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 1994 to June 1998.  This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2021 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the December 8, 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  However, as the Veteran withdrew her claim, no hearing was held.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  See October 2024 Statement in Support of Claim.  Accordingly, the claim for an increased rating for lumbar strain is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.
