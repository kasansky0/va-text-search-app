REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had service in the National Guard with active duty for training from August 2012 to March 2013.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board or BVA) on appeal from rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

On October 28, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request:  Supplemental Claim, for service connection for bilateral knee condition and bilateral foot condition; the Veteran also filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, for a higher rating for right ankle and service connection for mental health condition, tinnitus, right shoulder condition, back condition, and bilateral hip condition.  By rating decision dated in February 2022, service connection was denied for right knee condition, left knee condition, and bilateral foot condition.  By rating decision dated in July 2022, a higher rating was denied for lateral collateral ligament sprain; service connection was also denied for mental health condition, tinnitus, right shoulder condition, back condition, and bilateral hip condition.   

On January 4, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 with respect to a higher rating for lateral collateral ligament sprain and service connection for a mental health condition, tinnitus, right shoulder condition, back condition, bilateral hip condition, bilateral knee condition, and bilateral foot condition.  By rating decision dated January 9, 2023, service connection was denied for mental health condition and tinnitus.  By rating decision dated February 13, 2023, service connection was granted from January 4, 2023, for right knee strain with meniscal tear (10 percent rating), left knee strain with meniscal tear (10 percent rating), shin splints (zero percent rating), bilateral plantar fasciitis (10 percent rating), right hammer toe and left hammer toe (zero percent rating); service connection was granted from January 4, 2023, for right shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis, labral tear, tendinitis and subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis (20 percent rating).  In addition, the AOJ denied an increased rating for the Veteran's lateral collateral ligament sprain as well as service connection for a back condition and a bilateral hip condition.

On May 5, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 526-EZ for service connection for bilateral hand condition.  On May 18, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the January 2023 and February 2023 decisions.  On May 28, 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a HLR decision which granted service connection from October 29, 2021, for right shoulder recurrent dislocation (20 percent rating).  The AOJ also granted an earlier effective date of October 28, 2020, for the grants of service connection for right knee strain with meniscal tear, left knee strain with meniscal tear, shin splints, bilateral plantar fasciitis, and right hammer toe and left hammer toe; an earlier effective date of October 28, 2021, was also granted for the grant of service connection for right shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis, labral tear, tendinitis and subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis.  In addition, higher initial ratings were denied for right knee strain with meniscal tear, left knee strain with meniscal tear, shin splints, bilateral plantar fasciitis, right hammer toe and left hammer toe, and right shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis, labral tear, tendinitis and subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis.  Further, the AOJ also denied an increased rating for the Veteran's lateral collateral ligament sprain as well as service connection for a mental health condition, tinnitus, and a bilateral hip disability.  By rating decision dated July 15, 2023, service connection was granted from September 30, 2021, for degenerative arthritis to include DDD other than IVDS (20 percent rating); by rating decision dated July 11, 2023, service connection was denied for left hand condition and residuals of status post right boxer fracture of the fifth finger.

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), with respect to denial of service connection for mental health condition, tinnitus, left hand condition, residuals of status post right boxer fracture of the fifth finger, and bilateral hip condition; denial of higher rating for right ankle; effective dates assigned for right shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis, labral tear, tendinitis and subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis and right shoulder recurrent dislocation; and effective dates and ratings assigned for degenerative arthritis to include DDD other than IVDS, right knee strain with meniscal tear, left knee strain with meniscal tear, shin splints, bilateral plantar fasciitis, and right and left hammer toes.  The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 9, 2023, decision for mental health condition and tinnitus; at the time of the February 13, 2023, decision (which was subsequently subject to higher-level review) for right knee strain with meniscal tear, left knee strain with meniscal tear, shin splints, bilateral plantar fasciitis, right hammer toe, left hammer toe, right shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis, labral tear, tendinitis and subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis, lateral collateral ligament sprain, and bilateral hip condition; at the time of the July 11, 2023 decision for left hand condition and residuals of status post right boxer fracture of the fifth finger; and at the time of the July 15, 2023, decision for degenerative arthritis to include DDD other than IVDS.

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decisions noted above, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran contends that he has tinnitus as a result of military noise exposure.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

Tinnitus, ringing in the ears, is capable of lay observation, and as such a Veteran can ascertain that he has the disability of tinnitus.  Thus, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran has tinnitus.  The question, therefore, remains as to whether a nexus exists between the Veteran's tinnitus and his active-duty service.

The service treatment records are absent complaints, findings, and diagnoses of tinnitus during service.  

The Veteran underwent VA examination in December 2021 at which time the examiner opined that tinnitus was less likely than not a result of military noise exposure.  The examiner stated, 

He reports that tinnitus started 4.5 to 5 years ago, 3+ years after his separation on 3-31-13.  Implications for Hearing Loss and Tinnitus (2005) study allows that there is a possibility of a delay in onset of tinnitus due to noise exposure.  It states that "as the interval between a noise exposure and the onset of tinnitus lengthens, the possibility that tinnitus will be triggered by other factors increases.  A more complete understanding of the mechanisms by which tinnitus is generated will be needed before the existence of delayed onset of noise-induced tinnitus can be confirmed or rejected."  In the absence of objectively verifiable noise injury, the association between claimed tinnitus and noise exposure cannot be assumed to exist.  However, you would have to accept the scientifically unsubstantiated theory that tinnitus occurred as a result of some latent, undiagnosed noise injury.  IOM never stated that tinnitus could result from undiagnosed noise injuries. In most cases, tinnitus is accompanied by measurable hearing loss.  It is recognized that the audiogram is an imperfect measurement. Nevertheless, it is accepted as the objective basis for determining noise injuries.  Tinnitus due to noise exposure or acoustic trauma is known to have a noticeable onset immediately or soon following the incident; however, the patient reported onset of tinnitus 3+ years after leaving military service.  The claimant served on active duty for only 7 months.  Due to no reported specific acoustic trauma resulting in the onset of tinnitus during active military service, normal hearing thresholds upon separation from military service which continues today, his reports that tinnitus started 3+ years after his separation on 3-31-13 and no complaints of tinnitus in the veteran's medical records, the veteran's tinnitus is less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure.

The Board finds that the medical/audiological evidence of record does not support the Veteran's claim for service connection.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to testify as to the onset and symptoms of his tinnitus.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  Specifically, a Veteran is capable of observing tinnitus symptoms and the date of onset of such symptoms.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002).  Although the Veteran is competent to observe tinnitus and to assert that it has been continuous since service, that is not what is being claimed here.  The Veteran is not competent to ascertain that tinnitus which was first observed subsequent to service is related to such service as this is a medical question requiring training and credentials.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board, therefore, concludes that, although the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's tinnitus began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether service connection is warranted for tinnitus.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left hand disability

3. Entitlement to service connection for residuals status post right boxer fracture of the fifth finger

The Veteran essentially contends that he has a left hand disability and residuals status post right boxer fracture of the fifth finger as a result of his active-duty service.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current left hand or right fifth finger diagnosis that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The service treatment records are absent complaints, findings, and diagnoses of a hand or finger problem during service.  Post service treatment records are absent complaints, findings, and diagnoses of a left hand problem. 

The Veteran underwent VA examination in May 2023 at which time he was diagnosed as having residuals status post right boxer fracture of the fifth finger; no diagnosis was rendered with respect to the Veteran's left hand.  The examiner noted that there was no pathology to warrant a left hand diagnosis.  

Thus, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis related to his left hand and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  To the extent that the Veteran believes that there is a current left hand diagnosis, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical knowledge.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has residuals status post right boxer fracture of the fifth finger.  The question, therefore, remains as to whether a nexus exists between the Veteran's residuals status post right boxer fracture of the fifth finger and his active-duty service.

The examiner opined that the Veteran's residuals status post right boxer fracture of the fifth finger were less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner noted that post military private/VA treatment records indicate that in January 2023, the Veteran presented with right hand pain.  The Veteran reported that he was lifting a cement block, lost his balance, and heard a pop in his shoulder.  He stated that the block he was holding fell onto his right hand.  The examiner opined, 

After reviewing medical records and performing a physical exam, it is less likely than not that the veteran's Residuals S/P Right Boxer Fracture (5th finger) was incurred in or due to military service as there are no medical records showing diagnosis, treatment for the right hand fracture during active duty, nor are there any medical records to demonstrate a continuity of care after service.  Therefore per lack of evidence during or after military service, a nexus cannot be made to support today's diagnosis and connect it with military service at this time. 

The Board finds that the medical evidence of record does not support the Veteran's claim for service connection.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to testify as to the onset of hand/finger symptoms.  Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469.  Although the Veteran is competent to observe hand and finger symptoms and to assert that it has been continuous since service; however, that is not what is being claimed here.  The Veteran specifically reported that the condition began in 2023.  The Veteran is not competent to ascertain that residuals status post right boxer fracture of the fifth finger which was first observed subsequent to service is related to such service as this is a medical question requiring training and credentials.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377.

The Board, therefore, concludes that, although the Veteran has a current diagnosis of residuals status post right boxer fracture of the fifth finger, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that such began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether service connection is warranted for a left hand disability and residuals status post right boxer fracture of the fifth finger.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claims.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hip disability

The Veteran contends that he has a hip disability as a result of his active-duty service.  On December 28, 2021, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of claim, in which he provided specific details as to why he believed that his hips problems were directly related to his military service, specifically in Airborne School.  The Veteran stated that during his fifth parachute jump in training, the comrade above him had his parachute collapse on top of the Veteran's causing them to become entangled in the air.  The Veteran fell over 1200 feet, and although he managed to free himself, he suffered an extremely impactful landing and felt a huge "THUD" once he hit the ground.  The Veteran stated that he remembered severe pain in his hips after this landing which became worse over time.  The Veteran stated that after completion of Airborne training, he was put into selection and completed even more rigorous training - 16-mile runs and having to carry fellow comrades' body weight up and down hills - made the pain in his hips even worse.  The Veteran stated that continued to experience these issues throughout his military service and continue to experience severe pain and limited range of motion since he was discharged.  

The service treatment records are absent complaints, findings, and diagnoses of hip problem.  Post-service treatment records indicate that in February 2021, the Veteran complained of right hip pain radiating down to the ankle. 

The Veteran underwent VA examination in December 2021 at which time the examiner noted that there was no current right or left hip pathology to render a diagnosis, that the Veteran denied having hip problems or symptoms, and that physical examination and x-rays were normal.

Thus, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis related to his bilateral hip disability claim and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  To the extent that the Veteran believes that there is a current bilateral hip disability diagnosis, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical knowledge.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377.

The Board has considered Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), in which the Federal Circuit held that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."  Id. at 1367-69.  In this case, however, the December 2021 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran did not have a hip disability that impacted his ability to perform any type of occupational task. 

As stated, to the extent that the Veteran believes there is a current hip diagnosis, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical knowledge.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377.  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

Thus, the Board finds that the medical evidence of record does not support the Veteran's claim for service connection.  

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether service connection is warranted for a bilateral hip disability. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claims.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

Earlier Effective Dates

VA laws and regulations provide that unless otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of increased evaluation shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The effective date for a grant of service connection is the day following the date of separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from active service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats.  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.151, 3.155).  The amendments apply to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b), when a claim is filed within one year of the VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File Claim for Compensation, VA will consider the fully developed claim as filed as of the date of the intent to file the claim.  When a veteran provides an Intent to File, it must then be "followed by" a complete claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b)(6). However, "[o]nly one complete claim for a benefit may be associated with each intent to file a claim for that benefit. In the event multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within 1 year of an intent to file a claim for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim." 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(1)(iii).

The effective date of an award of service connection is assigned not based on the date the disability appeared or the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating the existence of such disability and a causal connection to service or a service-connected disability; rather, the effective date is assigned based on consideration of the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was received by VA.  See LaLonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382-383 (1999).

5. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 28, 2020, for the grant of service connection for right knee strain with meniscal tears

6. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 28, 2020, for the grant of service connection for left knee strain with meniscal tears

8. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 28, 2020, for the grant of service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis

9. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 28, 2020, for the grant of service connection for right hammer toes

10. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 28, 2020, for the grant of service connection for left hammer toes

Historically, the record indicates that the Veteran filed a VA 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC, on January 28, 2018.  On February 6, 2019, VA received the VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, indicating current disabilities of a bilateral knee condition and a bilateral feet condition.  By rating decisions in July 2019 and again in October 2019, service connection for, inter alia, both knees and feet conditions were denied.  The Veteran did not appeal these decisions; and no new and material evidence was received within one year of the October 4, 2019, notification letter. 

The record indicates that the Veteran filed a VA 21-0966 on October 28, 2020; he filed another on September 30, 2021, and another on October 28, 2021.  On October 28, 2021, at 10:26 a.m., VA received VA Form 21-526EZ for service connection for, inter alia, right shoulder condition.  At 10:27 a.m., VA received VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request:  Supplemental Claim, for service connection for a bilateral knee condition and a bilateral foot condition.  A few days later, in November 2021, VA informed the Veteran that his supplemental claim was incomplete, that he needed to submit new and relevant evidence, and that if VA received within 60 days from the date the incomplete application was received, VA would consider his claim as filed as of the date of receipt of the completed application.   

In the December 28, 2021, statement, the Veteran provided specific details as to why he believed that his knees and feet were related to his military service.  By rating decision dated February 7, 2022, the Veteran's previously denied claims for service connection for conditions of the right knee, left knee, and bilateral feet were reconsidered but denied on their merits.  

On January 4, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 with respect to service connection for his knees and feet.  By rating decision dated February 13, 2023, service connection was granted for right knee strain with meniscal tear, left knee strain with meniscal tear, shin splints, bilateral plantar fasciitis, right hammer toe and left hammer toe.  In addition, service connection was granted for right shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis, labral tear, tendinitis and subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis.

With regard to the date of claim, as noted above, the Veteran did not appeal the October 2019 decision; and no new and material evidence was received within one year of the October 4, 2019, notification letter.  A finally adjudicated claim is an application which has been allowed or disallowed by the AOJ, the action having become final by the expiration of one year after the date of notice of an award or disallowance, or by denial on appellate review, whichever is the earlier.  See 38 U.S.C. §7105 (c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103.  Thus, the October 2019 decision is final.  

A review of the file reveals no communication from the Veteran or his representative indicating an intent to file a claim for service connection for a knee disability or a foot disability at any time after the October 2019 decision until October 28, 2020.  Neither the Veteran nor his attorney have contended otherwise. Therefore, the Board finds that October 28, 2020, is the proper date of claim.

Importantly, the pertinent regulations specifically state that the effective date should be the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  In the instant case, based on these regulations, the effective date has been appropriately assigned as the date of claim for service connection.  While sympathetic to the Veteran's belief that an earlier effective date is warranted, for the reasons outlined above, the Board is precluded by statute from assigning an effective date prior to October 28, 2020, for the grants of service connection for right knee strain, left knee strain, shin splints, bilateral plantar fasciitis, right hammertoe, and left hammer toe.     

11. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 28, 2021, for the grant of service connection for right shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis, labral tear, tendinitis and subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis

12. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 28, 2021, for the grant of service connection for right shoulder recurrent dislocation

13. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 30, 2021, for the grant of service connection for degenerative arthritis to include DDD other than IVDS 

As noted above, the Veteran filed a VA 21-0966 on October 28, 2020; he filed another on September 30, 2021, and another on October 28, 2021.  On October 28, 2021, at 10:26 a.m., VA received VA Form 21-526EZ for service connection for, inter alia, right shoulder condition and back condition.  At 10:27 a.m., VA received VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request:  Supplemental Claim, for service connection for a bilateral knee condition and a bilateral foot condition.  

By rating decision dated February 13, 2023, service connection was granted for right shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis, labral tear, tendinitis and subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis effective from January 4, 2023.  By rating decision dated May 28, 2023, service connection was granted for right shoulder recurrent dislocation effective from October 28, 2021; an effective date of October 28, 2021, was also assigned for the Veteran's right shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis, labral tear, tendinitis and subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis.  By rating decision dated July 15, 2023, service connection was granted for degenerative arthritis to include DDD other than IVDS effective September 30, 2021.

With regard to the date of claim, as noted above, the Veteran filed a VA 21-0966 on October 28, 2020; he filed another on September 30, 2021, and another on October 28, 2021.  On October 28, 2021, at 10:26 a.m., VA received VA Form 21-526EZ for service connection for, inter alia, back condition and right shoulder condition.  At 10:27 a.m., VA received VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request:  Supplemental Claim, for service connection for a bilateral knee condition and a bilateral foot condition.   

When a veteran provides an Intent to File, it must then be "followed by" a complete claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b)(6).  However, "[o]nly one complete claim for a benefit may be associated with each intent to file a claim for that benefit.  In the event multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within 1 year of an intent to file a claim for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(1)(iii).  

In this case, the "first" claim filed after the October 28, 2020, was the claim for service connection for back condition and right shoulder condition; it was filed one minute prior to his claim for service connection for bilateral knee condition and bilateral foot condition.

A review of the file reveals no communication from the Veteran or his representative indicating an intent to file a claim for service connection for a lumbar spine disability or a right shoulder disability at any time prior to October 28, 2020.  Neither the Veteran nor his attorney have contended otherwise. 

Therefore, the Board finds that October 28, 2020, is the proper date of claim.

As noted above, the pertinent regulations specifically state that the effective date should be the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  In the instant case, based on these regulations, the effective date is the date of claim for service connection.  Thus, the Board is precluded by statute from assigning an effective date prior to October 28, 2020, for the grants of service connection for right shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis, labral tear, tendinitis and subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis, right shoulder recurrent dislocation, and degenerative arthritis to include DDD other than IVDS.

14. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 6, 2019, for the grant of service connection and the assignment of a 10 percent rating for right lateral collateral ligament strain

The Board notes that in his VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed the rating and effective date assigned for the Veteran's right ankle disability.  

Service connection for right ankle sprain was granted by rating decision dated in July 2019; a 10 percent rating was assigned effective from February 6, 2019.  A higher rating was denied in an October 3, 2019, rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal these decisions; and no new and material evidence was received within one year of the October 4, 2019, notification letter.  On October 28, 2020, VA received the Veteran's Intent to File; and on October 28, 2021, VA received the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for right ankle sprain.  By rating decision in July 2022, a higher rating was denied for lateral collateral ligament sprain (formerly right ankle sprain).  In January 2023, VA received the Veteran's 20-0995 which included a higher rating for right ankle sprain.  By rating decision dated in February 2023, a higher rating for the Veteran's lateral collateral ligament sprain was denied.  In May 2023, VA received the Veteran's 20-0996 which included a higher rating and earlier effective date for right ankle condition.  By rating decision dated in May 2023, an earlier effective date for the 10 percent rating for the Veteran's right lateral collateral ligament strain was denied.

The effective date of a grant of service connection of a disability must be timely filed after the rating decision that grants the benefit.  It may not later be claimed as a stand-alone claim after the statutory time limit to appeal has passed.  A claim for an earlier effective date is a downstream element of a grant of service connection and the adjudication of a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date violates the rule of finality.  See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299 (2006) (holding that stand-alone claims for earlier effective dates have no legal merit).  

Therefore, as the rating decision issued in October 2019 was not appealed, an appeal of the effective date of service connection or the initial 10 percent rating for right lateral collateral ligament strain at this current juncture would constitute a stand-alone claim, which violates the rule of finality.  As such, the Board finds that there is no issue in controversy with regard to an effective date prior to February 6, 2019, for the grant of service connection for right lateral collateral ligament strain and the assignment of a 10 percent rating.  The claim is, therefore, dismissed as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

As the Veteran is requesting a higher rating for his right lateral collateral ligament sprain, an already established service-connected disability, the present disability level is the primary concern and past medical reports do not take precedence over current findings.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  However, "staged" ratings are appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The Veteran is also appealing the original assignments of disability ratings following awards of service connection for degenerative arthritis to include DDD other than IVDS, right and left knee strain with meniscal tears, shin splints, plantar fasciitis, and right and left hammer toes.  For these claims, it is not the present level of disability which is of primary importance, but rather the entire period is to be considered to ensure that consideration is given to the possibility of staged ratings; that is, separate ratings for separate periods of time based on the facts found.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

The intent of the Rating Schedule is to recognize actually painful, unstable or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint, even in the absence of arthritis, to include in situations where the disability at issue is not evaluated based on range of motion measurements.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59; Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011); Southall-Norman v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 346 (2016).

When a law or regulation changes during the pendency of an appeal, the version most favorable to the Veteran applies, absent congressional intent to the contrary. See VAOPGCPREC 3-2000, 65 Fed. Reg. 33,422 (May 23, 2000); Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  The amended rating criteria, if favorable to the claim, can be applied only for periods from the effective date of the regulatory change; however, the old regulations will be considered for the periods both before and after the change was made.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114; VAOPGCPREC 3-2000, 65 Fed. Reg. 33,422 (May 23, 2000); Kuzma, 341 F.3d 1327.

15. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right lateral collateral ligament sprain

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his service-connected right ankle disability.  

The Veteran's right lateral collateral ligament sprain has been rated 10 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271, for limitation of motion of the ankle.  Under Diagnostic Code 5271, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle and a 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle.  Id.  

Normal ranges of motion of ankles are dorsiflexion from 0 degrees to 20 degrees and plantar flexion from 0 degrees to 45 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for Diagnostic Code 5271.  85 Fed. Reg. 76,453 (Nov. 30, 2020).  Under the new criteria, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle (less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion.)  A 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion.)  As this regulatory change was enacted during the pendency of this appeal, the Board will consider both the old and new versions of the rating criteria from the effective date and apply the version most favorable to the Veteran.  

According to MERRIAM WEBSTER, "moderate" means "tending toward the mean or average amount or dimension".  See www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moderate. "Marked" means "having a distinctive or emphasized character".  See www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marked.

The Veteran underwent VA examination in November 2021 at which time he denied flare-ups but reported wearing an ankle brace when attempting physical activities.  Physical examination demonstrated plantar flexion to 40 degrees and full dorsiflexion with no evidence of pain and no objective evidence of crepitus.  There was no additional loss of function or range of motion on repetitive use testing and the examiner determined that the evidence did not suggest pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination significantly limited function ability with repeated use over time.  There was no muscle atrophy, ankylosis, or instability. 

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for right lateral collateral ligament sprain.  

There is no evidence that the Veteran's right ankle symptoms more nearly approximate marked limited motion.  Dorsiflexion was normal; and plantar flexion measured 40 degrees.  Thus, these measurements did not meet the criteria corresponding to a higher 20 percent rating.  

The Board has considered whether any other Diagnostic Codes related to disabilities of the ankle would provide for a higher disability rating.  However, the evidence does not reflect that the symptoms would warrant a higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's appeal for a rating in excess of 10 percent for right lateral collateral ligament sprain.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

16. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for degenerative arthritis to include DDD other than IVDS

The Veteran is seeking a higher initial rating for his service-connected lumbar spine disability.

The Veteran's degenerative arthritis to include DDD other than IVDS has been rated as 20 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242.  Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Id.  at Note 1.  

Ankylosis is defined as "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure."  Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 94 (32nd ed. 2012).  Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.  Id.  at Note 5.  

The Veteran underwent VA examination in December 2021 at which time he reported difficulty bending down, going up and down stairs, squatting, and lifting from the ground; he denied flare-ups.  Physical examination demonstrated flexion to 80 degrees with pain, extension to 25 degrees with pain, and normal lateral flexion and lateral rotation.  Passive range of motion findings were the same as active range of motion.  There was no additional loss of function or range of motion on repetitive use testing.  The examiner estimated that pain significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over time such that flexion would be limited to 60 degrees and extension would be limited to 15 degrees.  There was also no crepitus, guarding, muscle spasm, ankylosis, radiculopathy, or objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue.  Muscle strength testing, reflex exam, and sensory exam were all normal.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have IVDS.  

The Veteran underwent VA examination in July 2023 at which time he reported at which time he reported flare-ups and difficulty with prolonged walking or climbing stairs.  Physical examination demonstrated flexion to 60 degrees; extension, lateral flexion, and lateral rotation all to 20 degrees; and pain with all motion.  There was additional loss of range of motion on repetitive use testing due to pain and lack of endurance such that flexion was to 55 degrees; extension, lateral flexion, and lateral rotation all to 15 degrees.  The examiner estimated that pain and lack of endurance significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over time such that flexion would be limited to 50 degrees and extension, lateral flexion, and lateral rotation would be limited to 10 degrees.  The examiner estimated that pain and lack of endurance significantly limited functional ability with flare-up such that flexion would be limited to 45 degrees and extension, lateral flexion, and lateral rotation would be limited to 10 degrees.  There was also no crepitus, guarding, muscle spasm, ankylosis, radiculopathy, or objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue.  Muscle strength testing, reflex exam, and sensory exam were all normal.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have IVDS.  

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent for degenerative arthritis to include DDD other than IVDS.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was estimated additional functional loss due to pain and lack of endurance during repetitive use over time and flare-ups.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  As noted above, the examiner estimated that at its worse, flexion would be limited to 45 degrees and extension, lateral flexion, and lateral rotation would be limited to 10 degrees.

Consideration has been given to assigning a rating under the Formula for IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  However, the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran has IVDS.  As noted above, the VA examiners indicated that the Veteran did not have IVDS.  Regarding neurological impairment, the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran has any other neurological abnormality associated with the spine disability.  As noted above, the VA examiners indicated that the Veteran did not have radiculopathy; in addition, the examiner also found that the Veteran did not have any other neurologic abnormalities or findings related to his spine disability.

Based on the foregoing, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 20 percent for degenerative arthritis to include DDD other than IVDS.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

17. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee strain with meniscal tear

18. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee strain with meniscal tear

The Veteran seeks a higher rating for his service-connected knee disabilities.

The Veteran's right and left knee strain with meniscal tears have been rated at 10 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260, for limitation of flexion of the leg.  Under Diagnostic Code 5260, a noncompensable rating is warranted for flexion limited to 60 degrees.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 15 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.

In this case, the Veteran has been assigned a 10 percent rating for each knee for functional loss due to painful motion pursuant to 38C.F.R. §4.59, which allows for a compensable rating available for limitation of motion for a joint if there is acknowledged painful motion.

The Veteran underwent VA examination in February 2023 at which time he reported flareups and daily severe pain with prolonged standing, sitting, walking, carrying weight, bending at the knee, and squatting.  Physical examination demonstrated right knee motion from zero to 105 degrees with pain and left knee motion from zero to 110 degrees with pain.  The examiner estimated that pain significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over time such that right knee flexion would be limited to 100 degrees and left knee flexion would be limited to 105 degrees.  The examiner estimated that pain significantly limited functional ability with flare-up such that right knee flexion would be limited to 100 degrees and left knee flexion would be limited to 105 degrees.  There was objective evidence of crepitus and localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue.  There was no muscle atrophy or ankylosis.  The examiner noted that there were meniscal tears of both knees with frequent episodes of joint locking, pain, and effusion but no meniscal dislocation.    

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for right and left knee strain with meniscal tears.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain during flare-ups and pain during repetitive use over time.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating flexion limited to 30 degrees.  As noted above, the examiner estimated that at its worse, flexion would be limited to 100 degrees on the right and 105 degrees on the left.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the knee and leg.  Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment). 

However, a higher rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5256 as there is no evidence of knee ankylosis; a higher rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5258 as although there was evidence of meniscal tear with locking, pain, and effusion into the joint, there was no evidence of dislocated semilunar cartilage; a higher or separate rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5259 as there is no evidence of removal of semilunar cartilage; a separate rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5261 as there is no evidence of extension limited to 10 degrees; and a separate rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5263 as there is no diagnosis of genu recurvatum.

The Board notes that a separate noncompensable rating has been established for the Veteran's shin splints; thus, a discussion regarding Diagnostic Code 5262 is below.  In addition, the Board has remanded the issues of entitlement to separate ratings for right and left knee recurrent subluxation or persistent instability; as such a discussion regarding Diagnostic Code 5257 at this time would be premature.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for right and left knee strain with meniscal tears.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

19. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for shin splints

The Veteran seeks a higher rating for his service-connected shin splints.

The Veteran's shin splints have been rated as noncompensable pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5262, for impairment of the tibia and fibula. 

Under Diagnostic Code 5262, a 10 percent rating is warranted for malunion of tibia and fibula with slight knee or ankle disability.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for malunion of the tibia and fibula with moderate knee or ankle disability.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for malunion of the tibia and fibula with marked knee or ankle disability.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for nonunion of the tibia and fibula with loose motion requiring a brace.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5262.

According to MERRIAM WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 999 (11th Ed. 2007), "slight" means small in amount.  "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect.  "Marked" means having a distinctive or emphasized character.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for disabilities of the knee and leg.  The amended Diagnostic Code 5262 continues to provide a rating for impairment of the tibia and fibula.  The rating criteria are split into three categories:  medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), or shin splints; malunion; and nonunion.

For MTSS, or shin splints, a noncompensable rating is warranted for treatment less than 12 consecutive months, one or both lower extremities.  A 10 percent rating is warranted where treatment is required for no less than 12 months, and unresponsive to either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, one or both lower extremities.  A 20 percent rating is warranted where treatment is required for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, one lower extremity.  A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted where treatment is required for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, both lower extremities.

For malunion of the tibia and fibula, evaluate under diagnostic codes 5256, 5257, 5260, or 5261 for the knee, or 5270 or 5271 for the ankle, whichever results in the highest evaluation.

A 40 percent rating is warranted for nonunion of the tibia and fibula, with loose motion, requiring brace.

With respect to the rating criteria prior to February 7, 2021, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for shin splints.  There is no evidence of nonunion or malunion of the tibia and fibula.  With respect to the amended rating criteria, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for shin splints.  The examiner noted treatment less than 12 consecutive months for one or both lower extremities.  

As noted above, the Board has considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the knee and leg.  However, a higher rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5256 as there is no evidence of knee ankylosis; a higher rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5258 as although there was evidence of meniscal tear with locking, pain, and effusion into the joint, there was no evidence of dislocated semilunar cartilage; a higher or separate rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5259 as there is no evidence of removal of semilunar cartilage; a separate rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5261 as there is no evidence of extension limited to 10 degrees; and a separate rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5263 as there is no diagnosis of genu recurvatum.

The Board has also remanded the issues of entitlement to separate ratings for right and left knee recurrent subluxation or persistent instability; as such a discussion regarding Diagnostic Code 5257 at this time would be premature.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for shin splints. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

20. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral plantar fasciitis

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his service-connected bilateral plantar fasciitis.

The Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis has been rated as 10 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5269, for plantar fasciitis.  Under Diagnostic Code 5269, a 10 percent rating is warranted for plantar fasciitis, otherwise, unilateral or bilateral.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for unilateral plantar fasciitis with no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment.  A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for bilateral plantar fasciitis with no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment.

However, prior to February 7, 2021, there was no specific diagnostic code for plantar fasciitis.  Thus, plantar fasciitis was rated by analogy to Diagnostic Code 5284, which contemplates other foot injuries under the old rating criteria.  Under Diagnostic Code 5284, a 10 percent rating is warranted when a foot injury is productive of a moderate disability.  A 20 percent rating is warranted when a foot injury is productive of a moderately severe disability, and a 30 percent rating is warranted when a foot injury is productive of a severe disability.  A maximum rating of 40 percent may be assigned if loss of use of a foot is demonstrated.

Words such as "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decision is "equitable and just."  38 C.F.R. § 4.6 (2018).  With this principle in mind, the term "moderate" is generally defined as "of average or medium quality, amount, scope, range, etc." and the term "severe" is generally defined as "extremely intense." See Webster's New World Dictionary, Third College Edition, 871, 1071 (1988).

The Veteran underwent VA examination in January 2023 at which time he reported bilateral foot pain on walking; specifically, he stated, "It's usually throbbing and can be pretty sharp."  He also reported wearing shoe inserts.  The Veteran reported daily flare-ups of severe foot pain which lasted between 30 minutes to a full day caused by prolonged standing and walking and which caused difficulty with prolonged standing and walking.  The Veteran reported having undergone non-surgical treatment of both feet for plantar fasciitis which did not relieve his symptoms.  The Veteran denied undergoing surgical treatment or having such surgical intervention recommended.  

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral plantar fasciitis.  The Veteran reported using orthotic inserts but no other assistive devices.  He is also able to stand and walk but has difficulty after prolonged standing and walking.  The Board finds that these findings are tantamount to a moderate foot disability.  Therefore, a higher rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5284.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71.

A higher rating is also not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5269 as the Veteran has not demonstrated plantar fasciitis with no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment.  

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the foot.  Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); see also Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017).  

In this case, there is no evidence that the Veteran has foot symptoms more analogous to acquired flatfoot, weak foot, acquired claw foot (pes cavus), metatarsalgia, hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, malunion or nonunion of tarsal or metatarsal bones such that Diagnostic Codes 5276, 5277, 5278, 5279, 5280, and 5281 are not applicable. 

Finally, the Federal Circuit concluded that the Board must also consider assigning separate ratings under analogous Diagnostic Codes, when rating an unlisted service-connected foot disability exhibiting distinct manifestations, even when service connection has also been granted for one of the eight conditions listed in the rating schedule.  Id.  

The Board notes that a separate noncompensable rating has been established for the Veteran's right and left hammer toes; thus, a discussion regarding Diagnostic Code 5282 is noted below.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral plantar fasciitis.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

21. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right hammer toe

22. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left hammer toe

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his service-connected hammer toes.

The Veteran's right and left hammer toes have been rated as noncompensable under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5282, for hammer toe.  Under Diagnostic Code 5282, a noncompensable rating is warranted for hammer toes of single toes.  A maximum 10 percent rating is warranted for hammer toe of all toes, unilateral, without claw foot.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5282.  

As noted above, the Veteran underwent VA examination in January 2023 at which time physical examination demonstrated hammer toes of the great toes on both feet.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for the Veteran's hammer toe disability.  

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the foot.  Here, the Veteran's disability is specifically listed under the rating schedule and therefore cannot be rated under a different Diagnostic Code.  The Board notes that a separate noncompensable rating has been established for the Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis; thus, a discussion regarding Diagnostic Code 5269 is noted above.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for right and left hammer toes.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

23. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he has PTSD related to his active military service.  At an August 2021 Mental Health Initial Evaluation, the Veteran reported that his PTSD onset was in April 2012 after combat military training and being at the National Guard.  The Veteran reported experiencing multiple stressful experiences during his military training including being exposed to constant battle drills, being injured with a bullet, and witnessing someone being shot in training.   Veteran reports anxious mood, combat-related nightmares, vivid dreams, flashbacks, repeated disturbing memories, avoiding memories related to the stressful experience, poor frustration tolerance, angry outbursts, being "super alert", poor sleep and feeling jumpy.  

At an October 15, 2020, VA Mental Health consultation, the Veteran identified relevant outstanding private treatment records.  He noted that he underwent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) counseling in 2013/2014 in Kenniwick, Washington.  A remand is required to allow VA to obtain authorization and request these records.

24. Entitlement to a separate rating for right knee recurrent subluxation or persistent instability

25. Entitlement to a separate rating for left knee recurrent subluxation or persistent instability

Under Diagnostic Code 5257, a 10 percent rating is warranted for slight recurrent subluxation or lateral instability.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for severe recurrent subluxation or lateral instability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for disabilities of the knee and leg.  The amended Diagnostic Code 5257 provides ratings for other impairment of the knee based on recurrent subluxation or instability, and patellar instability.

For recurrent subluxation or instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted for sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for one of the following: (a) Sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation; or (b) Unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.  A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation.

For patellar instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: A brace, cane, or walker.  A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker.

As noted above, the Veteran underwent VA examination in July 2023 at which time the examiner noted that there was recurrent subluxation or persistent instability of both knees and that the Veteran had been prescribed knee braces for ambulation.  The examiner found no recurrent patellar instability.  As such, the Board can only assume that the Veteran suffers from persistent instability; however, there is no description of such instability to allow the Board to determine whether such is lateral instability and if so, if it is slight, moderate, or severe under the criteria of Diagnostic Code 5257 prior to February 7, 2021.

A remand is required to allow the Veteran to undergo an additional VA examination which identifies the instability and measures its severity.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for PTSD counseling records in Kenniwick, Washington.  Make two requests for the authorized records unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

2. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of the service-connected right and left knee disabilities.    The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria, to specifically include the type of instability and its severity in millimeters.
