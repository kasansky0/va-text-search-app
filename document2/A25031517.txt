REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for urinary frequency is remanded. 

Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disorder is remanded. 

Entitlement to service connection for a left ankle disorder is remanded. 

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service in the United States Marine Corps from August 1990 to August 1994. 

This appeal comes to the Board of Veteran's Appeals (the Board) following a November 2023 rating decision denying service connection for urinary frequency, and right and left ankle disorders, and hypertension. Later in November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the November 2023 rating decision. 

In April 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior November 2023 decision.  The Veteran appealed the HLR decision by filing a 

VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in April 2024. He elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, consideration may only be given to the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR in April 2024. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the November 2023 decision, which was then subject to HLR in April 2024, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for urinary frequency, right and left ankle disorders, and hypertension, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to Service Connection for Urinary Frequency

2. Entitlement to Service Connection for a Right Ankle Disorder

3. Entitlement to Service Connection for a Left Ankle Disorder

4. Entitlement to Service Connection for Hypertension

One of the effects of the AMA is to narrow the set of circumstances in which the Board must remand appeals to the AOJ for further development instead of immediately deciding them directly. However, the Board has the duty to remand issues when necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error where the issues cannot be granted in full. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) has the duty to assist claimants in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiating a claim for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A. Pursuant to the duty to assist, VA must make reasonable efforts to obtain relevant private treatment records adequately identified by the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b)(1). In VA treatment records from January 2023, the Veteran indicated that he was receiving treatment from both VA providers and his private primary care physician, "Dr. Sam" in Homerville, Georgia. Review of the record shows that VA attempted to obtain private treatment records from Dr. S.C. in November 2010. However, VA did not attempt to obtain records from Dr. S.C. in conjunction with the claims currently on appeal. As such, upon remand, VA should request authorization to obtain these records, as they are potentially relevant to his claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A.  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, additional development is required for the claim for service connection for hypertension. 

On August 10, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act). Under the PACT Act, VA is required to provide a disability examination and obtain a medical opinion when a veteran submits a claim for compensation and has (1) evidence of a disability and (2) participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), but the evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability. 

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1710(e)(1), a toxic exposed veteran includes veterans presumed to have been exposed to burn pits and other toxins (BPOT) under 38 U.S.C. § 1119(c)(1). The Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to BPOT, as he had service in Southwest Asia from August 1990 to July 1991. The November 2023 and April 2024 rating decisions also favorably found that the Veteran participated in a TERA. This favorable finding is binding on the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. 

A TERA examination regarding the claim for entitlement to service connection for hypertension was obtained in November 2023. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's hypertension is less likely than not caused by the claimed TERAs, after considering the total potential toxic exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs. In reaching this opinion, the examiner did not consider the Veteran's Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER). Rather, in her review of the evidence, she stated that she was unable to locate the ILER file. The Veteran's ILER was added to his claims file in September 2023. It is unclear why the examiner was unable to locate the ILER. 

The November 2023 VA examiner's failure to review the ILER renders the TERA opinion inadequate. Her statement that she was unable to locate the ILER calls into question the adequacy of her review of the Veteran's claims file. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008); see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007). Furthermore, without reviewing the Veteran's ILER, it is unclear as to whether her opinion truly considered the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs in addressing the question of whether the Veteran's hypertension is related to his claimed TERAs.

When VA provides an examination, it must ensure that the examination is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). Because the November 2023 TERA examination is inadequate, it was a pre-decisional duty to assist error for the AOJ to rely on this examination in denying the Veteran's claim for service connection for hypertension. Remand is therefore required to obtain a new VA medical opinion with respect to participation in a TERA, considering both the Veteran's conceded exposure to BPOTs in Southwest Asia and the synergistic, combined effects of all TERAs. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142a for Dr. S.C. and any other private physician from whom he received treatment regarding his urinary frequency, right and left ankle disorders, and hypertension. Document all requests for information, as well as all responses, in the claims file. Make two requests for the authorized records from these physicians unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile. 

2. Schedule the Veteran for a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) examination regarding his hypertension in compliance with the PACT Act, considering (1) his presumed exposure to BPOTs in Southwest Asia and (2) the synergistic, combined effects of all TERAs. 

The examiner must fully explain the rationale for all opinions, with citation to supporting data/lay statements, as deemed appropriate. If the examiner cannot provide the requested opinions without resorting to speculation, he or she should expressly indicate this and provide a supporting rationale as to why an opinion cannot be made without resorting to speculation.
