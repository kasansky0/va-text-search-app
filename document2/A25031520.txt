ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of October 5, 2023, for the award of service connection for migraines, including migraine variants, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's Supplemental Claim of service connection for migraine headaches was received by VA on October 26, 2023, following receipt of an intent to file on October 5, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of October 5, 2023, for the award of service connection for migraines, including migraine variants, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.151, 3.155, 3.400, 3.2501.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from July 2011 to January 2013.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied an effective earlier than February 13, 2024, for the award of service connection for migraines, including migraine variants.  

In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on which she identified the June 2024 rating decision, the issue as entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for migraines, including migraine variants, and elected the Direct Review docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the period to request a change in docket has not yet elapsed.  In cases placed on the Direct Review docket, claimants generally have 60 days from the date of receipt by the Board of the VA Form 10182; or, 1 year from the date notice was sent regarding the AOJ decision being appealed, whichever is later, to request a change in docket.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  In this case, the date of the end of the period in which the Veteran could request a change in docket would be June 24, 2025.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  Given the fully favorable decision below, the Board finds no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding prior to the expiration of the docket change period.    

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 13, 2024, for the award of service connection for migraines, including migraine variants.   

The Veteran contends that an effective date of October 5, 2023, is warranted for the award of service connection for her service-connected migraine disability.  She asserts that her October 2023 claim of service connection for a psychiatric disability included a claim of service connection for migraine headaches, secondary to her service-connected psychiatric disability.  She contends that she sought confirmation from VA in November 2023 that the issues of service connection for migraine headaches had been included as part of her claim and that they would be added to the claim received in October 2023.  See also September 2024 Appellant's Brief.   

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim or a supplemental claim "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The implementing regulation clarifies this to mean that the effective date of service connection and compensation based on an initial claim or a supplemental claim will be the "date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later."  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A "claim" means a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).   

An initial claim is a new claim requesting service connection for a disability or grant of a new benefit on a form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p)(1), 3.160(b).  A supplemental claim is any complete claim for a VA benefit on an application form prescribed by the Secretary where an initial or supplemental claim for the same or similar benefit on the same or similar basis was previously decided.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p)(2), 3.2501.

A complete claim is required for all types of claims, and will generally be considered filed as of the date it was received by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d).  For Supplemental claims, upon receipt of a communication indicating a belief in entitlement to benefits that is submitted in writing or electronically on a supplemental claim form prescribed by the Secretary that is not complete as defined in § 3.160(a) of this section, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete claim within 60 days of notice by VA that an incomplete claim was filed, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the incomplete claim.  Id.  

A claimant may indicate a desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in paragraph (a) of § 3.160 [defining the elements of a complete claim], appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  

Turning to the evidence of record, in an April 2020 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for migraines.  Although the Veteran was duly notified of the decision and her available review options in a letter dated April 17, 2020, she did not exercise any of those options within one year.  She does not contend otherwise.  

On October 5, 2023, VA received an intent to file from the Veteran.  That same day, the RO acknowledged receipt of the intent to file and provided instructions on completing the claim.  

On October 26, 2023, VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, on which the Veteran noted that the disabilities she was seeking service connection for were on an attached form.  Attached to that application for benefits, and included with the document in the electronic claims folder is a separate form which lists the issues of "acne" and "persistent depressive symptoms."  In addition, the Veteran also submitted additional documents with her application for benefits, including a VA Form 21-10210 Lay/Witness Statement.  This form clarified that the application for benefits related to her psychiatric disability included additional symptoms such as insomnia, tremors, and migraine headaches.  The Veteran indicated these were all proximately due to or part of her service-connected psychiatric disability.  Additionally, she discussed her acne while on active service and her current symptoms of acne.  

Further, the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion, dated October 21, 2023, which opined, in pertinent part, that the Veteran's migraine headaches were associated with her service-connected psychiatric disorder.  

In November 2023, just over a month after her claim was received, the Veteran called the VA to confirm that the issues of entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches, insomnia, and tremors, on a secondary basis, were being considered as part of her claim for an increased rating for her psychiatric disability.  A memorialization of what was discussed in the call was prepared on November 28, 2023.  It was specifically noted that the additional issues were included with the claim form received the day her VA Form 21-526EZ was received.  It was noted that these conditions were not added to the pending claim and the Veteran requested that they be considered as part of the pending claim.  

In January 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision which denied entitlement to service connection for tremors, denied an increased rating for service-connected acne, and granted an increased 70 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability, which now included symptoms of chronic sleep impairment, claimed as insomnia in the October 2023 application for benefits.  Notice of this decision was mailed to the Veteran on January 17, 2024.  

On January 16, 2024, VA mailed the Veteran a letter indicating that she must file the claim for migraines on the appropriate form, as that claim had been previously denied.  

On January 18, 2024, VA received from the Veteran a VA Form 21-10210, Lay/Witness Statement indicating that she was going to be filing a Supplemental Claim for service connection for migraine headaches.  She submitted her VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim on February 13, 2024. 

In a May 2024 decision, the RO granted service connection for migraines, including migraine variants, and assigned an initial 30 percent rating effective February 13, 2024, the date of receipt of the Supplemental Claim form.  

Considering the evidence of record in light of the applicable legal criteria, the Board finds that an effective date of October 5, 2023, is warranted for the award of service connection for migraines, including migraine variants.  

As set forth above, the October 2023 application for benefits noted that the disabilities being sought were delineated in an attached document.  Included with the application was a document which claimed service connection for migraine headaches.  

Because the Veteran's claim of service connection for migraine headaches had been previously denied in an April 2020 rating decision, in a January 2024 letter, the RO advised the Veteran that she was required to submit the claim on the proper form, i.e. a Supplemental Claim form.  On February 13, 2024, within 60 days of the RO's letter, the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim was received.  Because the Veteran's complete Supplemental Claim was received within 60 days of notice by VA that her claim of service connection for migraines had been submitted on the incorrect form, it is considered to be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the incomplete claim.  

Regardless, the Board notes that the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has recently held that although a Supplemental Claim needs to be filed on a form prescribed by the Secretary, it does not need to be filed on a specific supplemental claim form; rather while VA regulations provide requirements for filing a supplemental claim on "a form prescribed by the Secretary," they do not specify a particular form.  Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (March 13, 2025).  

Thus, the Board finds multiple legal basis for determining that the Veteran's Supplemental Claim of service connection for migraines was received by VA on October 26, 2023, following receipt of an intent to file on October 5, 2023.  As a result, the Board concludes that the criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of October 5, 2023, is warranted for the award of service connection for migraines, including migraine variants.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400.
