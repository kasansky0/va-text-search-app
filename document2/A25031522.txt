REFERRED

Per an April 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Veteran sought review of the above-listed issues adjudicated in the March 2023 rating decision. To date, the RO has neither adjudicated nor otherwise acknowledged this filing. Therefore, the pending April 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review is referred to the RO for appropriate action.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time the Veteran sought Board review of above-listed issues, he had already requested higher-level review of such via his April 2023 VA Form 20-0996, which is still pending final adjudication by the Regional Office.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the above issues have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1991 to December 1992 and December 1996 to June 2017.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2023, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), wherein the Veteran attempted to appeal a March 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). He elected the Direct review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Following issuance of the March 2023 rating decision as to the above-titled issues, the Veteran filed an April 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Higher-Level Review Request as to such. Three months later, and prior to the RO's adjudication of the higher-level review request, the Veteran separately filed the above-referenced July 2023 VA Form 10182 to appeal these issues to the Board.

With the submission timeline of the Veteran's April 2023 VA Form 20-0996 and July 2023 VA Form 10182, and in light of the fact that the higher-level review request as to as to all issues was still pending at the time the July 2023 VA Form 10182 was received and has not yet been adjudicated, the Board finds that the July 2023 VA Form 10182 involved concurrent election, which is prohibited under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). Significantly, a claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under § 3.2500(a) (i.e., request for higher-level review, appeal to the Board, or supplemental claim), may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different option. Here, the Veteran filed for a Board appeal as to these issues while his prior request for higher-level review as to the same issues, stemming from the same rating decision, was pending adjudication, as the RO had still not acknowledged the April 2023 VA Form 20-0996.

As concurrent elections are prohibited under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b), the above-titled issues were improperly docketed. Because the valid and timely filed April 2023 VA Form 20-0996 was pending before the RO at the time of submission of the July 2023 VA Form 10182, the issues appealed in the VA Form 10182 are dismissed as a matter of law.

If, after the RO considers his April 2023 VA Form 20-0996, the Veteran continues to disagree with any of the issues adjudicated in the responsive rating decision, then he can initiate further review by filing either VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim or VA Form 10182 within one year after issuance of such. If the Veteran chooses to file VA Form 20-0995 after issuance of the Higher-Level Review rating decision adjudicating these issues, he is encouraged to file such with medical evidence documenting current diagnoses and/or treatment for his claimed disabilities, since, in the March 2023 rating decision, most of his service connection claims were denied for lack of evidence of a current disability. 

As discussed above, his April 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review as to the above-titled issues adjudicated in the March 2023 rating decision is referred to the RO for appropriate action.
