ORDER

New and relevant evidence having been received, the readjudication of the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include persistent depressive disorder with major depressive episode, is warranted.

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include persistent depressive disorder with major depressive episode, is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Evidence added to the record, including medical records and the Veteran's statements, constitute new and relevant evidence warranting readjudication.

2. The competent and probative evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as persistent depressive disorder with major depressive episode, is causally related to his military service.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for readjudication of the claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501.

2. The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, as currently diagnosed, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1154(a), 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1986 to September 1991. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in March 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the July 25, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran referenced the March 2024 decision and elected the Board's Direct Review docket. Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of March 18, 2024-the date of the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after March 18, 2024, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

By way of background, the Veteran, in May 2021, originally filed a service connection for depression, which was recharacterized by the RO as a claim for PTSD with persistent depressive disorder with major depressive episode and denied. See 5/26/2021 VA Form 21-526EZ; see 8/14/2021 Rating Decision. In light of the diagnoses and symptoms of record, the Board has recharacterized the issues as a single claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 4-6 (2009) (holding that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and other information of record).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. In order to establish entitlement to service connection, there must generally be 1) evidence of a current disability; 2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and 3) causal connection between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by their senses. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a). VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed Cir. 2009).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is applicable and VA shall make all reasonable inferences in the Veteran's favor. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. New and relevant evidence pertaining to the Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include persistent depressive disorder with major depressive episode.

In a May 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran claimed service connection for depression. 5/26/2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, p. 13. In relation to that claim, the Veteran underwent a July 2021 VA examination for PTSD. See 7/2/2021 C&P Exam. The RO then denied service connection for PTSD with persistent depressive disorder with persistent major depressive episode due to missing an in-service stressor and a nexus. 8/14/2021 Rating Decision. The August 2021 rating decision became final after one year. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a). 

The Veteran filed a supplemental claim for service connection on November 3, 2023, citing the previous denial of PTSD with persistent depressive disorder with persistent major depressive episode. 11/3/2023 VA Form 20-0995, p. 1. In the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, the RO found that new and relevant evidence had not been submitted in relation to the supplemental claim and that, therefore, readjudication was not warranted. 3/18/2024 Rating Decision, p. 4.

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d). "New" evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. "Relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).

The Board finds that since the last final rating decision in August 2021 that denied service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, VA treatment records reveal continued reports of depression and a desire to attend therapy. 11/15/2023 CAPRI, p. 4. In addition, the Veteran submitted a November 2023 private medical opinion, which concluded that Veteran's mental health symptoms warrant a compensable rating under the relevant diagnostic codes, implicitly finding that the Veteran should be service-connected for a mental health disorder. 11/3/2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Gov't Facility. 

The Board finds that the updated VA records showing current complaints of and treatment for depression and the private medical opinion detailing the Veteran's symptoms, having not previously been of record at the time of the prior final rating decision, may prove or disprove the nexus element of the claim of service connection. Accordingly, the Board finds such evidence to be both new and relevant and that readjudication of the claim is warranted.

2. Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include persistent depressive disorder with major depressive episode.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, including persistent depressive disorder with major depressive episode. See 11/3/2023 VA Form 21-0995. Because the competent and probative evidence of record is in approximate balance, service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is warranted. While the March 2024 decision did not reach the merits as it did not find that new and relevant evidence has been submitted, the Board finds there is no prejudice here as the Board's action results in a grant of service connection benefit sought. 

The Veteran underwent a July 2021 VA examination, at which he was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder with persistent major depressive episode. Based on this competent medical evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran has a current diagnosis and that the first element of service connection has been established. 

As to the second element of service connection, that of an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, the Veteran provided a detailed account of two in-service incidents that resulted in the onset of his mental health disorder while in service. See 12/18/2023 C&P Exam. The Veteran reported that while stationed in Germany, he witnessed the death of a friend who was struck by a drunk driver. Id. at 6. The Veteran recounted that he was called to the scene and that he held his friend's hand as she passed away. Id. In addition, the Veteran provided an account that multiple soldiers in his unit were killed, including the soldier who was to be his specific replacement. Id. The Veteran reported that he had begun experiencing nightmares, anxiety, and depressed mood while in service and that he continues to experience these symptoms to today. 7/2/2021 C&P Exam, p. 6. The Veteran further reported that he did not seek treatment for his psychiatric issues while in service because he felt as though they were a normal part of his position. Id.

A veteran is competent to report symptoms that he experiences at any time because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007). Although the Veteran lacks the medical expertise to establish a link between the symptoms of his acquired psychiatric disorder and his military service, he is nonetheless competent to report his history of symptoms. The Board finds that in making all reasonable inferences in the Veteran's favor, the facts of record establish the second element of service connection. The event described by the Veteran, such as responding to an accident, are consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service, to include his MOS of law enforcement specialist. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). 

The third and final element of service connection is that of a medical nexus between the Veteran's medical condition and his military service. 

The Veteran underwent a July 2021 VA examination, after which the examiner concluded that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's persistent depressive disorder with persistent major depressive episode was incurred in or caused by the Veteran's military service. 7/2/2021 C&P Exam, p. 2. The examiner provided as rationale that the Veteran's in-service experiences, including witnessing the death of a friend and dealing with the knowledge of the death of the soldiers who replaced him, led to depressed mood, passive suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbance, among other symptoms, and that he had suffered from those symptoms since the time he experienced the events in service. Id. The Board finds that the July 2021 examiner's report is based on a physical examination of the Veteran and a thorough review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs), post-service treatment records, and military personnel record. The Board finds the July 2021 examiner to be competent and credible and that the examination report has substantial probative weight. 

The Veteran submitted a private medical opinion from a family nurse practitioner in November 2023. See 11/3/2023 Med. Treatment Rec. The opinion provides a detailed statement from the Veteran regarding his current symptomatology and the medical provider concludes that the Veteran's symptoms warrant a compensable rating under Title 38. Id. The opinion does not expressly state that the Veteran's symptoms are medically and causally linked to his military service. To the extent that the opinion is implicitly concluding that a medical nexus exists because in order to be awarded a compensable rating the Veteran would already have established the elements of service connection, the Board acknowledges the competency and credibility of the medical provider and assigns the opinion minimal probative weight. 

After review of the competent and probative evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is, at a minimum, in approximate balance and that the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Therefore, in resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include persistent depressive disorder with major depressive episode, is warranted. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is remanded.

After filing his November 2023 supplemental claim for service connection, the RO scheduled the Veteran for an initial PTSD examination. 11/15/2023 Exam Request, p. 5. The Veteran underwent the examination on December 18, 2023. See 12/18/2023. The December 2023 examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and identified two in-service stressors that contributed to the Veteran's diagnosis. Id. at 1, 8. 

The December 2023 examination report, however, does not provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's PTSD was at least as likely as not due to or the result of his active military service. The Board finds that not obtaining a medical nexus opinion from the December 2023 examiner after having confirmed the Veteran's PTSD diagnosis and in-service stressors was a pre-decisional duty to assist error that required a remand for correction. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.802(a), 3.159(c)(4), 3.304(f).

This matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

Obtain a medical opinion from the December 2023 VA examiner, if available, addressing whether the Veteran's PTSD is etiologically related to his in-service stressors identified during his December 2023 VA examination or other stressors that may have occurred during his military service. If the December 2023 VA examiner is unavailable, schedule the Veteran for a new examination with an appropriate clinician and obtain a medical opinion addressing the etiology of any diagnosed mental health conditions. 

A complete rationale for all opinions must be provided. If the clinician cannot provide a requested opinion without resorting to speculation, it must be so stated, and the clinician must provide the reasons why an opinion would require speculation. The clinician must indicate whether there was any further need for information or testing necessary to make a determination. Additionally, the clinician must indicate whether any opinion could not be rendered due to limitations of knowledge in the medical community at large and not those of the particular clinician.
