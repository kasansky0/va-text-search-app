DOCKET NO. 250320-519761
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), due to service-connected disabilities is granted.

INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from November 1969 to March 1970.

In January 2025, the Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision which addressed the above-noted issue.  Thereafter, in February 2025, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), wherein he sought to appeal the claim in the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) System.  He selected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the RO issued the January 2025 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Generally, the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an AMA docket switch has elapsed.  In particular, 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows claimants to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new Notice of Disagreement (NOD) within one year from the date the RO mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives the NOD, whichever is later; unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in?38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302?and 20.303, or the appellant or their representative has requested a?waiver?of the right to request to switch dockets during this timeframe. See?Williams?v. McDonough,?37?Vet. App.?305?(2024).  

Because the Board is granting the Veteran's TDIU claim in full, and the Veteran has requested his case be advanced on the docket, the expeditious treatment of this appeal is harmless. 

FINDING OF FACT

During the period of this appeal, the Veteran has met the threshold percentage requirements and has been unable to maintain any form of substantially gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational background as a result of his service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.19. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

Duties to Notify and Assist

As explained below, the Board has determined that the evidence currently of record is sufficient to substantiate the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a TDIU.  Therefore, no further development is required under 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A or 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 before the Board decides the claim.

Burden of Proof

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under the laws administered by VA.  VA shall consider all information and medical and lay evidence of record.  Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  

Legal Criteria

It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  A finding of total disability is appropriate, "when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation."  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340 (a)(1), 4.15.

"Substantially gainful employment" is that employment, "which is ordinarily followed by the nondisabled to earn their livelihood with earnings common to the particular occupation in the community where the veteran resides." Moore (Robert) v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991).  Marginal employment is not considered substantially gainful employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration may be given to a veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his age or to any impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

TDIU may be assigned when the schedular rating for service-connected disabilities is less than 100 percent when it is found that the service-connected disabilities are sufficient to produce unemployability without regard to advancing age, provided that, if there is only one such disability, it is ratable at 60 percent or more, or, if there are two or more disabilities, there is at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and additional disabilities to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran submitted a claim for entitlement to a TDIU rating in November 2021.  Following an initial denial of his claim in January 2023, the Veteran sought higher-level review.  In a May 2023 rating decision, the higher-level reviewer found duty to assist deficiencies in the development of the Veteran's TDIU claim, and as such, returned the case for readjudication.  

Thereafter, the RO issued the above-noted January 2025 rating decision, which determined the Veteran's claim for TDIU was moot as he satisfied the requirements for a 100 percent combined disability rating.  However, the Veteran's combined 100 percent rating was granted from January 2023.  Since the Veteran has continuously pursued his TDIU claim since November 2021, the Board will address whether a TDIU rating was warranted prior to the assignment of a 100 percent combined rating in this case.  

As a threshold matter, the Board notes service connection has been established for coronary artery disease (CAD) and prostate cancer, both evaluated as 60 percent disabling, as well as tinnitus, rated 10 percent.  Those service connected disability ratings have been in effect since the Veteran initiated his TDIU claim in November 2021.  The combined rating at that time was 90 percent.  As such, the Veteran satisfied the scheduler criteria for a TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a) from the date he initiated his TDIU claim.  

After consideration of the record and resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds the service-connected CAD and prostate cancer disabilities have been sufficiently disabling as to render the Veteran unable to maintain substantially gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational background.  The Veteran worked as pharmacist until June 2011.  This job, and virtually any other job, required the Veteran to be able to attend a normal 8-hour workday.  

In the course of this appeal, the Veteran has undergone VA examinations, which indicate he experiences CAD manifestations, including chest pain and breathlessness, with minimal exertion such as walking and light yard work.  The Veteran also must wear absorbent pads as a result of his urinary incontinence following his prostatectomy procedure.  His former employer noted his very frequent use of the bathroom due to his urgency issues, as well as his need to sit often.  

In sum, affording the Veteran the benefit of all reasonable doubt, the Board is satisfied the evidence establishes his service-connected CAD and prostate cancer residuals/urinary incontinence were sufficiently severe to render him unable to maintain any form of substantially gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational background.  This follows, because the evidence indicates the Veteran would experience significant impairment with both physical and sedentary employment and would be virtually unable to attend to any occupation requiring him to engage in an 8 hour workday without an extraordinary need for breaks.  Additionally, the Board notes a high combined disability rating itself is recognition that service-connected disabilities are productive of functional impairment for employment.  Here, as noted above, the Veteran's combined disability rating was 90 percent at the time he initiated his TDIU claim.  Accordingly, a TDIU is warranted.
