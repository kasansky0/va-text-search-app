ORDER

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as secondary to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's OSA developed secondary to, or was aggravated by, service-connected PTSD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for OSA as secondary to PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1989 to March 1992. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.  

A June 2014 rating decision originally denied the Veteran's April 2014 claim for service connection for OSA. The Veteran submitted an April 2016 claim, but a July 2016 rating decision denied the claim, finding that the Veteran did not submit new and material evidence. The Veteran submitted an October 2022 supplemental claim, but a March 2023 rating decision denied the claim, finding that the Veteran did not submit new and relevant evidence. The Veteran submitted an April 2023 supplemental claim, and a July 2023 rating decision found that the Veteran submitted new and relevant evidence but denied the claim upon readjudication. In response to the Veteran's September 2023 request for Higher-Level Review (HLR), a January 2024 rating decision returned the claim to the AOJ to correct a duty to assist error, but the July 2024 rating decision on appeal continued the denial of service connection for OSA. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Generally, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is caused or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires competent and credible evidence demonstrating: (1) a current disability; (2) a service-connected disability; and (3) the current disability was either (a) caused or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Service connection for OSA as secondary to PTSD. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for OSA, asserting his OSA developed as a result of service-connected PTSD. See April 2014 VA Form 21-4138; July 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ; October 2022 VA Form 20-055; April 2023 VA Form 20-0995; September 2023 VA Form 20-0996. 

The AOJ found the Veteran has a current disability, as the evidence shows he is diagnosed with OSA, and the Veteran's PTSD is a service-connected disability. See July 2024 Rating Decision; January 2024 Rating Decision; March 2023 Rating Decision. These findings are binding on the Board. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). 

The question on appeal is whether the Veteran's OSA was caused or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected PTSD. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc).

The Veteran contends his OSA developed secondary to PTSD, because his PTSD causes sleep deprivation. See July 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. The Veteran reported he was diagnosed with OSA in 2012. See January 2024 VA HLR Informal Conference. The Veteran reported that his psychiatrist indicated OSA developed secondary to PTSD. Id. The Veteran indicated that he snored during service but was discouraged from going to sick call because he was told that everyone snores. Id. However, the Veteran reported that his fellow service members did not want to sleep near him because the Veteran's snoring was so severe. Id. Veterans are competent to provide evidence of that which they experience, including symptoms and medical history. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Lay people are competent to describe visible or otherwise observable symptoms of disability. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The Veteran is competent to report that he was diagnosed with OSA and that his psychiatrist stated OSA developed as a result of PTSD. If lay evidence is competent, the Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007). The Veteran's competent statements are consistent with other evidence. The Veteran's competent lay statements are therefore credible and constitute highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the claim.

Service treatment records (STRs) do not reflect complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to OSA. See STRs received April 1992. Therefore, STRs do not weigh in favor of or against service connection for OSA. 

VA treatment records show that the Veteran was first referred to VA's sleep clinic in November 2012 because the Veteran reported sleep issues during a psychosocial assessment for mood disorder. See CAPRI received October 2022. The Veteran described problems sleeping, including difficulty falling or staying asleep, recurrent nightmares, sleep disturbances, restlessness, difficulty concentrating while awake, loud snoring, unrefreshing sleep, restless sleep, early morning awakenings, witnessed apnea, and choking or gasping for breath while asleep. Id. A July 2013 sleep study diagnosed the Veteran with OSA, but it appears the Veteran did not connect with the sleep clinic again until the Veteran's primary care doctor sent another referral to the sleep clinic in September 2013. Id. After connecting with VA's sleep clinic, the Veteran was provided a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine to treat OSA, and his OSA has been well-controlled with the use of the CPAP ever since. Id.; see also CAPRI received February 2024. Thus, VA treatment records support the Veteran's competent, credible lay statements and show that there is a connection between the Veteran's psychiatric illness and OSA, as the Veteran's original referral to the sleep clinic was prompted by a psychosocial assessment. Accordingly, VA treatment records constitute highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the Veteran's claim. 

A February 2023 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with OSA. See February 2023 VA Examination. The Veteran reported that his OSA onset around 1990, but he did not undergo a sleep study until 2014. Id. The examiner found the Veteran's OSA is less likely than not related to service, opining that the evidence does not support a nexus between the current diagnosis and service, and without evidence of chronicity during or after service, a post-service illness, event, or injury is a more likely etiology. Id. The examiner did not opine as to whether the Veteran's OSA developed secondary to PTSD. Id. Therefore, the opinion did not address the Veteran's competent, credible lay statements. See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249 (2020); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Consequently, the February 2023 VA examination and opinion is accorded minimal probative weight. 

An April 2023 letter from J.B., a psychiatric nurse practitioner at VA, opined that the Veteran's PTSD stressors contributed to the development of OSA. See April 2023 VA Form 20-0995. In support of the opinion that the Veteran's OSA developed secondary to, or was aggravated by his PTSD, the rationale explained there is reason to believe that a relationship between the two diagnoses exists and that OSA developed as a result of PTSD. Id. The opinion considered the indications of the Veteran's lay statements and the findings of VA treatment records, and the rationale addressed both causation and aggravation. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-304 (2008); see also El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 138 (2013). The opinion is consistent with the other probative evidence. Therefore, the April 2023 letter is adequate and constitutes highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the claim.

A July 2023 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with OSA and found the Veteran's OSA is less likely than not proximately due to, or the result of, service-connected PTSD. See July 2023 VA Examination. The examiner indicated there was insufficient medical evidence to establish a baseline level of severity for OSA. Id. Despite the inability to establish a baseline level of severity, the examiner opined the Veteran's OSA was not aggravated by service-connected PTSD. Id. The examiner explained there is no objective evidence of any direct, causal relationship or any "aggravational" relationship between PTSD and OSA. Id. The opinion relies on the absence of objective medical evidence documenting a causal or "aggravational" relationship between PTSD and OSA without considering the Veteran's competent, credible lay statements. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The July 2023 opinion fails to acknowledge the April 2023 medical opinion provided by J.B., a psychiatric nurse, which indicates the Veteran's PTSD and OSA are related, and PTSD stressors contributed to the development of OSA. The opinion is therefore not based on a review of the Veteran's lay statements and medical records. See Nieves- Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304 (2008). The opinion is not consistent with the other probative evidence of record. Accordingly, the July 2023 VA examination and medical opinion are inadequate and afforded minimal probative weight. 

A February 2024 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with OSA and opined that OSA is less likely than not related to service-connected PTSD. See February 2024 VA Examination. The rationale explained the Veteran was diagnosed with OSA in 2014, but the Veteran did not become service-connected for PTSD until 2020. Id. The February 2024 opinion is based on factual inaccuracies. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993). The rationale indicates the Veteran's OSA could not have developed secondary to PTSD, because the Veteran was not service-connected for PTSD until 2020, but the date of the Veteran's service connection for PTSD is not relevant. See February 2024 VA Examination. The date of the Veteran's psychiatric diagnosis is relevant. If the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD or another psychiatric illness before he was diagnosed with OSA, it is possible that PTSD caused or aggravated OSA, and the examiner's rationale is factually inaccurate. Here, VA treatment records show the Veteran's psychiatric illness was diagnosed as mood disorder at a November 2012 psychosocial assessment, and the Veteran's referral to VA's sleep clinic was prompted by the November 2012 psychosocial assessment. Id. Thus, the Veteran's psychiatric diagnosis led to the Veteran's referral to VA's sleep clinic. As such, the February 2024 VA opinion is based on factual inaccuracies. See Reonal, 5 Vet. App. at 461 (1993). 

The February 2024 examiner discussed medical literature that indicates medications fall into three categories as they relate to OSA - medications that do not affect OSA, medications that worsen OSA, and medications that improve OSA. See February 2024 VA Examination. The medical literature indicates benzodiazepines, opioids, muscle relaxants, and male hormones adversely affect OSA. Id. The examiner noted that the Veteran is not prescribed benzodiazepines, opioids, muscle relaxants, or male hormones, and the examiner stated that the Veteran's medications would not cause OSA. Id. The examiner did not explain which of the three described categories the Veteran's medications fall into - medications that do not affect OSA, medications that worsen OSA, or medications that improve OSA. Id. In doing so, the examiner addressed causation but not aggravation. See El-Amin, 26 Vet. App. at 138 (2013). The February 2024 VA opinion is also inconsistent with the other probative evidence of record. As such, the February 2024 VA finding are accorded no probative weight.

For the above reasons, the probative evidence weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran's OSA developed secondary to, or was aggravated by, the Veteran's service-connected PTSD. Service connection for OSA, as secondary to PTSD, is therefore warranted. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
