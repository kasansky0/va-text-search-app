REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1997 to July 2001 and from February 2003 to August 2004.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2022 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The March 2022 rating decision is a Higher-Level Review (HLR) decision, issued in response to a March 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, which requested review of a March 2021 decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).   

In the March 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2021 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD

By way of history, a November 2019 rating decision granted service connection for GERD with an evaluation of 10 percent, effective May 23, 2019.  In November 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested, in pertinent part, readjudication of the rating assigned for GERD.  Subsequently, the March 2021 rating decision continued the 10 precent rating assigned for the Veteran's service-connected GERD.  As noted above, the Veteran then submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) in March 2022, and a March 2022 decision subsequently continued the 10 percent for service-connected GERD.

The Veteran and his representative contend that the Veteran's GERD symptoms are productive of considerable impairment of health such that a disability rating of at least 30 percent is warranted.  They also contend that the January 2021 VA examination is inadequate for rating purposes because it impermissibly considered the ameliorative effects of medication that the Veteran takes daily for his GERD.  See March 2023 VA Form 10182.  

For the reasons that follow, the Board agrees that that the January 2021 VA examination is insufficient for rating purposes and finds that remand is warranted to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error and to obtain a VA medical opinion consistent with the directives herein.  

In January 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to ascertain the current severity and symptomology of his GERD.  The examiner endorsed that the Veteran had to following signs and symptoms due to his GERD: dysphagia, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, sleep disturbance caused by esophageal reflux 4 or more times per year lasting less than 1 day, nausea 4 or more times per year lasting less than 1 day, and vomiting 4 or more times per times per year lasting less than 1 day.  The Board notes that "symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health" and "symptoms combination productive of severe impairment of health," were included in the "signs and symptoms" checklist on the examination report but were not endorsed by the examiner.  However, no opinion or explanation was given regarding why the examiner did not endorse that the Veteran's symptoms were productive of considerable or severe impairment of health.  See January 2021 VA examination report.  The Board finds that remand is required to obtain such clarification and explanation.  

At the January 2021 VA examination, the Veteran's treatment plan was noted to include taking continuous medication for his GERD consisting of 40mg of pantoprazole once a day.  When assigning a disability rating, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication where those effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria.  Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).  The Board notes that the pre-May 19, 2024, rating criteria for Diagnostic Code 7346, under which the Veteran's GERD is rated, do not contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication.  Consequently, the Board finds that a remand is also needed for a medical opinion as to the severity of the Veteran's GERD without the use of Pantoprazole or other medications used to control symptoms.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum medical opinion from the examiner who conducted the January 2021 VA esophageal examination or, if that examiner is unavailable then another similarly qualified examiner may respond instead.  The entire claims file, including a copy of this remand, must be made available for review by the examiner, and such review should be noted in the examination report.  A new VA examination is only necessary if deemed so by the examiner.

The examiner should opine as to the severity of the Veteran's GERD at the time of the January 2021 examination, without considering the ameliorative effects of medication.  Specifically, the examiner must respond to the following:

(a.) At the time of the January 2021 VA examination, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that, without his medication, the Veteran would have experienced symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss, and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health?

(b.) If not, at the time of the January 2021 VA examination, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that, without his medication, the Veteran would have experienced persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health?

The examiner must provide a comprehensive rationale for each proffered opinion.  The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history, and such reports are to be considered in formulating any opinion.

If any opinion cannot be given without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why and state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner does not have the knowledge or training.
