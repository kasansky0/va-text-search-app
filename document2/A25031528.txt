ORDER

The appeal for accrued benefits is dismissed.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran died in April 2022.  

2. The Appellant has been substituted as the appellant in a separate appeal addressing the claims pending at the time of the Veteran's death.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for accrued benefits have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from May 1973 to March 1975.  He died in April 2022.  The Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse.

In February 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for cause of death and entitlement to accrued benefits.  In July 2023, the Appellant submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Appellant would like Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, and submit or identify this evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, as the Board is remanding the claim to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Dismissal

The Veteran died in April 2022.  At the time of his death in April 2022, the Veteran's November 2019 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, from the denial of service connection for asthma, congestive heart failure, Type II diabetes mellitus, declining vision, enlarged prostate, hypertension, kidney stones and kidney damage, leukocytosis, a lumbosacral spine disability, plantar fasciitis, a bilateral ankle disability, rheumatoid arthritis, and sleep apnea and compensable ratings for right foot injury residuals and left thumb injury residuals was pending.  In September 2022, the Appellant submitted both an Application for DIC, Survivors Pension, and/or Accrued Benefits, VA Form 21 534EZ, seeking accrued benefits and a Request for Substitution of Claimant upon Death of Claimant, VA Form 21P-0847.  In July 2023, the Appellant was substituted as the appellant as to the issues noted in the November 2019 VA Form 10182.  The Appellant was informed of her right to waive substitution in favor of pursuing a claim for accrued benefits but did not elect to do so.  In September 2023, the Board, in a separate decision, remanded the Appellant's appeal to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction for additional action.

Substitution is essentially another avenue to seek accrued benefits by continuing the pending issues to completion of the appellate process.  See Reliford v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 297, 301 (2015).  As the Appellant has been substituted in as to the claims pending at the Veteran's death, the appeal as to entitlement to accrued benefits is duplicative and must therefore be dismissed.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is remanded.

The Appellant asserts that service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is warranted as the fatal coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, Type II diabetes mellitus, and COPD are related to active service and caused his demise.

VA should obtain all relevant VA and private treatment records which could potentially be helpful in resolving the Appellant's claim.  Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78 (1990); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).

The April 2022 death certificate indicates that the "immediate cause of death was coronary artery disease due to or as a consequence of congestive heart failure due to or as a consequence of diabetes mellitus."  The Veteran was noted to have died at Griffin Hospital.  The clinical documentation associated with the Veteran's final treatment has not been requested for incorporation into the record.  That is a pre decisional error. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Request that the Appellant complete a VA Form 21-4142 for Griffin Hospital to obtain clinical documentation associated with the Veteran's final treatment.  Make two requests for any authorized records from all identified healthcare providers unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.
