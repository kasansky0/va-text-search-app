ORDER

The reduction to 20 percent from April 6, 2023, being improper, restoration of a 40 percent rating for service-connected T-9 compression fracture, status post lumbar decompression L3 - L5 and lumbar fusion, with intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and degenerative arthritis, is granted.

Entitlement to a 40 percent disability rating, but no higher, for right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve is granted.

Entitlement to a 40 percent disability rating, but no higher, for left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve is granted.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) based on a single service-connected disability is denied.

Basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine disability has improved under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

2. The Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve is manifested by incomplete paralysis with moderately severe symptoms but without muscular atrophy.

3. The Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve is manifested by incomplete paralysis with moderately severe symptoms but without muscular atrophy.

4. A single service-connected disability alone did not render the Veteran unable to obtain or retain substantially gainful employment.

5. The Veteran is permanently and totally disabled.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for restoration of the Veteran's 40 percent disability rating for service-connected T-9 compression fracture, status post lumbar decompression L3 - L5 and lumbar fusion, with IVDS and degenerative arthritis, effective April 6, 2023, have been met.   38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.

2. The criteria for an increased rating of 40 percent, but no higher, for right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

3. The criteria for an increased rating of 40 percent, but no higher, for left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

4. The criteria for entitlement to TDIU based on a single service-connected disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.3, 4.16.

5. The criteria for basic eligibility to DEA under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3020, 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1996 to July 1999.  He appeals a February 2024 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) reducing his disability rating from 40 to 20 percent for a back disability from April 6, 2023.  The AOJ also denied increased ratings greater than 10 percent for the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve.

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2023 rating decision reducing his back disability rating to 20 percent, and review of a December 2022 rating decision denying increased ratings for his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve.  In February 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior December 2022 and May 2023 rating decisions.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a).

Rating Restoration

As stated above, the Veteran's disability rating for his back disability was reduced.  In this case, a rating reduction is proper when the evidence shows improvement in the Veteran's back disability under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

The Supreme Court in Brown v. Brown concluded that "in any rating-reduction case not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred but also that that improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work." 5 Vet. App. 413, 421 (1993).

Significantly, in a rating reduction case, VA has the burden of establishing that the disability has improved.  This is in stark contrast to a case involving a claim for an increased (i.e., higher) rating, in which it is the veteran's responsibility to show the disability has worsened.  A rating reduction case focuses on the propriety of the reduction and is not the same as an increased rating issue.  See Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282, 286 (1991).  Medical and non-medical indicators of improvement may be considered.  See Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 349 (2000).

Having reviewed the evidence of record, the Board finds that restoration of the 40 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected back disability from April 6, 2023, is warranted.

The Veteran's back disability is currently rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243, for intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS).  Diagnostic Code 5243 provides that IVDS is to be rated either under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine or under the Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes, whichever method results in the higher rating when all disabilities are combined under 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.

The Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes provides that a 20 percent rating is warranted for IVDS with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks during the past 12 months.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for IVDS with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks during the past 12 months.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  

Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 5243 provides that, for purposes of ratings under Diagnostic Code 5243, an incapacitating episode is a period of acute signs and symptoms due to intervertebral disc syndrome that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.  Id.  at Note 1.  

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

Ankylosis is defined as "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure."  Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 94 (32nd ed. 2012).  Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.  Id.  at Note 5.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, may not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) 

In an April 2022 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found the Veteran's forward flexion was to 30 degrees or less.  See April 2022 rating decision.  There is no clear and unmistakable error in this finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

In the May 2023 reduction decision, the AOJ found that the Veteran's back disability "improved" as shown in October 2022 and April 2023 VA examination reports.  See May 2023 rating decision.  

However, the Veteran had back surgery in 2021 and continued to have pain requiring the use of at least four medications; further, he had limitations in his activities of daily living (ADL).  See October 2022 VA examination report.  Further, he had difficulties in lifting, bending, standing, and walking.  Id.  These symptoms and functional limitations continued at his April 2023 VA examination.  Importantly, neither the October 2022 nor the April 2023 VA examiners discounted the ameliorative effects of the Veteran's four medications in determining his additional functional loss as required in precedential case law, which was most recently affirmed in Ingram v. Collins.  See 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (Mar. 12, 2025).

Accordingly, the record reflects the Veteran's back condition did not improve under his ordinary conditions of life, and the October 2022 and April 2023 VA examinations were inadequate.

As noted above, in reduction cases, the burden of proof lies with VA to show that the Veteran's disability has undergone an observable improvement.  To be precise, the burden is on VA to establish by a preponderance of evidence that the rating reduction was warranted.  See Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 421 (1993).  As there is conflicting evidence as to whether the Veteran's disability has improved when considering additional functional loss, and the VA examinations upon which VA based the reduction were inadequate, the Board finds that VA has not met its burden and that the reduction in the Veteran's disability evaluation for his back disability was improper.  The 40 percent rating is therefore restored from April 6, 2023.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  

Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, consideration of the medical evidence since the effective date of the award of service connection is required.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 199, 125-26 (1999).  Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings," whether it is an initial rating case or not.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  

Importantly, the evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses is to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  However, when it is not possible to separate the effects of the service-connected disability from a nonservice-connected condition, such signs and symptoms must be attributed to the service-connected disability.  Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181, 182 (1998); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy is rated under Diagnostic Code 8520.  Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling.  Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

For the purposes of this adjudication, "mild" means limited sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area; "moderate" means motor or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes graded higher than mild.  "Moderately severe" means motor and/or reflex impairment at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation.  "Severe" means motor/reflex impairment at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation.  

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than complete paralysis with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

A January 2022 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve was moderately severe.  See January 2022 VA examination report.  His muscle strength was normal, and he did not exhibit muscle atrophy.  However, he had decreased sensation of his bilateral lower extremities during testing.  Nevertheless, the Veteran did not use any assistive devices as a normal mode of locomotion because of his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  See October and January 2022 VA examination reports.

Therefore, the record showed moderately severe bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy symptoms.  As his muscle strength was normal, he did not exhibit muscle atrophy, and did not use any assistive devices as a normal mode of locomotion because of his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, the Board finds the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximate motor and/or reflex impairment at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation instead of a very high level of limitation.  As a result, a rating higher than 40 percent is not warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  See October 2023 VA Form 20-0996.

Thus, the criteria for an increased rating of 40 percent, but no higher, for right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve have been met.  Further, the criteria for an increased rating of 40 percent, but no higher, for left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve have been met.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

TDIU

Pursuant to the Order above, the Veteran is rated at a schedular 100 percent combined throughout the appeal period.  The Court has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the rating schedule indicates that a Veteran is totally disabled.  Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994).  Thus, if VA has found a Veteran to be totally disabled because of a particular service-connected disability or combination of disabilities pursuant to the rating schedule, there is no need, and no authority, to otherwise rate that Veteran totally disabled on any other basis.  See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding a request for TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period).

However, a grant of a 100 percent disability rating does not always render the issue of TDIU moot.  VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether his or her disabilities establish entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).  Specifically, SMC may be warranted if a Veteran has a 100 percent disability rating for a "single disability," and TDIU for a sole disability may satisfy this requirement.  See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 292.

Nevertheless, as the use of "one disability" in the TDIU context was to assist certain veterans in reaching the baseline disability rating requirements to benefit from 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), no other purpose can be read into the regulation, including retaining the "one disability" designation to establish "a service-connected disability rated as total" for SMC eligibility.  See Youngblood v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 412, 417 (2019).  In other words, the Court rejected the idea that primary and derivative service-connected disorders are to be considered one disability for purposes of TDIU and SMC.  As a result, a back disability and radiculopathy of each extremity are each supposed to be considered separately for purposes of a single disability to satisfy SMC.

Here, the Veteran has not argued, and the evidentiary record does not show, that he cannot work because of a single service-connected disability alone.  Rather, the Veteran has argued that he cannot work because of the combination of his back disability and radiculopathy.  See January 2022 VA examination report.  (Emphasis added).  As a result, entitlement to TDIU based on a single, service-connected disability is denied.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

DEA

VA's regulations require VA to "render a decision which grants every benefit that can be supported by law while protecting the interests of the Government."  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(a); see also Bradley 22 Vet. App. at 294.

Because the Board has determined that the Veteran is entitled to a 100 percent schedular rating throughout the appeal period, his service-connected disabilities render him permanently and total disabled, and basic eligibility to DEA is warranted.  38 U.S.C. Ch. 35; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.
