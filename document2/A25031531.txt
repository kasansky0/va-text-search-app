2. The Veteran's bilateral dry eye syndrome is a disorder of the lacrimal apparatus with ongoing symptoms of dry eyes treated with artificial tears. 

3. Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's service-connected surgical scars of the left knee have not been associated with underlying soft tissue damage and do not cover an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 centimeters cm.) or greater.

4. Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's service-connected surgical scars of left knee are manifested by two scars that are painful, but not unstable.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an initial 20 percent disability rating for service-connected dry eye syndrome have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6099-6025.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an initial, compensable disability rating for service-connected surgical scars of the left knee have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

4. The criteria for entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected painful left knee surgical scars have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2002 to April 2022, with service in Kuwait and Afghanistan.  He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal.  The Board thanks the Veteran for his service.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2022 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) higher-level review rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that considered the evidence of record as of the date of an April 2022 rating decision. In November 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 requesting Direct Review as the review option.

Based on the Veteran's election, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the April 2022 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Any additional evidence associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed has not been considered. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for residuals of kidney stones, left ankle pain, right ankle pain, right knee pain, and syncope, heart, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent medical or lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Service connection generally will be awarded when a veteran has a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a link ("nexus") between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

For the chronic diseases listed in 38 U.S.C. § 1101 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), which include hypertension as a cardiovascular-renal disease, service connection may alternatively be established with evidence of chronicity of the disease during service or during a presumptive period following service separation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012 (holding that only the chronic diseases listed in § 1101 of the statute and § 3.309(a) of the regulations are subject to the provisions of § 3.303(b)). For conditions noted during service (or in the presumptive period) but not shown to be chronic at the time, a continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

To establish service connection for a chronic disease based on a continuity of symptoms, the following elements must be satisfied: (1) a condition "noted" during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of the same symptoms; and (3) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptoms. Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 263-264 (2015).

When chronicity or continuity of symptomatology of a chronic disease is established as set forth above, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, no matter how remote in time from the period of service, will be service connected unless clearly attributable to causes unrelated to service ("intercurrent" causes). 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

In addition, where a veteran served continuously for 90 days or more during a period of war, or after December 31, 1946, there is a presumption of service connection for cardiovascular-renal disease, including hypertension, if the disease manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service, even if there is no evidence of the disease during the service period itself. 38 U.S.C. § § 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). This presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d).

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance-which includes but is not limited to equipoise-the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021). If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt-rule does not apply. Id. at 781-82.

The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for hypertension. For the following reasons and bases, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for hypertension is not warranted.

Hypertension for VA purposes means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90 or more, or systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160 or more.  Hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on three different days. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104 Diagnostic Code 7101, Note (1).  The Board notes that words such as "predominantly" are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  "Predominantly" is defined as "for the most part," or "mainly."  See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 978 (11th ed. 2012).

Here, the Veteran's service treatment records show numerous elevated blood pressure readings.  In October 2011, he was diagnosed as having hypertension and prescribed hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).  However, he did not continue to take the medication.  While hypertension remained on the Veteran's problem list throughout service, there was no follow up, further treatment, or prescription of medication for hypertension throughout the remainder of the Veteran's service ending in April 2022, so for more than 10 years.

As noted above, with chronic disease shown as such in service so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, no matter how remote in time from the period of service, will be service connected unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  Here, however, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of hypertension and has not had one at any time during the filing of the claim or the pendency of the appeal. See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013) (noting that "an appellant must have a current disability at the time he or she filed his or her claim"); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007) (noting that the "current disability" required for service connection includes a disability at the time of filing or during the pendency of a claim).

Prior to his separation from service, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for hypertension on November 16, 2021.  The examiner noted the Veteran's medical 

?

history, to include the October 2011 service treatment record reflecting treatment for hypertension and the prescription for HCTZ. The Veteran reported that he could not recall any symptoms, but that he was diagnosed in 2011. He reported that the condition was treated with diet, less salt, and stress management. The Veteran reported that he had no current symptoms of hypertension. The examiner noted that the Veteran was asked about the prescription for HCTZ, which the Veteran reported was only given in 2011.  The examiner recorded the following blood pressure readings: on November 16, 2021, three readings were completed: 126/86, 112/79, and 124/86.  On January 6, 2022, three readings were completed: 135/89, 138/92, and 132/84. On January 7, 2022, three readings were completed: 146/91, 144/88, and 128/88. The examiner concluded that based on the Veteran's blood pressure readings, he did not fulfill the criteria for a diagnosis of hypertension and that there was no current diagnosis of hypertension. 

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension cannot be established without evidence of a current disability.  Here, there is no probative evidence of a current diagnosis of hypertension.  The Board finds the November 2021 VA examiner's opinion that the Veteran does not have hypertension to be probative, as it was based upon a review of his records and blood pressure readings taken two or more times on three different days. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104 Diagnostic Code 7101, Note (1).  There is no evidence showing treatment or a diagnosis of a hypertension condition after service, and the Veteran has denied any current symptoms of hypertension for the entire period on appeal.  Thus, there is no indication of any symptoms causing functional impairment of earning capacity.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

In sum, the probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of hypertension. See Davidson, 581 F.3d 1313.  As the persuasive evidence is against the claim, the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal; therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied.  See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82; 38 U.S.C.   § 5107.

2. Entitlement to an initial 20 percent disability rating for service-connected dry eye syndrome is granted.

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and increase in disability rating is at issue, present level of disability is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). 

Because the level of disability may have varied over the course of the claim, the rating may be "staged" higher or lower for segments of time during the period under review in accordance with such variations, to the extent they are sufficient to warrant changes in the evaluations assignable under the applicable rating criteria. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). For increased-rating claims, where a claimant seeks a higher evaluation for a previously service-connected disability, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern, and VA considers the level of disability for the period beginning one year prior to the claim for a higher rating. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

Where there is a question as to which of the two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Veteran is in receipt of a noncompensable rating for his service-connected dry eye syndrome. He asserts that the severity of his disability warrants a higher rating. For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that a 20 percent rating is warranted.

Evaluation of ocular impairment is generally based upon disability measured by loss of visual acuity, disability measured by loss of field vision, or based on incapacitating episodes caused by the service-connected eye disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.75, 4.76, 4.77, 4.79, 4.84a.  As an initial matter, the evidence does not suggest, nor has the Veteran asserted, that he has loss of visual acuity, disability measured by loss of field vision, or incapacitating episodes.

The Veteran's dry eye syndrome is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6099-6025. The use of two rating codes and a "99" denotes a rating by analogy. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4.27. Pursuant to Diagnostic Code 6025, disorders of the lacrimal apparatus, such as epiphora (excessive watering of the eye) or dacryocystitis (infection of the lacrimal sac), are rated 10 percent if unilateral, and 20 percent if bilateral. This 20 percent rating is the highest schedular disability rating provided under this Diagnostic Code.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for his claimed condition in December 2021, where he reported burning dry eyes and that it felt like there was sand in his eyes. The examiner assessed him with bilateral dry eye syndrome, diagnosed in 2006. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran used over the counter artificial tear drops to treat his dry eyes.  Further, the examiner noted that there was no decrease in visual acuity or other visual impairment, or any incapacitating episodes, associated with the Veteran's dry eye syndrome.

The assignment of a particular Diagnostic Code is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case." Butts v Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993). The AOJ, in already rating the Veteran under Diagnostic Code 6025, seemingly agrees. In this case, however, the medical evidence throughout the appeal period shows that the Veteran's service-connected disability does not cause loss of visual acuity, loss of field vision, or incapacitating episodes, and for this reason the AOJ has assigned a noncompensable disability rating for this disability.

Based on the above, however, the Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral eye condition is a disorder of the lacrimal apparatus, as evidenced by the Veteran's dry eyes with a history and recommended use of eyedrops.  Consequently, affording the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran, the Board finds that his disability meets the criteria for a 20 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6025, bilateral disorder of the lacrimal apparatus. This is the highest rating available under Diagnostic Code 6025. 

In conclusion, affording the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran, the criteria for a 20 percent rating have been met and the claim is granted. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6025.

3. Entitlement to an initial, compensable disability rating for service-connected left knee surgical scars is denied.

4. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected painful left knee surgical scars is denied. 

Scars are rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7800-7805.  The Veteran has been assigned two, separate ratings for his left knee surgical scars: (1) a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7804 based upon two painful scars, and (2) a noncompensable disability rating under Diagnostic Code 7802 based upon the size of the area covered by the two scars.  

Initially, as concerning the rating for the Veteran's service-connected surgical scars of the left knee, the Board points out that Diagnostic Code 7800 does not apply, as it pertains to scars of the head, face, and neck, so not the left lower extremity.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800.

Diagnostic Code 7801 provides ratings for scars not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for a scar or scars covering an area or areas of at least 6 square inches (39 square cm.), but less that 12 square inches (77 square cm.).  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7801.

Diagnostic Code 7802, pertains to scars not of the head, face, or neck that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for a scar or scars covering an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 square cm.) or greater.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802.

Diagnostic Code 7804 provides that one or two scars that are unstable or painful are rated as 10 percent disabling. Three or four scars that are unstable or painful are rated as 20 percent disabling. Five or more scars that are unstable or painful are rated as 30 percent disabling. Note (1) to Diagnostic Code 7804 explains that an unstable scar was one where, for any reason, there was frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. Note (2) explains that 10 percent may be added to the evaluation if one or more scars are both unstable and painful.

Under Diagnostic Code 7805, any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating under Codes 7800-04 are to be rated under an appropriate Code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7805.  

The November 2021 VA examiner noted the Veteran had two scars on the left knee, each measuring 1 centimeter long by 0.1 centimeter wide. The total area of both scars of the left lower extremity combined was 0.2 square centimeter. The examiner noted the two scars were painful but not unstable. The examiner further noted that the two scars were not associated with underlying tissue damage. 

As the Veteran's two scars of the left lower extremity are not associated with underlying tissue damage, a compensable disability rating under Diagnostic Code 7801 is not warranted.  

As the Veteran's two scars of the left lower extremity have a combined total area of 0.2 square centimeter, that is, less than 929 square centimeters, a compensable disability rating under Diagnostic Code 7802 is not warranted.

Further, the Veteran is not entitled to a higher disability rating under Diagnostic Code 7804, as the evidence does not show that he has more than two painful scars.  Only two surgical scars are present on the Veteran's left knee.  Further, the VA examiner noted that the scars were not unstable; therefore, an additional 10 percent rating may not be added to the evaluation.

Finally, the Veteran's two scars of the left knee do not have any other disabling effects not considered in a rating under Codes 7800-04 to warrant a separate rating under Diagnostic Code 7805.  The November 2021 VA examiner stated that the scars did not result in limitation of motion or function, and that there were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms.  There is no lay or medical evidence showing any disabling effects of the Veteran's scars, apart from the pain compensated by the 10 percent rating assigned under DC 7804.

In sum, based on the above, the criteria for an initial, compensable disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected left knee scars under DC 7802 have not been met.  Further, the criteria for an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected left knee painful scars under DC 7804 have not been met.  As the persuasive evidence is against the claims, the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal; therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claims are denied.  See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82; 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for residuals of kidney stones is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left ankle pain is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for right ankle pain is remanded.

4. Entitlement to service connection for right knee pain is remanded.

5. Entitlement to service connection for syncope, heart is remanded.

The Veteran maintains that he suffers from residuals of kidney stones, left ankle pain, right ankle pain, right knee pain, and a syncope/heart disorder related to active service. See November 2021 Statement in Support of Claim.  

The Veteran underwent VA examinations for each of the above claimed conditions in November 2021, where the examiner found that he did not have a diagnosis of each claimed disability. While there is no current medical evidence of a diagnosis of the above claimed conditions, the Veteran has reported that he has pain associated with each condition.  The current disability requirement can be met where there are symptoms of a disorder that cause functional impairment. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding that a "disability" under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 refers to functional impairment of earning capacity; pain need not be diagnosed as connected to a current underlying condition to function as an impairment.).

Therefore, the Board finds that the November 2021 VA examinations are inadequate, as the examiner(s) did not consider whether the Veteran had diagnosed disabilities pursuant to Saunders.  The Board also notes that the Veteran's STRs show treatment for each of his claimed conditions.  See Favorable Findings in the October 2022 rating decision.  

Further, the Veteran served in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations, to include Kuwait, after August 2, 1990.  Thus, he qualifies as a "Persian Gulf veteran." See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e).  Although he has not asserted that his claimed right and left ankle disorders, right knee disorder, kidney disorder, and heart disorder may be manifestations of an undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (MUCMI) based on his Persian Gulf service, the record reasonably raises this issue.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(b) (listing symptoms, but not limited to, of joint pain and muscle pain and cardiovascular signs or symptoms as possible signs or symptoms of an undiagnosed illness).  Accordingly, additional VA medical examinations and opinions are warranted on these issues.

In light of the foregoing, a remand is required to schedule the Veteran for additional examinations for his claimed disabilities. The AOJ's failure to obtain adequate VA examinations constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Further, the November 2021 VA examination reports note that x-rays were conducted of the Veteran's ankles and right knee.  However, these x-ray reports are not included in the file.  Therefore, they must be obtained on remand.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain copies of the x-ray reports of the Veteran's right and left ankles and right knee conducted in conjunction with the November 2021 VA examinations.

2. Schedule an appropriate VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed left ankle, right ankle, and right knee disabilities. The entire claims file and a copy of this REMAND must be made available to the examiner in conjunction with the examination.

Any indicated tests and studies must be accomplished, and all clinical findings must be reported in detail and correlated to a specific diagnosis.

The examiner should elicit a full history from the Veteran, to include a description of his in-service symptoms, as well as any continuing symptoms since service.

The examiner is requested to opine as to the following:

(a) The examiner should identify whether the Veteran has any diagnosed right ankle, left ankle, and/or right knee disorders.   

If a right ankle, left ankle, and/or right knee disorder diagnosis cannot be provided but the Veteran's condition manifests in symptoms (pain, limited motion, etc.) that cause functional impairment, then the examiner should consider it a "disability" for the purpose of providing the requested opinion below.

(b) For any diagnosed right ankle, left ankle, and/or right knee disorder, and/or any right ankle, left ankle, and/or right knee symptoms resulting in functional impairment of earning capacity, the examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the condition had its onset during service or is related to any incident of service.

In formulating these opinions, the examiner should consider the following:

"	The service treatment record dated October 7, 2016 showing that the Veteran twisted his left ankle and had complaints of pain, limited motion, and swelling, with a diagnosis of sprain; 

"	The Veteran's symptoms of right ankle pain during service, which are conceded;

"	The service treatment record dated June 21, 2019 showing complaints of right knee pain, for which the Veteran underwent physical therapy; and

"	The service treatment record dated May 20, 2020 showing complaints of chronic right knee pain and instability, with MRI findings of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the medial femoral condyle and surrounding bone marrow edema.

(c) If right ankle, left ankle, and/or right knee disorders are not diagnosed, is the Veteran's joint and/or muscle pain in the ankles and right knee due to an undiagnosed illness?

(d) If the Veteran's joint and/or muscle pain in the ankles and right knee is a manifestation of a diagnosed illness, is the diagnosed illness a medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (MUCMI) that is defined by a cluster of signs and symptoms, i.e., fibromyalgia?

The examiner must include a complete rationale for all opinions provided.

3.  Schedule an appropriate VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed kidney disability. The entire claims file and a copy of this REMAND must be made available to the examiner in conjunction with the examination.

Any indicated tests and studies must be accomplished, and all clinical findings must be reported in detail and correlated to a specific diagnosis.

The examiner should elicit a full history from the Veteran, to include a description of his in-service symptoms, as well as any continuing symptoms since service.

The examiner is requested to opine as to the following:

(a) The examiner should identify whether the Veteran has a diagnosed kidney disorder.   

If a kidney diagnosis cannot be provided but the Veteran's condition manifests in symptoms (pain, etc.) that cause functional impairment, then the examiner should consider it a "disability" for the purpose of providing the requested opinion below.  

The examiner should consider the Veteran's statement on VA examination in November 2021 that he had pain in his right mid-section that made it difficult to work, sit still, concentrate, or drive.  The examiner should explain whether the Veteran's reported pain in his right mid-section is related to his kidney or has a different etiology.

(b) For any diagnosed kidney disorder, and/or any kidney symptoms resulting in functional impairment of earning capacity, the examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the condition had its onset during service or is related to any incident of service, to include the Veteran's treatment for kidney stones in January 2017.  

(c) Does the Veteran have any residuals of his kidney stone removal procedure conducted in January 2017?

(d) If a kidney disorder is not diagnosed, is the Veteran's pain in his pain in his right mid-section due to an undiagnosed illness?

The examiner must include a complete rationale for all opinions provided.

4.  Schedule an appropriate VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed syncope/ heart condition. The entire claims file and a copy of this REMAND must be made available to the examiner in conjunction with the examination.

Any indicated tests and studies must be accomplished, and all clinical findings must be reported in detail and correlated to a specific diagnosis.

The examiner should elicit a full history from the Veteran, to include a description of his in-service symptoms, as well as any continuing symptoms since service.

The examiner is requested to opine as to the following:

(a) The examiner should identify whether the Veteran has a diagnosed syncope/heart disorder.  The examiner should consider the October 2021 test showing sinus bradycardia and the December 2021 transthoracic echocardiogram showing mild mitral regurgitation and insufficient tricuspid regurgitation and explain whether these findings show the presence of a current heart/syncope disorder. 

If a syncope/heart disorder diagnosis cannot be provided but the Veteran's condition manifests in symptoms (pain, etc.) that cause functional impairment, then the examiner should consider it a "disability" for the purpose of providing the requested opinion below.

The examiner should also consider the Veteran's statement on VA examination in November 2021 that he had pain in his chest/heart area.  The examiner should explain whether the Veteran's reported pain in his chest/heart area is related to his heart or has a different etiology.

(b) For any diagnosed syncope/heart disorder, and/or syncope/heart symptoms resulting in functional impairment of earning capacity, the examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the condition had its onset during service or is related to any incident of service, to include the Veteran's syncope treated during service in January 2008 and/or the findings of sinus bradycardia and mild mitral regurgitation and insufficient tricuspid regurgitation documented in 2021.

(c) If a syncope/heart disorder is not diagnosed, is the Veteran's pain in his chest/heart area due to an undiagnosed illness?

The examiner must include a complete rationale for all opinions provided.
