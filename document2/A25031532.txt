ORDER

An effective date earlier than October 24, 2022, for the award of service connection for a lumbar spine disability is denied.

An effective date earlier than October 24, 2022, for the award of service connection for tinnitus is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Service connection for a lumbar spine disability was denied in a February 2005 rating decision that became final.  Notice of the February 2005 rating decision is presumed to have been sent to both the appellant and his representative, and the Veteran has not submitted clear evidence to the contrary to rebut this presumption.  

2. Following the February 2005 rating decision, a complete claim for the issue of service connection for a lumbar spine disability was not received prior to October 26, 2022 intent to file followed by a complete claim received within a year.

3. There is no argument or indication that the Veteran submitted a claim of service connection for tinnitus (or otherwise raised the issue) at any point prior to October 26, 2022.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than October 24, 2022, for the award of service connection for a lumbar spine disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than October 24, 2022, for the award of service connection for tinnitus are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1999 to November 2004.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2023 rating decision.

In his July 2024 VA Form 10182 (notice of disagreement), the Veteran referenced the July 2023 decision and elected the Board's Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 24, 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the July 24, 2023 AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the present claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. An effective date earlier than October 24, 2022, for the award of service connection for a lumbar spine disability is denied.

The July 2023 decision on appeal granted service connection for a lumbar spine disability, effective October 24, 2022.  The Veteran is appealing the effective date.

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after discharge from service.  Otherwise, for an award based on an original claim, claim reopened after a final disallowance, or claim for an increased rating, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A review of the record shows that, on October 1, 2004, VA received a claim of service connection for acute lumbar strain.  This claim was denied in a February 2005 rating decision.  VA provided notice of this decision via a notification letter date February 22, 2005.  There is no argument or indication that the Veteran appealed the February 2005 rating decision or that new and material evidence was received within one year after notice of the decision.  Therefore, the February 2005 denial of service connection for a lumbar spine disability became final.

Following the February 2005 rating decision, the Veteran next raised the issue of service connection for a back disability in March 2020, when he submitted a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  

In April 2020, the AOJ sent a notification letter to the Veteran, informing him that VA had recently changed its review process and that, for VA to begin processing his request of review of the previously denied claim, he needed to file his request using the proper form.  There is, however, no argument or indication that the Veteran submitted a proper form, to include a supplemental claim, within one year after VA received the file using the incorrect form.  (Had the Veteran submitted a claim using the correct form within one year after receipt of the March 2020 fully developed claim, the latter claim would have been considered as filed on the date that the March 2020 fully developed claim was received.  See 38 C.F.R § 3.155(c).)

Next, VA received an intent to file in April 2021.  No claim, however, was received within one year after receipt of the intent to file.  (Had the Veteran submitted a claim within one year after receipt of the intent to file, that claim would have been considered as filed on the date of the intent to file.  See 38 C.F.R § 3.155(b).)

On October 24, 2022, VA received another intent to file, which was followed by a supplemental claim in March 2023.  This intent to file is the basis for the currently assigned effective date.

In support of his claim of an earlier effective date, the Veteran asserts that the 2005 decision was "not properly mailed" to him.  He believes that the effective date should be based on the date of his initial application from October 2004.

There is a presumption of regularity under which it is presumed that government officials have properly discharged their official duties.  Ashley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 307, 308-309 (1992).  While the Ashley case dealt with regularity in procedures at the Board, in Mindenhall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 271 (1994), the presumption of regularity was applied to procedures at the AOJ level.

The presumption of regularity is not absolute; it may be rebutted by the submission of "clear evidence to the contrary."  Evidence of nonreceipt by either the claimant or the claimant's representative, standing alone, is not the type of clear evidence to the contrary which would be sufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity.  However, where an appellant submits clear evidence to the effect that VA's "regular" mailing practices are not regular or that they were not followed, the Secretary is no longer entitled to the benefit of the presumption and the burden shifts to the Secretary to establish that the VA decision was mailed to a claimant and his or her representative, if any, as required by 38 U.S.C. § 7104(e).  Ashley, 2 Vet. App. at 308-309; see also Romero v. Tran, 33 Vet. App. 252 (2001).

As noted above, a February 2005 rating decision denied service connection for acute lumbar strain.  VA provided notice of this decision via a notification letter date February 22, 2005.  The notification letter indicates that a copy was sent to the Veteran's representative at that time.  There is, however, no indication that this letter was returned as undelivered.  Furthermore, the Veteran has not provided any details to support his assertion that the decision was "not properly mailed" to him.  

Based on the above, the Board finds that the Veteran has not submitted evidence to the effect that the regular mailing procedures were not followed in this case.  Importantly, there is no argument or indication that the relevant correspondence was either sent to the incorrect address or returned as undelivered.

Under these circumstances and applying the presumption of regularity, notice of the February 2005 rating decision is presumed to have been sent to both the appellant and his representative.  Further, the Board finds no evidence tending to rebut the presumption of regularity.  To the extent that the Veteran is asserting that he did not receive notice of the February 2005 rating decision, the Board again notes that evidence of nonreceipt by either the claimant or the claimant's representative, standing alone, is not the type of clear evidence to the contrary which would be sufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity.

As noted above, the February 2005 rating decision became final.  Therefore, for the Veteran to be entitled to an earlier effective date, the evidence must show that a complete request of review was submitted prior to October 24, 2022.  As detailed above, the Veteran submitted a request to reopen his previously denied claim of service connection for a lumbar spine in March 2020.  This request was filed using the incorrect form and could therefore not be accepted.  See 38 C.F.R §§ 3.155 (how to file a claim), 3.160(a) (complete claim).  The Veteran was informed of this deficiency and given the opportunity to correct it, but he did not submit a complete claim within one year of the March 2020 claim.  As the March 2022 claim was filed using the incorrect form and a complete claim was not received within one year, the March 2022 claim cannot be the basis of an earlier effective date. 

Thereafter, the Veteran's next submission related to his lumbar spine disability was a March 2023 supplemental claim, which was received within one year of an intent to file from October 26, 2022.

In the absence of evidence that a complete claim was received following the final February 2005 rating decision and prior to October 26, 2022, an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for the lumbar spine disability is denied.

2. An effective date earlier than October 24, 2022, for the award of service connection for tinnitus is denied.

The July 2023 decision on appeal granted service connection for a lumbar spine disability, effective October 24, 2022.  The Veteran is appealing the effective date.

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after discharge from service.  Otherwise, for an award based on an original claim, claim reopened after a final disallowance, or claim for an increased rating, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The issue of service connection for tinnitus was first raised in a March 2023 claim, which was received within one year of an intent to file from October 26, 2022.  This intent to file is the basis of the currently assigned effective date.

There is no argument or indication that the Veteran submitted a claim of service connection for tinnitus (or otherwise raised the issue) at any point prior to October 26, 2022.  In the absence of such evidence, an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for tinnitus is denied.
