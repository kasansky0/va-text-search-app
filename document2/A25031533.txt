FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is currently in receipt of the maximum rating authorized under the applicable schedular criteria for tinnitus.

2. Veteran's bilateral hearing has been manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than Level II in the right ear and no worse than Level II in the left ear.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that a headache disability, to include migraines, began during active service or are otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

4. The Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II, is related to his in-service elevated glucose.

5. The Veteran's diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities and proliferative diabetic retinopathy are complications associated with is diabetes mellitus, type II.

6. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that varicose veins began during active service or are otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

7. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that a low back disability, to include herniated discs, began during active service or are otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from March 1982 to March 1985, including service in Korea from July 1982 to July 1983, and the Navy from April 1985 to April 1989 and from April 1989 to March 1997.  The Veteran's discharge during this third period of service was characterized as "under other than honorable conditions."  The record shoes that he was deserter from June 1994 until his arrest in February 1997 and agreed to this characterization of discharge in lieu of a court martial.  Being a deserter is a statutory bar for benefits.  38 C.F.R. § 3.12(c).  Therefore, service connection cannot be established based on onset, service incurrence, or aggravation of a disease or injury during this period.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2022 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Veteran had previously been denied service connection for diabetes mellitus type II, left eye condition, varicose veins, and herniated discs.  The October 2022 rating decision on appeal adjudicated these claims on the merits before confirming and continuing the denials.  Therefore, these claims were effectively reopened as new and relevant and this decision will address only the underlying service connection claims.

In the November 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 21, 2022, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that the November 2022 VA Form 10182 also include an appeal of the issue of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  The October 2022 rating decision, however, did not address this issue.  Therefore, it is not part of the appeal currently before the Board. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the TDIU claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Motion To Advance on Docket

On 28 March 2025, the Veteran, through his appointed representative requested the Board to afford the Veteran's claims "priority processing based on his homeless status". The Board finds this to be a request to be a motion to advance the Veteran's claims on the Board's docket. 

Appeals must be considered in docket number order but may be advanced if sufficient cause is shown.  38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).  Sufficient cause includes advanced age (defined as 75 years or more), serious illness, severe financial hardship, or administrative error resulting in a significant delay in docketing the case.

The Veteran's representative asserts the Veteran is homeless and VA notes indicate the Veteran is flagged for hardship and has asserted he is homeless on numerous occasions prior to the filing of this request. 

There being no evidence or reason to question the validity or credibility of the Veteran or his representative's assertions, the Board finds the Veteran's claims should be advanced on the Board's docket for severe financial hardship. 

Increased Ratings

1. A rating higher than 10 percent for tinnitus

The Veteran was originally granted service connection for tinnitus in the October 2022 rating decision on appeal.  At that time, this disability was assigned a 10 percent rating effective July 8, 2022.  The Veteran appealed this disability rating.

The rating schedule provides for evaluating recurrent tinnitus at 10 percent, whether the sound is perceived in one ear, both ears, or the head. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6260, Note (2). A 10 percent is the highest and only rating for tinnitus provided under the rating schedule.

The Veteran has already been awarded a 10 percent rating for bilateral tinnitus, the maximum schedular rating available.  38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6260.  This diagnostic code contemplates the Veteran's reports of intermittent high frequency tinnitus.  There is no legal basis upon which to award a higher schedular disability rating.  The Board further notes that disabilities specifically listed in the rating schedule may only be rated under the DC which pertains to them.  Scott v. Wilkie, 920 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (citing Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 336 (2015)).  The claim for entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for the service-connected tinnitus must be denied in this case.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (where the law and not the evidence is dispositive, the Board should deny the claim on the ground of lack of legal merit).

2. A compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss

The Veteran was originally granted service connection for bilateral hearing loss in the October 2022 rating decision on appeal.  At that time, this disability was assigned a noncompensable (0 percent) rating effective July 8, 2022.  The Veteran appealed this disability rating.

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz).  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

To evaluate the degree of disability from bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII.  

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a).  In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Further, when the average pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b).

An August 2022 VA examination reveals that the Veteran reported difficulty hearing family members, using the phone, watching television, in groups of people, and in the presence of background noise.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10; Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007).  The Veteran's Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score and pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:  

August 8, 2022	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	30	35	50	60	44	88%

LEFT	30	35	50	45	40	86%

Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level II in the right ear and Level II in the left ear.  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level II for the right ear and Level II for the left ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a noncompensable (0 percent) disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6100.  An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

Based on the evidence above, a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is not warranted.  

The Board expressly acknowledges its consideration of the lay evidence of record when adjudicating this claim, including difficulty hearing family members, using the phone, watching television, in groups of people, and in the presence of background noise.  The Veteran is competent to report difficulty hearing; however, disability ratings for hearing loss are derived from a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations resulting from audiometric testing.  See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

The rating criteria contemplate speech reception thresholds and ability to hear spoken words on Maryland CNC testing. The functional impact that the Veteran describes, is contemplated by the rating criteria.  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).  The Veteran's main complaint is reduced hearing acuity and clarity, which is what is contemplated in the rating assigned.  See Rossy v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 142, 145 (2017).

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to a compensable rating for hearing loss.  As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Service connection for a headache disability

The Veteran is seeking service connection for a headache disability. 

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the October 2022 decision found a current diagnosis of tension headaches and an in-service complaint of headaches in February 1983.  There is no evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in any of these favorable findings and so the current disability and in-service injury elements are satisfied.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tension headaches, and evidence shows an in-service complaint of headaches, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's diagnosis of tension headaches began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The August 2022 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's tension headaches are not at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, including his in-service complaint of headaches.  The rationale was that the in-service 1983 complaint of headaches was acute with no chronicity of care.  The Veteran subsequently denied headaches in a January 1985 health questionnaire and his February 1997 report of medical history at the time of his separation exam.  The next recorded complaints of headaches were nearly twenty years later while the Veteran was seeing a chiropractor for back and neck pain.  This chiropractor noted the Veteran's complaints of intermittent headaches accompanied by neck pain. The examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

In his July 2022 claim and subsequent lay statements, the Veteran associated his headaches with a head injury in August 1982 during his service in Korea, where an immersion heater blew up in his face after he tried to light it.  This injury is not corroborated by the evidence as there was no mention of this injury in the contemporaneous medical record.  There is, however, reference to a heater blowing up in the Veteran's face in the United States.  See January 2018 VA treatment records.  This medical history notation does not associate this injury with the Veteran's military service.  Therefore, the Board does not find the Veteran's lay account of this injury to be credible.

To the extent that the Veteran reports that his current headaches are related to headaches in service, the Board finds such assertions not credible.  Headaches are lay-observable and, therefore, the Veteran is competent to provide lay evidence of their existence and their frequency since service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  In this case, however, the Board does not find the Veteran's lay assertions of an ongoing headache disability since service to be credible due to internal inconsistency and inconsistency with other evidence in the record.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  VA treatment records do not show a diagnosed chronic headache disability or ongoing complaints of headaches.  Moreover, the Veteran specifically denied both head injury and frequent headaches in his March 1985, April 1989, and February 1997 reports of medical history and no neurological abnormality was noted on his accompanying examinations.  Post-service, the Veteran first reported headaches in December 2017 when he reported nasal congestion with sinus headache pain.  At that time, the Veteran did not report a history of ongoing headaches.  Thus, the record does not contain credible lay evidence of a medical nexus between the Veteran's current headache disability and his active-duty military service.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for headache disability is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Service connection for diabetes mellitus type II

3. Service connection for bilateral upper extremities

4. Service connection for bilateral lower extremities

5. Service connection for left eye condition

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the October 2022 rating decision on appeal found a current diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type II, and he was treated for elevated glucose in 1991.  As noted in the introduction, the Veteran's other than honorable discharge as a deserter during his third period of service (April 1989-March 1997) is a statutory bar to benefits.  His elevated glucose in 1991 is during this period of service.  This is clear and unmistakable evidence against the favorable finding that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service; therefore, the in-service onset, incurrence, or injury element is not satisfied.  Nevertheless, there is no evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding of a current disability and so the current disability element is satisfied.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

Additionally, the Board notes that the October 2022 rating decision on appeal found a current diagnosis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which according to the October 2020 eye disability benefit questionnaire (DBQ) included left eye laser surgery, and age-related cataracts.  There is no evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in this favorable finding and so the current disability element is satisfied.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). 

Certain chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type II, as evidenced by his VA treatment records and exams.  Diabetes mellitus, type II, is an enumerated condition under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Walker, 708 F.3d 1331.

However, the disability was not shown as chronic in service, did not manifest to a compensable degree within a presumptive period, and was not noted in service with attributable continuity of symptomatology.  In this case, the presumptive period is within one year of the Veteran's April 1989 end date for his second period of service.  Here, there is no diagnosis of diabetes mellitus prior to the expiration of the presumptive period in April 1990.  An April 11, 1989, service treatment record shows a blood glucose of 111.  Later laboratory results note that 105 is the high end of the normal range.  Nevertheless, this elevated glucose finding is not accompanied by a diabetes diagnosis.  Likewise, during this period, there is no evidence that any such disability had manifested to a compensable degree within that time frame.  A compensable degree of diabetes mellitus would be evidence of diabetes mellitus controlled by a restrictive diet.  As such, presumptive service connection is not warranted.

Service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, however, may still be granted on a direct basis.  The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

Here, the evidence against the claim includes the January 2021 addendum report, which found that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II, was not at least as likely as not related to his active-duty military service because there was no diagnosis of diabetes during service or evidence upon which such a diagnosis could be made.

The evidence in favor of the claim includes the September 2020 medical opinion found that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II, was at least as likely as not related to his continuously elevated glucose during service.  The implication being that the Veteran's elevated glucose noted in April 1989 eventually progressed to diabetes.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current diabetes mellitus, type II, is related to service. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Additionally, service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  The record shows diagnoses of bilateral upper and lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy, as well as proliferative diabetic retinopathy including left eye laser treatment.  As diabetic peripheral neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy are known complications of diabetes mellitus, type II, service connection is also warranted for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities and proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

6. Service connection for varicose veins

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the October 2022 rating decision on appeal found a current diagnosis of varicose veins and in-service treatment for varicose veins in 1997.  However, this rating decision did note that the in-service treatment for varicose veins occurred during a period that the Veteran's service was characterized as "other than honorable."  This is clear and unmistakable evidence against the favorable finding that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service; therefore, the in-service onset, incurrence, or injury element is not satisfied.  Nevertheless, there is no evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding of a current disability and so the current disability element is satisfied.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a diagnosis of varicose veins, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that it began during active service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  

The October 2020 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's varicose veins are at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease; however, the opinion is not probative because it is based, at least in part, on the diagnosis of varicose veins in the Veteran's February 1997 separation exam.  As noted above, the character of the Veteran's discharge from his third period of service is a statutory bar to benefits incurred during that period (April 1989-March 1997).  Thus, a positive opinion linking the Veteran's current disability to his state of health recorded in the February 1997 separation examination is not probative here.

The September 2020 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's varicose veins were first diagnosed in 1997, during his ineligible period of service, and as this condition occurred during a period of service which was determined to be other than honorable, creating a statutory bar to benefits, there is no basis for service connection for varicose veins. 

The Board notes that at the time of his October 2020 examination, the Veteran reported an in-service onset of varicose veins in 1984.  Varicose veins are lay-observable and, therefore, the Veteran is competent to provide lay evidence of their onset.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2).  In this case, however, the Board finds such evidence not credible due to internal inconsistency and inconsistency with other evidence in the record.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  In his May 2020 claim, the Veteran associated his varicose veins with standing during his military service, but did not offer an onset date.  This is inconsistent with the contemporaneous medical record as there was no mention of this condition in 1984, his March 1985 report of medical history or exam, or at any time in the service treatment records until the February 1997 separation examination that noted multiple moderate varicosities in the bilateral lower extremities below the knees.  Notably, this examination was three years after he deserted.  Moreover, the 1984 onset date was only offered after the Veteran had received a negative opinion on this matter, citing the lack of varicose veins during an eligible period of service.  Thus, the Board finds the assertion that the Veteran's varicose veins began in 1984 to be not credible.

While the Veteran believes the claimed varicose veins is related to his military service, the Board reiterates that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against findings that this disability began during an eligible period of service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease during such a period.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for varicose veins is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

7. Service connection for a low back disability

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the October 2022 rating decision on appeal found a current diagnosis of degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS).  There is no evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in this favorable finding and so the current disability element is satisfied.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a diagnosis of IVDS, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that it began during active service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the Veteran reported recurring back pain in August 1990 and June 1991.  An October 2000 VA treatment record notes lower back pain for ten years, which corresponds to an onset of roughly August 1990.  Thus, the medical evidence of record links the Veteran's current back problems to the August 1990 complaint, more than a year after his separation from his last eligible period of active duty.  As explain above, service connection cannot be established based on onset, service incurrence, or aggravation of a disease or injury during this period due to his separation "under other than honorable conditions."  Therefore, the August 1990 complaint cannot form the underlying basis for an award of service connection.

Turning to his eligible periods of service, the Veteran has not provided competent and credible evidence of an in-service injury, event, or disease.  In his May 2020 claim, the Veteran associated his herniated discs with working in the field.  No date or other specific details were provided.  At the time of his October 2020 VA examination, the Veteran reported low back pain after a strain in basic training that did not get better with ibuprofen and continued on an intermittent basis ever since.  This injury is not corroborated by the evidence as there was no mention of this injury in the contemporaneous medical record.  Instead, the Veteran specifically denied recurrent back pain in his March 1985 and April 1989 reports of medical history and no spinal abnormality was noted on his accompanying examinations.  His first documented low back complaints are during his third ineligible period of service in August 1990 and June 1991.  Moreover, when he first sought VA treatment for back pain, he reported a history of low back pain dating back ten years, which was 1990.  Only after the September 2020 VA examiner issued a negative opinion did the Veteran report a much earlier undocumented low back injury during basic training.  Thus, the Board finds no competent and credible evidence of an in-service injury, event, or disease.  

This is reflected in the September 2020 VA examiner's opinion that since the Veteran's low back pain was first diagnosed and treated in 1990, during a period of service which was determined to be other than honorable, creating a statutory bar to benefits, there is no basis for service connection for a low back disability.  By contrast, the October 2020 positive opinion is based in part of chronic low back pain documented in the Veteran's service treatment records.  This opinion does not identify specific service treatment records noting chronic low back pain and the Board only finds records related to low back pain from the Veteran's ineligible third period of service, this positive opinion has no probative value.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for a low back disability is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Id. 

The record shows that the Veteran has not worked during this appeals period.

Prior to this Board decision, the Veteran was service-connected for bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, onychocryptosis, and right great toe scars for a combined rating of no more than 20 percent. As such, he did not meet the schedular requirement for TDIU.  The grant of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II, diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper extremities, diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy above will likely increase his total schedular rating.  

Moreover, in this case, the Veteran's diabetes and neuropathy are among the disabilities listed in the Social Security Administration's decision that found him disabled, which indicates that these disabilities contribute to his unemployability.  

If the Veteran does not meet the percentage standards set forth in § 4.16(a), the Board may not consider the claim for a TDIU in the first instance but will refer it to the Director, Compensation Service, if there is "sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a veteran is unemployable by reason of his or her service-connected disabilities." See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019).  Thus, the Board cannot address the issue of TDIU until either the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) assigns disability ratings for diabetes mellitus type II, diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper extremities, diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy that meet the schedular requirements of TDIU or VA's Director, Compensation Service renders a finding on extraschedular TDIU.

?

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

If after effectuating the grants of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II, diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper extremities, diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy granted above, the Veteran continues to not meet the percentage standards set forth in § 4.16(a), refer the Veteran's claim seeking entitlement to a TDIU to VA's Director, Compensation Service, for extraschedular consideration.
