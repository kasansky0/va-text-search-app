ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is approximately balanced as to whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was caused by his service-connected other trauma and stressor related disorder with paranoid personality disorder by way of obesity that served as an intermediary factor.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

Veteran served on active duty from January 1989 to August 1990.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

 In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Service connection is also warranted for disability proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, to include medications taken therefor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Such secondary service connection is warranted for any increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b).

Obesity cannot be recognized as a disability, but it can be recognized as an intermediate step between a service-connected disability and a disability claimed as secondary to that service-connected disability, based on the service-connected disability causing or aggravating the obesity. See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 306-07 (2020).

In such a case, that evidence must reflect: (1) a service-connected disability or disabilities that caused the Veteran to become obese; (2) the obesity was a substantial factor in causing another disability; and (3) the disability would not have occurred but for the obesity caused by the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities. VAOGCPREC 1-2017.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to other trauma and stressor-related disorder with paranoid personality disorder.

The Veteran contends that the claimed obstructive sleep apnea is secondary to his service-connected other trauma and stressor related disorder with paranoid personality disorder by way of obesity that served as an intermediary factor between the two. See January 2023 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. Specifically, he states that "Due to [his] mental health condition and fatigue, [he] has also been less motivated to exercise which has also caused [his] weight gain."

The Veteran is currently diagnosed with an obstructive sleep apnea disability. See April 2023 VA Examination Report. The Veteran is currently service connected for other trauma and stressor related disorder with paranoid personality disorder. See January 2022 Rating Decision.

The key inquiry is whether the Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder caused obesity that ultimately resulted in his current obstructive sleep apnea.

To that end, the Veteran submitted a February 3, 2023, positive nexus opinion from Dr. M.B., who opined that "(i)t is at least as likely as not (a 50%/50% probability) that the Veteran's Obstructive Sleep Apnea with CPAP is secondary to, related to, and/or aggravated by the weight gain from the service-connected Other Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorder with Paranoid Personality [and] it is at least as likely as not (a50%/50% probability) that without the veteran's weight gain his Obstructive Sleep Apnea with CPAP would not have occurred." As rationale, Dr. M.B. noted medical literature including a work by Babson et al which reported that obesity is one of the leading risk-factors for OSA and obesity is associated with mood, anxiety and somatoform disorders as well as elevations in psychological distress. The private practitioner also noted the 40-pound weight-gain of the Veteran since service and the extensive medical records to draw his conclusion.

The Board finds the positive opinion the highly probative as it includes a clear conclusion based on the clinicians' extensive review of the Veteran's clinical history with supporting data from several medical studies and well-reasoned medical explanations. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

Regarding the September 2023 VA opinion, the VA examiner opined that "(t)he claimed condition is less likely than not [or] proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected condition."  The opinion fails to fully address the Veteran's main theory of entitlement involving his obesity as an intermediate step between his service-connected major depressive disorder and obstructive sleep apnea. It also fails to adequately discuss the private opinion and its conclusions. Therefore, minimal probative weight is assigned to this opinion.

Accordingly, as the February 2023 private opinion is the most probative evidence of record and relates the claimed obstructive sleep apnea to the Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder by way of obesity, the Board resolves all reasonable doubts in the Veteran's favor and grants service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The appeal is granted.
