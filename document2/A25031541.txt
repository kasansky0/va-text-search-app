DOCKET NO. 220117-211859
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include major depressive disorder, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively supports finding the Veteran's currently diagnosed major depressive disorder is proximately due to or aggravated by her service-connected residuals of mammoplasty disability. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for major depressive disorder, as secondary to the service-connected residuals of mammoplasty, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 2003 to September 2004. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2021 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In October 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2019 supplemental claim rating decision. In November 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2019 decision and denied service connection for major depressive disorder.

In the January 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2019 AOJ decision on appeal, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability.

The Veteran asserts she has a major depressive disorder as a result of her service-connected residuals of mammoplasty disability.

To establish service connection on a secondary basis, the evidence must show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310, Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When a veteran seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the veteran prevails. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In the November 2021 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable finding that the Veteran has a current disability, major depressive disorder. In the April 2019 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable finding that the Veteran is service connected for the primary disability, residuals of mammoplasty. The Board is bound by these favorable findings.

Therefore, the remaining question before the Board is whether the Veteran's service-connected residuals of mammoplasty disability caused or aggravated the major depressive disorder.

The Veteran was provided a VA examination in February 2019. The examiner diagnosed recurrent major depressive disorder and opined it was less likely than not directly related to active service. The examiner noted the Veteran attributed depressive symptoms to having scars from her breast surgery, but did not opine whether the Veteran's breast reduction surgery caused or aggravated the major depressive disorder. 

In February 2022, the Veteran submitted a non-VA medical opinion. The examiner, a psychologist, opined it is at least as likely not the Veteran's major depressive disorder is due to, the result of, or secondary to the Veteran's service-connected breast surgery and scarring. The Board finds the examiner's opinion highly probative.

The examination report shows the examiner reviewed the Veteran's entire claims file, including the February 2019 VA examiner's opinion, the Veteran's lay statements, and interviewed the Veteran. The examiner found the Veteran's treatment records and reports consistently document depression related to the service-connected residuals of mammoplasty disability and its resulting pain and functional limitations. The examiner included additional research regarding mental depressive disorder and treatment. The examiner concluded the trajectory of the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms resulted in a clear nexus between the service-connected residuals of mammoplasty disability and depression.

There is no contrary opinion of record.  

Accordingly, the Board finds the weight of the evidence favors finding the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability, to include major depressive disorder, is secondary to the Veteran's service-connected residuals of mammoplasty. Accordingly, service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include major depressive disorder is warranted, and the appeal is granted.
