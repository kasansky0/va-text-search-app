REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from December 1972 to December 1977.

The matter is on appeal from an October 2020 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) decision that denied entitlement to clothing allowances for 2020.

In an October 2020 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected a Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (b)(1). Accordingly, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the VHA decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

2. Entitlement to a clothing allowance for the year 2020 for a left knee brace

3. Entitlement to a clothing allowance for the year 2020 for a right knee brace

The law provides for payment of an annual clothing allowance for each veteran who, because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, such as a wheelchair, which VA determines tends to wear out or tear the clothing, or uses prescribed medication for a service-connected skin disability which causes irreparable damage to the outer garments. 38 U.S.C. § 1162.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.810, a veteran is found to be eligible for an annual clothing allowance when (i) A VA examination or VA medical report establishes that the veteran, because of a service-connected disability due to loss or loss of use of a hand or foot uses a qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance which tends to wear or tear clothing; (ii) The Under Secretary for Health or a designee certifies that a veteran, because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance which tends to wear or tear clothing; or (iii) The Under Secretary for Health or a designee certifies that a veteran, because of a service-connected disability, uses medication prescribed by a physician for a skin condition that causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outergarments. 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1). When such determinations are appealed to the Board, the Board can serve as the VHA designee to adjudicate whether a clothing allowance is warranted.

A second clothing allowance is available for a single type of garment if a veteran uses more than one prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, medication for more than one skin condition, or an appliance and a medication, and the appliances or medications (i) satisfy the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1); and (ii) together tend to wear or tear a single garment or irreparably damage a type of outergarment at an increased rate of damage to the clothing due to a second appliance or medication. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(3).

An additional clothing allowance is available for each prosthetic, orthopedic appliance, or medication used by a veteran if it (i) satisfies the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1); and (ii) affects a distinct type of article of clothing or outergarment. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(2).

The Veteran contends that his back brace and bilateral knee braces causes yearly wear and tear of his clothing. He is seeking entitlement to an annual VA clothing allowance for the year 2020.

The Board observes that the Veteran is service connected for arthritis of the lumbar spine and arthritis of the bilateral knees. Evidence of record further demonstrates that VA has issued him two Otto Bock knee braces and lumbar sacral orthosis (LSO) sagittal control (SAG) brace in connection with his service-connected disabilities. 

Therefore, the dispositive issue before the Board is whether the Veteran's back brace and bilateral knee braces tends to wear or tear his clothing.

In the October 2020 VHA decision, the Veteran was denied a clothing allowance for the back brace and knee braces because the "prosthetic appliance does not cause wear or tear to the outergarment."

Upon review of the available evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence supports the award of a clothing allowance for the year 2020 for the Veteran's use of a back brace and knee braces. The Veteran is competent to report that the back brace and knee braces causes irreparable damage to his clothing, inasmuch as such effect is readily observable by a lay person. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). By virtue of filing the claim for the 2020 clothing allowance, the Veteran has essentially reported that the back brace and knee braces does damage his clothing. 

The Board additionally notes that the Veteran has received annual clothing allowance payment for the back brace and bilateral knee braces in the prior years. See e.g. 2018 Statement of the Case. There is no indication that the type/brand of back brace or knee braces changed during that year.

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds it likely that regular use of a VA-prescribed back brace and bilateral knee braces tended to wear or tear the Veteran's outer garments during the 2020 calendar year. Accordingly, a clothing allowance for the year 2020 for a back brace and bilateral knee braces are granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a clothing allowance for the year 2020 for a wheelchair is remanded.

2. Entitlement to a clothing allowance for the year 2020 for a left ankle brace is remanded.

3. Entitlement to a clothing allowance for the year 2020 for a right ankle brace is remanded.

Regarding the Veteran's claims for clothing allowances for the 2020 calendar year, the AOJ denied those claims, only stating, "Not entitled, prosthetic appliance does not cause wear or tear to the outer garment."

In the instant case, the Board finds that remand for the Veteran's claims for clothing allowances for the 2020 calendar year due to use of right and left ankle braces and a wheelchair are warranted in order to satisfy a statutory duty under 38 U.S.C. § 5104. See 38 C.F.R. §20.802(a). In this regard, the Board points out that, generally, a claimant is entitled to notice of a decision by the Secretary that includes an explanation of the procedure for obtaining review of the decision. 38 U.S.C. § 5104(a). Such notice must also include the following:

1. Identification of the issues adjudicated.

2. A summary of the evidence considered by the Secretary.

3. A summary of the applicable laws and regulations.

4. Identification of findings favorable to the claimant.

5. In the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial.

6. An explanation of how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision.

7. If applicable, identification of the criteria that must be satisfied to grant service connection or the next higher level of compensation.

38 U.S.C. § 5104(b).

Unfortunately, the October 2020 VHA denial does not provide notice as described in 38 U.S.C. § 5104. Specifically, the October 2020 denial letter does not provide a summary of the evidence considered, identify any favorable findings, or explain how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision. In this regard, the Board points out that, at the time of the decision on appeal, the Veteran was service connected for arthritis of the lumbar spine, arthritis of multiple joints, and radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities. 

The AOJ's decision, however, contains no discussion of whether the Veteran's ankle braces and/or wheelchair were worn or used for a service-connected disability, to include any favorable finding in this regard. Further, it is not clear from the evidence reviewable by the Board that the Veteran's ankle braces and wheelchair were prescribed for a service-connected disability. Additionally, although the denial letter seemingly identified the bases for the denials, the Board points out that governing statute does not limit the payment of allowances to only those braces with rigid support and/or to wheelchairs with positioning and posturing adaptions, sliding boards and seat transfers functionalities, and without clothing guards.

Without adequate notice of the basis for the denial, a claimant cannot make an informed decision as to whether or not to accept or appeal the decision nor can he or she know what evidence to submit in order to substantiate the appeal. See Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 252 (2007). The Veteran was not put on notice of what additional evidence or argument could be presented to support an appeal of the AOJ decision and such must be corrected on remand. See 38 C.F.R. §20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Issue the Veteran a notice of decision on the issues of entitlement to a clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year due to use of right and left ankle braces and a wheelchair, as described in 38U.S.C. §5104(b). 

The notice shall include, but is not limited to: a summary of the evidence; a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; identification of findings favorable to the claimant; and identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial. The AOJ must make a definitive determination as to whether or not the Veteran's ankle braces and wheelchair are worn or used for a service-connected disability.

Regarding identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial, the AOJ must provide a clear analysis for each item for which the AOJ determines a clothing allowance is not payable, paying attention to the fact that the governing statute does not limit the payment of allowances to only those braces with rigid support and/or to wheelchairs with positioning and posturing adaptions, sliding boards and seat transfers functionalities, and without clothing guards.
