ORDER

A waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits in the amount of $6,308.81 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The overpayment at issue was not created due to the Veteran's fraud, misrepresentation or bad faith.

2. The creation of the debt at issue was due solely to error and delay on the part of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), and was not the fault of the Veteran.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Recovery of the overpayment of VA compensation benefits in the amount of $6,308.81 would be against equity and good conscience. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5302(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.963(a), 1.965(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the Unites States Army from June 1976 to December 1982.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeal from a January 2024 decision of the VA Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). The Veteran submitted a VA Form 101082, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in April 2024 and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 COWC decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after January 2024 cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Under pertinent VA laws and regulations, any individual who is entitled to compensation or to dependency and indemnity compensation and who is incarcerated in a Federal, State, local, or other penal institution or correctional facility for a period in excess of 60 days for conviction of a felony (where, as here, committed after October 7, 1980) shall not be paid such compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation, for the period beginning on the 61st day of such incarceration and ending on the day such incarceration ends, in an amount that exceeds (A) in the case of a veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 20 percent or more, the rate of compensation payable under section 1114(a) of this title; or (B) in the case of a veteran with a service-connected disability not rated at 20 percent or more or in the case of a surviving spouse, parent, or child, one-half of the rate of compensation payable under section 1114(a) of this title. 38 U.S.C. § 5313(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.665(a). 

In June 2019, the AOJ added a printout from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to the claims file. This document showed that the Veteran was actively incarcerated at this time and had been since 1997. The claims file shows the AOJ immediately began communicating with the Veteran at his address in prison, as is seen in a July 2019 letter to the Veteran related to a VA compensation claim. August 2019 and September 2019 internal documents show the AOJ was having trouble scheduling VA examinations due to the Veteran's incarceration. In May 2022, when attempting to order diagnostic testing for the purpose of VA opinions, communication was made with the prison and a memorandum was added to the claims file with the subject line "Attempt to Schedule and Exam for a Veteran who is incarcerated." The AOJ undoubtedly was aware the Veteran was incarcerated.

In September 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision awarding a compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected back disability and associated lower extremity radiculopathy. A 30 percent rating was assigned effective April 23, 2022. The September 2022 notification letter was sent to the Veteran in prison and it notified him of his VA compensation award without any mention of an incarceration adjustment.

In October 2022, the Veteran wrote to the AOJ noting that he is in prison. In December 2022, the Veteran again wrote to the AOJ and pointed out that he should only be receiving VA compensation payments at the 10 percent rate.

In January 2023, the AOJ wrote to the Veteran notifying him it had received information from the Bureau of Prisons indicating he is incarcerated. This letter is suggesting VA was not already aware of this fact, which it clearly was. The AOJ proposed to reduce the Veteran's VA compensation to 10 percent due to his incarceration and informed him that he had 60 days to respond with any reason the reduction in his monthly award should not take place. Less than one week later in January 2023, the Veteran again wrote to the AOJ and indicated it was erroneously paying him benefits at the 30 percent rate when he should be receiving benefits at the 10 percent rate. He again wrote to the AOJ in February 2023, April 2023 and August 2023 and repeatedly asked for his benefits to be reduced to the 10 percent rate. It was not until November 2023 that the AOJ wrote to the Veteran and informed him that final action was being taken to retroactively reduce his VA compensation benefits to 10 percent. This change was made retroactive to May 1, 2022, which was the first date of payment after the award with the effective date of April 23, 2022. In December 2023, the VA Debt Management Center (DMC) notified the Veteran of the $6,308.81 overpayment that was created following this retroactive adjustment to his benefits. In January 2024, the COWC decision was issued and this appeal followed.

In the decision on appeal, COWC did not find fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith in this case. The Board will not disturb this favorable finding.  

In cases where fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the Veteran's part with respect to the creation of the overpayment at issue has not been demonstrated, and, therefore, waiver is not precluded pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a), the Board must determine whether recovery of the indebtedness would be against equity and good conscience, thereby permitting waiver under 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a) and 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.963(a), 1.965(a). In making this determination, consideration is given to the following elements, which are not intended to be all-inclusive: (1) fault of debtor (where actions of the debtors contribute to the creation of the debt); (2) balancing of faults (weighing fault of the debtor vs. the fault of VA); (3) undue hardship (whether collection would deprive the debtor or family of basic necessities); (4) defeat the purpose (whether withholding of benefits or recovery would nullify the objective for which benefits were intended); (5) unjust enrichment (failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the debtor); and (6) changing position to one's detriment (reliance on VA benefits results in relinquishment of a valuable right or incurrence of a legal obligation). See 38 C.F.R. § 1.965(a). 

The first and second elements pertain to the fault of the debtor versus the fault of VA. In this case, VA is entirely at fault. As discussed above, the Veteran's incarceration was clearly known to the AOJ long before the September 2022 award of VA compensation that led to this overpayment. The AOJ communicated with the prison when attempting to obtain diagnostic testing related to the claims and the AOJ communicated with the Veteran at his prison address. Moreover, after the AOJ first communicated with the Veteran about his incarceration, he wrote in several times asking for his benefits to be reduced. The AOJ inexplicably sent the Veteran his full award and began paying his benefits at the full rate despite knowing that the Veteran is incarcerated. This was VA's error. The Veteran made several attempts to have VA take action to correct the error and the AOJ delayed many months in responding. The Veteran is not at fault in the creation of this debt and the debt was created solely due to VA's error and VA's delay.

In regard to whether failure to collect would cause unjust enrichment to the debtor, the Board notes that the Veteran received benefits to which he was not entitled and as such, keeping these benefits would cause unjust enrichment to the debtor. Likewise, there is no indication that the Veteran's reliance on VA benefits resulted in relinquishment of another valuable right. As to whether recoupment of those benefits would defeat the purpose of the benefit, recoupment of those benefits would not defeat the purpose of the benefit since the Veteran was not entitled to the full benefits during his incarceration. The Board has also considered whether the Veteran would suffer undue financial hardship if forced to repay the debt at issue. Because the Veteran is incarcerated and is being provided basic needs for living by the prison facility, the Board finds that hardship is not a factor in this analysis. 

On the whole the Board finds that, in weighing all of the elements of equity and good conscience, the fact that this debt was caused solely by VA error and VA delay outweighs the elements that are not in his favor. Accordingly, waiver of recovery of the $6,308.81 overpayment is warranted. The appeal is granted.
