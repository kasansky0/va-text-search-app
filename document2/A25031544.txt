ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right wrist eczema is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's right wrist eczema does not result in characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial compensable rating for right wrist eczema have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7806.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2002 to January 2015. 

The Veteran filed an intent to file in January 2023, and an original disability claim, in February 2023, which was granted by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in a June 2023 rating decision. 

In February 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, higher level review (HLR) appeal, and in May 2024, the AOJ granted an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by application of the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; see generally 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating. Otherwise, the lower rating applies. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability determinations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Where, as here, the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). When the factual findings show distinct time periods during which the Veteran exhibited symptoms of disability and such symptoms warrant different disability ratings, staged ratings may be assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 780-81 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right wrist eczema.

The Veteran contends that his right wrist eczema is worse than contemplated by his currently assigned disability rating. Specifically, the Veteran contends that he exposed to fuel during service and since has had breakouts on his chest, arms and stomach, which causes unwanted attention from others to the affected areas. See November 2023 HLR - Informal Conference. 

The Veteran's right wrist eczema has been rated as noncompensable throughout the period on appeal, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7806. 

A General Rating Formula for the Skin applies to Diagnostic Codes 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Under this formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned where there is no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.

A 10 percent rating requires at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

A 30 percent rating requires at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.

A 60 percent rating requires at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body, or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy required over the past 12-month period.

The 10, 30, and 60 percent criteria list examples of types of systemic therapy as including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs.

Alternatively, the rating criteria states to rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck under Diagnostic Code 7800, or as scars under Diagnostic Codes 7801 through 7805, depending upon the predominant disability.

The Veteran's effective date for service connection is August 10, 2022, therefore, a review of the evidence is from August 10, 2022, onwards. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). 

Turning to the relevant medical evidence of record, in February 2021 and November 2022, the Veteran was noted to have an intermitted rash on his hand, which was likely eczema. See March 2023 CAPRI. 

In May 2023, the Veteran was afforded an in-person VA examination, where his records were reviewed, including his VA e-folder. The Veteran was diagnosed with right wrist eczema with a date of onset of May 2023, and chronic urticaria with a date of onset of 2015. The Veteran reported that he started to have skin conditions when he was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan in 2009 and 2012, respectively. The examiner noted that the Veteran had not been treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications in the past 12 months for any skin condition. The examiner noted that the Veteran had been treated with Clindamycin, a 1 % topical gel medication, used once daily after shower, or constant or near constant, in the past 12 months for the Veteran's eczema skin condition. The examiner also noted that the Veteran had not had any treatments or procedures in the past 12 months for any skin condition. The total body area and exposed areas affected by the Veteran's right wrist eczema was found to be less than five percent, and none, respectively. See May 2023 C&P Exam. 

In September 2023, the Veteran was again noted by a VA medical provider to have a diagnosis of eczema and dermatitis. See September 2023 CAPRI. 

Based on a careful review of all the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board finds that during the period on appeal, the Veteran's right wrist eczema does not warrant an initial compensable rating under the General Rating Formula for the Skin.

The evidence reflects that the Veteran's right wrist eczema does not manifest characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or requires intermittent systemic therapy required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period. Accordingly, the Board finds that there is no basis upon which to award a compensable rating under the General Rating Formula for the Skin.

The Board has also considered if a higher rating would be warranted under Diagnostic Code 7800. A rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 7800 as burn scars or scars of the head, face or neck or disfigurement of the head, face or neck have not been shown. 

Additionally, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's sincere belief that his skin condition is more severe than reflected by his currently assigned rating. The Veteran is competent to report the features or symptoms of his disability. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994). However, he is not competent to state that his skin disability is of sufficient severity to warrant a higher rating under the rating schedule, as such an opinion requires specialized medical expertise which falls outside the realm of the common knowledge of a layperson. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). While the Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements and has given them appropriate weight where they are consistent with the objective medical evidence of record, the Board has accorded greater probative weight to the objective medical evidence as the VA examiner has the requisite medical training and expertise to evaluate the Veteran's disability.

Further, the Board acknowledges that the May 2023 VA medical examiner noted that the Veteran has, "more than one skin condition" with a combined total body area of 5% to < 20%, however, the Veteran is already service connected for his urticaria from July 18, 2017, at a 10 percent disability rating, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7825. Assigning a separate disability rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7806, for the same symptoms already rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7825, would constitute pyramiding, which is forbidden. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994).

Lastly, neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the increased rating claim adjudicated herein. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the assignment of an initial compensable rating for right wrist eczema, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable to this claim. Accordingly, the appeal for a compensable rating for right wrist eczema must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 780-81.
