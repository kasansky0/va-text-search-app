ORDER

Entitlement to a total evaluation based upon individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) for the period from July 29, 2020, to May 14, 2021, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to May 14, 2021, the Veteran met the schedular criteria for TDIU, and his service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for TDIU for the period from July 29, 2020, to May 14, 2021, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2015 to July 2020.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 higher-level review decision of an August 2023 rating decision issue.

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA 10182 and elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision.  If evidence was submitted during the time period after the AOJ issued that decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  Nevertheless, the Board is granting the benefit sought in full in the decision below.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Law and Analysis

The Veteran and his representative have not raised any issues with the pre-decisional duty to notify or duty to assist with regard to the issue decided herein.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

All veterans who are shown to be unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disability shall be rated totally disabled.  For VA purposes, total disability exists when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 4.16(b).

A total disability rating for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when a veteran is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Nevertheless, even when the percentage requirements are not met, entitlement to TDIU on an extraschedular basis may be granted in exceptional cases when the veteran is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

Entitlement to a total rating must be based solely on the impact of service-connected disabilities on the ability to keep and maintain substantially gainful employment.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  The central inquiry is "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability."  Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).  For VA purposes, the term "unemployability" is synonymous with inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation.  VAOPGPREC 75-91, 57 Fed. Reg. 2317 (Jan. 21, 1992).

Consideration may be given to the veteran's education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his or her age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; see also Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).  A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment, but the ultimate question is whether a veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment.  Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. at 363.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to TDIU for the period from July 29, 2020, to May 14, 2021.

The Veteran is currently assigned a 100 percent evaluation effective from May 14, 2021.  However, his representative has specifically indicated that they are appealing the issue of entitlement to TDIU for the period from July 29, 2020 (the day following his separation from service) to May 14, 2021. See November VA Form 20-0996; April 2024 VA Form 10182.

Prior to May 14, 2021, the Veteran was service-connected for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with alcohol use disorder (70 percent disabling since July 29, 2020); obstructive sleep apnea (50 percent disabling since July 29, 2020); bilateral flat foot with plantar fasciitis (30 percent disabling since July 29, 2020);  tinnitus (10 percent disabling since July 29, 2020); a lumbosacral strain (10 percent disabling since February 7, 2021); gastroesophageal reflux disease (noncompensable from July 29, 2020, to February 17, 2021); and tension headaches (noncompensable from July 29, 2020).  His combined evaluation was 90 percent.  Thus, the Veteran met the schedular criteria for TDIU during this time period.

The evidence also shows that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure and to follow substantially gainful employment from July 29, 2020, to May 14, 2021.

In a November 2022 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran noted that he had completed eleventh grade and indicated that he had worked full-time in a warehouse from July 29, 2022, to August 1, 2022, yet he indicated that he worked 40 hours per week and that his highest earnings gross earnings per month at that job was $3,200.  He did not report any other work since his military service.  The Veteran claimed that all of his service-connected disabilities prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful employment. 

VA treatment records dated in February 2021 show that the Veteran had recently quit a job after one day because he did not know that he would have to drive and felt anxious in the truck with his trainer.  He did not feel that he could do the work.  The Veteran had also reported in February 2021 that he had been struggling with jobs since being out of service for six months.  It was noted that he was trained and experienced as a truck driver, but his PTSD from being hit with a mortar while deployed kept him from taking good truck driving jobs.  In March 2021, the Veteran indicated that he had not been able to keep a job due to his anxiety, noting that he quit his last one after two days because he could not drive.  It was further noted in April 2021 that he knew he needed a job, but he did not feel motivated to get one.  The Veteran later indicated in May 2021 that he had to quit job in warehouse because of neck and back problems; he has been granted service connection for a lumbosacral strain since February 7, 2021, but not for a neck disorder.  In addition, he stated that he had quit school in May 2021.  The Veteran also reported that month that he has pain in his feet with prolonged standing, which had caused him to quit a job in a warehouse.

An August 2020 VA PTSD examiner noted that the Veteran had completed high school and was unemployed, but seeking employment.  The examiner found that his symptoms included disturbances of motivation and mood and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting, and concluded that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

September 2020 VA examiners found that the Veteran's service-connected sleep apnea and tinnitus did not impact his ability to work.  A September 2020 VA intestinal conditions examiner did indicate that diarrhea impacted his ability to work, as cramping, pain, and excessive time on the toilet interrupts work and reduces overall productivity.  However, the Veteran was not granted service connection for irritable bowel syndrome until May 14, 2021.  Nevertheless, a September 2020 VA back examiner found that his service-connected lumbosacral strain impacted his ability to work, as he had difficulty with carrying heavy items or prolonged forward flexion.  A September 2020 VA foot examiner also stated that the Veteran's service-connected pes planus impacted his ability to work, as he had difficulty with prolonged walking or long days on his feet.  In addition, another September 2020 VA examiner indicated that his service-connected headaches interfered with executive function and reduced tolerance for long workdays.

In addition, a January 2021 letter indicates that further action on his claim for the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) program was discontinued due to his lack of cooperation or failure to participate.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that there is at least a reasonable doubt that the Veteran was unable to obtain or to maintain substantially gainful employment, consistent with his education level and occupational background, due to the combined impact of his service-connected disabilities during this time period.  The Veteran had physical limitations as a result of some of his service-connected disabilities, as noted by the September 2020 VA examiners, and his service-connected PTSD caused other limitations, including anxiety with driving and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including a work setting.  In addition, his service-connected headaches interfered with his executive function and reduced his tolerance for long workdays.  Thus, resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the cumulative evidence of record shows that the collective impact of his service-connected disabilities would have made it difficult to maintain such employment during the time period on appeal.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that TDIU is warranted for the period from July 29, 2020, to May 14, 2021.
