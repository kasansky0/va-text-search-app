ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea developed due to weight gain attributable to his service-connected musculoskeletal disabilities.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected musculoskeletal disabilities are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1980 to October 2000.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea 

The Veteran contends that decreased activity due to his service-connected musculoskeletal and associated disabilities caused him to decrease physical activity, which led to his weight gain, and ultimately, obstructive sleep apnea.

To establish service connection, a showing of competent medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence must confirm (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir 2004).  Where a disability is proximately due to or aggravated by an already service-connected disability service connection may be granted on a so-called secondary basis.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310; see Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc).

Here, the Veteran is diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea.  See September 7, 2021 C&P Examination.  And, he is currently service connected for degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy, left lower extremity femoral nerve radiculopathy, right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy, left knee degenerative arthritis, and right knee degenerative arthritis.   Of note, frequent trouble sleeping was noted in his retirement physical examination at separation from active-duty service.    See November  27, 2000 STR-Medical.  Three VA medical opinions were obtained in furtherance of the Veteran's claim.  Two other medical opinions in support of the Veteran's claim were associated with the record as well.    In the September 2020 medical opinion, the examiners opined that the Veteran's sleep apnea was unrelated to his service-connected disabilities because, in essence, it was most likely related to his diet, specifically large portions as noted in an April 2019 nutritional note.  But the examiner made no mention of the Veteran's documented sleep issues at exit from service in 2000.  Accordingly, the Board affords that opinion no probative weight.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007) (holding that a medical opinion is adequate where it is based on consideration of the veteran's prior medical history).    

The April 2020 negative nexus VA medical opinion was conclusory, thus the Board affords it no probative weight either.  

In the September 2021 VA medical opinion, the examiner acknowledged  that the Veteran was noted to have sleep issues in service and acknowledged the Veteran's contention that his sleep apnea symptoms began while in service before opining that the Veteran's sleep apnea was not caused by his service-connected  musculoskeletal disabilities.  The examiner did not provide an opinion regarding whether the Veteran's sleep apnea began while in active-duty service.  According to the examiner, diet and lifestyle have the most significant impact on weight gain, therefore, the Veteran's weight gain is not an intermediary step between his musculoskeletal disabilities and the development of sleep apnea.  However, sedentary lifestyle (due to an inability to engage in typical activities because of musculoskeletal disabilities), as contended by the Veteran, is a lifestyle consideration that the examiner did not address.  Accordingly, the Board affords that opinion no probative weight. 

Nonetheless, two private positive nexus medical opinions were associated with the record, and the Board affords them both significant probative weight.  After extensive review of the Veteran's record and the medical literature,  the examiners in both the May 2020 and March 2021 opinions determined that the Veteran's musculoskeletal disabilities led to a more sedentary lifestyle which , in turn, led to the Veteran's obesity.  In both opinions, the examiners associated obesity with the development of obstructive sleep apnea.  In the May 2020 opinion, the examiner indicated that obesity is associated with functional impairment and weakening of the upper airway muscles, and in the March 2021 opinion, the examiner indicated that NSAID use for chronic pain has the potential to cause respiratory depression which, at the very least, aggravated the Veteran's sleep apnea.  Accordingly, the Board grants service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.
