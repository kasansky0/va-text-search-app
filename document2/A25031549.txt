ORDER

Service connection for left shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The May 2024 rating decision by the Agency of Jurisdiction (AOJ) provided favorable findings that the Veteran has been diagnosed with left shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis, and a nexus or link has been established between the claimed issue and an in-service event or injury; the favorable findings by the AOJ in the May 2024 rating decision have not been rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for the Veteran's left shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.104, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2013 to September 2018.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the February 2024 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Timeliness of the Notice of Disagreement for lower back pain, right foot condition, and for migraine headaches

An appeal of a decision by the AOJ consists of a Notice of Disagreement submitted to the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.201. A claimant must file a properly completed VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) within one year from the date that the agency mails notice of the decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If a Notice of Disagreement is not filed within the one-year period, and the Veteran does not pursue another available administrative review option, then the decision becomes finally adjudicated. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d)(2), 20.1103. The filing of an incorrect VA form does not extend, toll, or otherwise delay the time limit for filing the correct form. 38 C.F.R. 20.202(e). Time limits within which a veteran is required to act to challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended for good cause shown. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).

a.) Timeliness of the appeal for service connection for lower back pain

The Veteran initially filed a claim for lower back pain in November 2018. The claim for lower back pain denied in a February 2019 rating decision by the AOJ, and notice was also sent in February 2019. The Veteran again filed a claim for a back condition in October 2021. The VA sent a letter to the Veteran notifying him that since the claim was previously denied, the VA 21-526EZ was the wrong form and that VA regulations require the Veteran to file this request on the proper form. As noted above, the filing of an incorrect VA form does not extend, toll, or otherwise delay the time limit for filing the correct form. 38 C.F.R. 20.202(e).

As this claim was denied in a February 2019 rating decision and no administrative review options were pursued by the Veteran within one year of this rating decision, the claim became finally adjudicated. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d)(2), 3.2500, 20.1103. 

In May 2024, more than one year after being sent notice of the February 2019 rating decision, the VA received the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement. The Veteran did not give a reason why his Notice of Disagreement was untimely, and he did not request an extension of the applicable time limit. The Board finds that there is no good cause shown to support extending the time for filing.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the February 2019 rating decision which denied the Veteran's claim for lower back pain is final. An appeal to this AOJ rating decision is not properly before Board because the procedural requirements have not been met, and no good cause for extension is shown. 

b.) Timeliness of the appeal for service connection for a right foot condition and for an increased initial rating for migraine headaches

The Veteran initially filed a claim for service connection for a right foot condition and for migraine headaches in October 2021. The claims were denied in a January 2022 rating decision by the AOJ.

The Veteran filed a request for higher-level review in February 2022. Service connection for a right foot condition was again denied in a June 2022 rating decision, but service connection for migraine headaches was granted with a noncompensable (0 percent) evaluation in a June 2022 rating decision. Notice of both decisions were sent in June 2022.

As this claim was denied in a June 2022 rating decision and no administrative review options were pursued by the Veteran within one year of this rating decision, the claim became finally adjudicated. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d)(2), 3.2500, 20.1103.

In May 2024, more than one year after being sent notice of the June 2022 rating decision, the VA received the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement. The Veteran did not give a reason why his Notice of Disagreement was untimely, and he did not request an extension of the applicable time limit. The Board finds that there is no good cause shown to support extending the time for filing.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the June 2022 rating decision which denied the Veteran's claim for a right foot condition and granted the Veteran's claim for migraine headaches with a noncompensable (0 percent) evaluation is final. An appeal to this AOJ rating decision is not properly before Board because the procedural requirements have not been met, and no good cause for extension is shown.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The May 2024 rating decision by the AOJ provided favorable findings that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a left shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis, other than post-traumatic, and that a nexus, or link, has been established between the Veteran's claimed issue and an in-service event or injury, as the July 2018 separation exam noted the Veteran's report of getting sharp pain in his left shoulder and neck when rotating his shoulder. The Board is bound by these favorable findings, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The Veteran attended a VA examination in December 2023. The VA examiner provided diagnoses of left shoulder strain and left shoulder degenerative arthritis, other than post-traumatic. 

The VA examiner also provided a medical opinion that the Veteran's left shoulder condition was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) incurred or caused by the claimed in-service injury, even, or illness. The examiner also provided a rationale that there is a lack of substantiating evidence supporting a nexus between the current diagnosis of left shoulder DJD and military service and without chronicity during service or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology.

However, a medical opinion that does not address the Veteran's lay statements is insufficient. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). As a result, the December 2023 medical opinion is assigned no probative value.

The Board notes that on the July 2018 report of medical history associated with the Veteran's military separation examination, the Veteran reported that "for a few weeks when I rotate my shoulder, I get a sharp pain in shoulder and neck (left shoulder)." In addition, the Veteran stated on his October 2023 claim form he was an aircraft mechanic, and picking up heavy items and using heavy tools daily caused wear and tear on his shoulder. 

Finally, during the December 2023 VA examination, the Veteran stated that he was stationed in Africa when he started having left shoulder pain and discomfort from carrying a heavy toolbox as a mechanic. He also indicated that he did seek medical attention and was given Motrin and his left shoulder has gotten worse over the years, further stating that he has been having increasing pain in the left shoulder. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the favorable findings provided by the AOJ in the May 2024 rating decision are not rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error. Therefore, the first, second, and third elements of service connection: evidence of a current disability, evidence of in-service incurrence of a left shoulder injury, and evidence of a nexus between the in-service injury and the present disability have been met. Accordingly, service connection for the Veteran's left shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis is warranted.

Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder strain with degenerative arthritis is granted.
