ORDER

Service connection for a lumbar spine disability, variously diagnosed as degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease, and spinal stenosis, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's lumbar spine disability was aggravated by his active service.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish service connection for a lumbar spine disability, variously diagnosed as degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease, and spinal stenosis, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.306.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty for training (ACDUTRA) from April 1983 to August 1983 and active service from December 1990 to May 1991.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2023 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction that determined that new and relevant evidence had not been received to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability.  

The Veteran requested higher level review in May 2023, and the AOJ issued a responsive rating decision in July 2023.  

The Veteran submitted VA Form 10182 in February 2024, electing the direct Board review option.  The Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 rating decision.

The Board observes that if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim.  Service department records include records that are related to a claimed in-service event, injury, or disease, regardless of whether they mention the veteran by name.  See 38 C.F.R. §3.156(c)(1)(i).  Here, the Veteran submitted relevant service records in support of his January 2023 supplemental claim application, VA Form 20-0995.  Specifically, he submitted a copy of DA Form 2173, Statement of Medical Examination and Duty Status dated in May 1991, showing his complaint of back pain while on active duty.  This document was not previously associated with the claims file or considered by the AOJ; thus, reconsideration of the Veteran's claim is warranted.  

The Veteran seeks service connection for a back disability.  He has current diagnoses including degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease, and spinal stenosis.  See February 2023 VA examination report.  As noted, the record documents complaints of back pain during active service in May 1991.  The record also establishes that the Veteran sought care for back complaints in the years following his period of active service.  See August 1994 private medical report; see also May 1997 NGR Form 40-501 Annual Medical Certificate.  

Entitlement to VA compensation may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active duty.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 (wartime service), 1131 (peacetime service); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"-the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Board notes that every Veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted and enrolled for service, except as to defects noted at the time of the examination, acceptance and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence or medical judgment is such as to warrant a finding that the disease or injury existed before acceptance and enrollment, and was not aggravated by such service.  38 U.S.C. § 1111.

The statutory language regarding the presumption of soundness indicates that the presumption applies when a Veteran has been "examined, accepted, and enrolled for service," and where that examination revealed no "defects, infirmities, or disorders."  38 U.S.C. § 1111.  Thus, the statute requires that there be an examination prior to entry into the period of service on which the claim is based.  See Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 45 (2010).  In the absence of such an examination, there is no basis from which to determine whether the claimant was in sound condition upon entry into that period of service on which the claim is based.  See Smith, 24 Vet. App. at 46; see also Crowe v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 238, 245 (1994).  The Smith Court held that in light of the absence of evidence of an examination made contemporaneous with the Veteran's entry into service, the presumption of sound condition could not apply.  Smith, 24 Vet. App. at 46.

In this case, service treatment records do not indicate that the Veteran was examined prior to entrance onto active duty in December 1990.  Thus, the presumption of soundness is not for application and the Board must determine whether the Veteran's claimed back disability was as likely as not aggravated by service.  See Smith, 24 Vet. App. at 45-47.  

Having carefully reviewed the record, the Board has determined that the Veteran's back disability was aggravated by service.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board notes that the May 1991 DA Form 2173 submitted by the Veteran indicates insidious onset of back pain.  The provider specified that the injury was incurred/aggravated during assigned activities during Operation Desert Shield/Storm.  Given this record and the provider's conclusion that the injury was aggravated during active service and the current diagnoses whose symptoms have persisted since service, the Board finds that service connection is warranted.
