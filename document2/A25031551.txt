ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus (also claimed as ringing or hissing in ears) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus has been continuous since service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Veteran's tinnitus is presumed to have been incurred in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 1110, 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2005 to November 2013.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision on appeal. In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 AOJ rating decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300,?20.301, 20.801.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for diseases listed in 38 U.S.C. § 3.309 under the following circumstances: (1) where a chronic disease or injury is shown in service and subsequent manifestations of the same disease or injury are shown at a later date unless clearly attributable to an intercurrent cause; or (2) where there is continuity of symptomatology since service; or (3) by showing that the disorder manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307.

Tinnitus is recognized by VA as a "chronic disease" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a); therefore, the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.307, and 3.309 apply. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015). 

In relevant part, 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a) requires that the VA give "due consideration" to "all pertinent medical and lay evidence" in evaluating a claim to disability or death benefits. Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional." Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2007). In fact, competent medical evidence is not necessarily required when the determinative issue involves either medical etiology or a medical diagnosis. Id. at 1376-77; see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible. See Layno, supra (distinguishing between competency ("a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered") and credibility ("a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted").

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus (also claimed as ringing or hissing in ears)

The Veteran contends that his tinnitus is related to service. Specifically, the Veteran asserts that he went through several trainings on firing various weapons systems. See July 2024 VA 21-526EZ at 13. Additionally, the Veteran asserts that he would have to keep radio hand mics in each ear to monitor radio traffic while maneuvering, and eventually he noticed intermittent ringing in his ears. Id. 

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the August 2024 rating decision made the following favorable findings regarding the Veteran's tinnitus: (1) a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service, based on the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS); (2) the Veteran participated in a toxic risk activity (TERA), based on his personnel records showing service in Iraq and Kuwait; and (3) the Veteran has a diagnosis of tinnitus, confirmed during the July 2024 VA examination. No clear and unmistakable error has been shown by the evidence of record to rebut these favorable findings. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to discuss observed physical symptoms, such as ringing in the ears. See Layno, supra; see also Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002) ("ringing in the ears is capable of lay observation"). Tinnitus, moreover, is a disorder uniquely ascertainable by the senses. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). That is, tinnitus is defined as a ringing in the ears, a finding that can be determined by the Veteran's reporting of the condition.

As noted above, the Veteran has indicated that he experienced intermittent ringing in service. The Veteran reported that he currently experiences constant high-pitched ringing in both ears that is louder in the right ear. See July 2024 C&P Exam: DBQ at 6. Additionally, the Board notes that during the July 2024 VA examination, it was noted that the Veteran's symptoms began post-service. Id. However, the Veteran contends that the onset date is incorrect. See August 2024 VA Form 10182. As discussed above, the Veteran is competent to testify as to his observed symptoms. The Board finds that the Veteran's assertions are credible. As the evidence for and the evidence against the Veteran's claim is in relative equipoise, the Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt regarding the onset of his tinnitus symptoms. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

While the Board notes that the August 2024 VA examiner determined that the Veteran's tinnitus was not incurred in or otherwise etiologically related to service; however, the Board does not need to reach the weight assignable to the VA opinion because service connection is granted on a presumptive basis under 38 C.F.R. 3.303(b) for the "chronic" disease of tinnitus (38 C.F.R. 3.309(a)) based on a finding of "continuous" symptoms of tinnitus since service separation, all other service connection theories are rendered moot.

In this case, the evidence of record clearly shows that the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise as a result of his MOS. Additionally, the evidence shows that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus, per the August 2024 VA examination report. Moreover, the Board has afforded the Veteran the benefit of doubt regarding the onset of his tinnitus symptoms. Further, the evidence reveals that he wore hearing protection during his social noise exposure activities (post-service).  See August 2024 C&P Exam: DBQ at 5. Therefore, as the Veteran has reported experiencing tinnitus in service and continuously since separation from service, the Board finds that his tinnitus is presumed to have been incurred in service and the appeal is granted.
