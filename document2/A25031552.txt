DOCKET NO. 231207-399496
DATE: April 4, 2025

ORDER

The correction in the effective date for the 70 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder with panic attacks (PTSD) from August 12, 2021, to November 19, 2021, was proper.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 50 percent prior to November 19, 2021, and in excess of 70 percent from November 19, 2021, to September 26, 2022, and in excess of 100 percent from September 27, 2022, is denied. 

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 27, 2022, for the grant of eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is denied. 

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 27, 2022. for special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran continuously pursued his February 2019 claim for an increased rating for PTSD, but the evidence prior to November 19, 2021, did not show a higher rating was warranted.

2. Prior to November 19, 2021, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms associated with PTSD did not more closely approximate occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

3. From November 19, 2021, to September 26, 2022, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms do not more closely approximate total occupational and social impairment.

4. Since September 27, 2022, the Veteran's service-connected PTSD has been assigned a 100 percent disability rating, the highest available schedular rating under the relevant criteria, as well as SMC.

5. Prior to December 17, 2021, the Veteran was gainfully employed.  From December 17, 2021, until September 27, 2022, the Veteran was not unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation due to his service-connected disabilities.

6. The Veteran did not meet basic eligibility for DEA until September 27, 2022.

7. Prior to September 27, 2022, the Veteran did not have a 100 percent service-connected disability with an additional service-connected disability independently ratable at 60 percent; nor was he permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The correction in the effective date for the 70 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder with panic attacks (PTSD) from August 12, 2021, to November 19, 2021, was proper, in light of the clear and unmistakable error in the November 2021 rating decision.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5109A, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105, 3.344, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411, 3.2500.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating for PTSD greater than 50 percent prior to November 19, 2021, greater than 70 percent from November 19, 2021, to September 26, 2022, and greater than 100 percent thereafter have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

4. The criteria for entitlement to eligibility for DEA benefits, prior to September 27, 2022, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510, 5113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.807 (a), 21.3021.

5. The criteria for an effective date earlier than September 27, 2022, for SMC at the housebound rate have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 3.350, 3.352, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1990 to April 1996.

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). The law creates a new framework for veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review, and this decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

Procedurally, related to the issue of entitlement to higher ratings for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD, a November 2021 rating decision increased the rating to 70 percent, effective August 12, 2021.  Thereafter, on February 17, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, with respect to both the evaluation of PTSD and the effective date assigned. A March 2022 rating decision identified a duty to assist error related to the Veteran's claim, and a December 2022 rating decision found that a clear and unmistakable error was found in the effective date assigned for the 70 percent evaluation.  The Regional Office (RO) proposed a later effective date of November 19, 2021, for the 70 percent rating and simultaneously granted a 100 percent evaluation effective September 27, 2022.  A May 2023 rating decision assigned a 70 percent rating for PTSD effective November 19, 2021.  

As to the claims for entitlement to a TDIU, entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of SMC based on housebound criteria, and entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of DEA based on permanent and total disability status,  the December 2022 rating decision denied entitlement to a TDIU and granted entitlement to SMC based on housebound criteria and DEA based on permanent and total disability effective September 27, 2022, the date the Veteran was assigned a 100 percent rating for his service-connected PTSD.    

On December 7, 2023, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) where he selected the Direct Review lane without a Board hearing.  However, with the Form 10182, the Veteran's representative submitted a statement.  New evidence submitted with a VA Form 10182 on which the direct review option was selected may create uncertainty as to which Board review option was selected by the claimant, triggering the need for further clarification.  Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023). This case differs from Edwards, however, as the statement here involved argument in support of the appeal, and not evidence.  Therefore, it is not necessary to seek clarification as to whether he wishes to change dockets. As he selected the Direct Review docket, with respect to the PTSD claim, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the May 5, 2023, rating decision on appeal. With respect to the remaining claims, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the December 2, 2022, rating decision on appeal.

VA regulations provide that, "[u]pon request, a claimant is entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim... before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1).  That regulation does not indicate that the claimant is entitled to pre-decisional notice of this optional hearing.  In fact, 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(1) provides that, following a decision, "[c]laimants and their representatives are entitled to notice of any decision made by VA affecting the payment of benefits or the granting of relief... [including] the right to a hearing on any issue involved in the claim as provided in paragraph (d) of this section...."  Read together with § 3.103(d), the only notice § 3.103(b) requires is that a claimant be provided notice of the right for a hearing with notification of the decision (by definition, a post-decisional notice).  In November 2022, VA amended VA Form 21-526EZ and in May 2024 VA amended VA Form 20-0995 to inform claimants of the right to a hearing at any time during the claims process.  The claims in this appeal were filed on VA Form 21-526EZ prior to the amended version.  However, the Board finds that any error in the failure to inform the Veteran of the right to a pre-decisional hearing before the Regional Office (RO) was harmless error.  

In Bowen, the Court found that when a claimant is denied a hearing before the RO, there is no due process violation if he is subsequently offered the opportunity for a hearing before the Board, even if a hearing was not requested or conducted, as long as there is no violation of due process concerning the Board hearing opportunity. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253-4 (2012).  The facts in the case can be differentiated on several levels, to include that the Veteran did not actually request an RO hearing and the issue in Bowen was not one of notice.  Regardless, the Board cannot find a basis to conclude that the underlying holding and logic of the Bowen case would not lead to the same finding of no prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.  The December 7, 2022, and May 11, 2023, notification letters informing the Veteran of the rating decisions included a VA Form 20-0998, Your Right to Seek Review of Our Decision, outlining the Veteran's appeal options, to include a hearing before the Board.  Additionally, in the December 7, 2023, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran was provided with an option to request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge.  The Veteran instead selected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge, and the form explicitly states that by choosing this option, the Veteran does not want a Board hearing.  Because the Veteran was provided with notice of the right to appeal to the Board, as well as the right to a Board hearing, there was no due process violation in the processing of the claim or any suggestion that the Veteran was prejudiced by the failure of VA to provide a hearing at the RO level.  See Bowen. 

The December 2022 rating decision listed September 6, 2022, as the most recent VA medical record in the evidence list.  Subsequent to the December 2022 rating decision, VA records were added to the file covering the period through April 28, 2023. While ordinarily the Board may not consider evidence received outside the evidentiary window in its decision, see 38 C.F.R. § 20.300, when implementing the AMA, VA incorporated the constructive possession concept set forth in Turner in the drafting of § 3.103 (c) (2) (iii) for determining when constructive receipt occurs. See 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 141 (Jan. 18, 2019); see Turner v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 207, 218 (2018) (holding, in part, that constructive receipt requires "knowledge by VA adjudicators at the [Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA)] of the existence of those VA treatment records.").  Therefore, 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c)(2)(iii) explicitly states VA will not consider any evidence associated with the file after the AMA decision, to include evidence constructively received, unless VBA had knowledge of the existence of the records.  Here, a portion of the VA treatment records received after the December 2022 AMA decision consists of records of which VA was aware and some of which were actually considered in that decision, even though not added to the file until a later date.  Therefore, the VA records for treatment from September 6, 2022, until the date of the December 2, 2022, decision is considered constructively received prior to the decision on appeal under 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c)(2)(iii).  

However, the VA records for treatment after the December 2, 2022, decision are not part of the record on appeal and cannot be considered by the Board with respect to the TDIU, SMC, and DEA claims. The May 2023 rating decision included consideration of VA records through April 28, 2023. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Finally, the Veteran has a separate appeal pending under docket number 230328-334788 concerning his migraine headaches and hypertension. He will receive a separate Board decision on that appeal in the ordinary course of business.

Rating criteria

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Schedule, but that findings sufficient to identify the disease and the resulting disability and, above all, coordination of the rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21; see also Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).

When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings," in all claims for increased ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999).

The Veteran's PTSD is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130 directs that the disability is to be rated under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula).

Under the General Formula, the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The General Formula provides that a 50 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.

1. Whether the change in effective date of the 70 percent rating for PTSD was proper.

In the May 2023 rating decision, the RO changed the effective date for the 70 percent rating to November 19, 2021.  In the December 2022 rating decision, which proposed such a change, the RO noted that the November 29, 2021 rating decision committed a clear and unmistakable error in assigning the effective date of August 12, 2021, when the evaluation of PTSD was increased from 50 percent to 70 percent disabling, by incorrectly having applied the date the VA Form 20-0995 was received.  The RO further noted that the Veteran was provided a VA PTSD examination on November 19, 2021, which showed the first objective evidence of increased severity of the Veteran's PTSD condition to warrant an increased evaluation of 70 percent disabling.  The May 2023 rating decision implemented the December 2022 proposal.  

The Board finds that VA satisfied procedural requirements. Specifically, a December 2022 rating decision proposed the reduction and set forth all material facts and reasons for the reduction.  A February 2023 letter informed the Veteran that he would be given 60 days to present evidence to show that compensation payments should be continued at the present level.  The letter also notified the Veteran as to his right to a predetermination hearing.  In May 2023, more than 60 days after notification of the proposed reduction, a rating decision was issued that effectuated the reduction effective November 19, 2021.  

However, the Veteran's rating was not reduced based on any finding that the condition improved, but on the AOJ's determination that the effective date was clearly and unmistakably erroneous. Clear and unmistakable errors are errors that are undebatable, so that it can be said that reasonable minds could only conclude that the previous decision was fatally flawed at the time it was made. A determination that there was a clear and unmistakable error must be based on the record and the law that existed at the time of the prior decision. Once a determination is made that there was a clear and unmistakable error in a prior decision that would change the outcome, then that decision must be revised to conform to what the decision should have been. In this case, the disability evaluation is reduced because the previous decision was a clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

The Veteran was provided a VA PTSD examination in March 2019.  The VA examiner summarized the Veteran's level of occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  The Veteran reported that he lives with his wife and has impairment due to recurrent anxious episodes triggering panic attacks, increased irritability and inappropriate social interactions or disproportionate reactions to minor irritations and stressors, appearing withdrawn emotionally distant and isolative behaviors, and reduced energy caused by recurrent and traumatic nightmares.  The Veteran was retired and hopeful that he could get a job with the postal service.  The Veteran reported irritable behavior and angry outbursts, exaggerated startle response, problems with concentration and sleep disturbances.  The VA examiner noted symptoms of depressed mood; anxiety; panic attacks that occur weekly or less often chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events; flattened affect; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting.

The Veteran submitted a July 2020 private evaluation.  The Veteran reported nightmares and flashbacks.  He further reported feeling anxious, jittery, and hypervigilant.  The Veteran reported that he does not like being out in public, around groups of people, and has lost touch with most of his friends.  The Veteran reported verbal outbursts at home and at work.  He reported occasional suicidal ideations.  The Veteran reported panic attacks when he wakes up from nightmares.  Upon examination, the Veteran appeared morose in appearance, downcast, glum, guarded, irritable, attentive, communicative, casually groomed, and looked unhappy.  There were signs of severe depression.  There were no apparent signs of hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behaviors, or other indicators of psychotic process.  The Veteran's associations were intact, thinking logical, and thought content appeared appropriate.  Homicidal ideas or intentions were denied.  Short- and long-term memory were intact.  The Veteran was fully oriented.  Insight into problems and judgment were fair and there were no signs of anxiety.  

The Veteran was provided a VA PTSD examination in November 2021.  The VA examiner summarized the Veteran's level of occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  The Veteran reported that he worked part time for the post office as a custodian.  The Veteran reported having trouble falling and staying asleep and nightmares.  The Veteran reported hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disturbances.  The VA examiner noted symptoms of depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks that occur weekly or less often; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, direction or recent events; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships; impaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability and period of violence; and neglect of personal appearance and hygiene.

When the AOJ initially increased the rating to 70 percent, the August 2021 date of supplemental claim was assigned as the effective date. That was, however, incorrect, as the Veteran had continuously pursued his February 2019 claim for an increased rating, so the August 2021 supplemental claim was not a new claim, but continuation of the appeal of the February 2019 claim. However, continuous pursuit does not guarantee that a higher rating will be retroactive back to date of claim. Rather, in rating disabilities, VA must determine when the evidence showed the condition worsened, such that the next highest rating was warranted. Here, the AOJ found the effective date assigned was clearly and unmistakably erroneous because the evidence did not show the 70 percent rating was warranted until the November 2021 VA examination. The Board agrees. 

As noted by the AOJ, the effective date error was at the fault of VA. Therefore, despite the change in rating, no overpayment occurred as a result of this corrective action. As discussed in more detail below, the 2019 VA examination was consistent with the 50 percent rating, while the 2021 examination showed impairment consistent with a 70 percent rating. Prior to the November 2021 VA examination, the medical evidence showed the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's listed and unlisted symptoms most closely approximated the symptoms contemplated by a 50 percent rating, which are less severe, less frequent, and shorter in duration than those contemplated by a 70 percent rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126.  The Veteran did not exhibit symptoms consistent with this rating.  According to the Veteran he had a good relationship with his wife and children, despite his reported irritability. The Veteran regularly denied suicidal and homicidal ideations.  His personal appearance and hygiene were not described as neglectful.  The Veteran did not report and there is no evidence demonstrating that he suffered from near-continuous panic or depression affecting his ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively.

Based on regulatory provisions that ratings must be assigned consistent with when it is factually ascertainable that the rating was warranted, it was clearly legally incorrect for the AOJ to assign the date the supplemental claim was received as opposed to the date the medical evidence established worsening. As the AOJ did not correctly apply the regulatory provisions concerning effective dates, there was a clear and unmistakable legal error, and the decision to correct the effective date was proper. Again, since this action involved correction of an administrative error by VA, no overpayment was created, and the Veteran was informed he was not responsible for repaying any benefits that resulted from this error. 

2. Entitlement to higher disability ratings for PTSD.

A January 2017 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD with an initial rating of 50 percent effective September 9, 2016. He did not disagree with that decision, but he filed a claim for an increased rating in September 2017, which was denied in a November 2017 rating decision. He did not appeal that decision, and his next claim for an increased rating was received in February 2019, which was denied in a March 2019 rating decision. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, in March 2020. An August 2020 rating decision continued to deny the claim for an increased rating, and one year later, he filed a supplemental claim.  As discussed above, the November 2021 rating decision increased the rating to 70 percent, effective August 12, 2021.  However, a December 2022 rating decision found that a clear and unmistakable error was found in the effective date assigned for the 70 percent evaluation.  The Regional Office (RO) proposed a later effective date of November 19, 2021, for the 70 percent rating and simultaneously granted a 100 percent evaluation effective September 27, 2022.  A May 2023 rating decision assigned a 70 percent rating for PTSD effective November 19, 2021. 

Therefore, the Veteran continuously pursued his February 2019 claim for an increased rating. The applicable rating period is from February 17, 2019, date of claim, through May 5, 2023, the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. However, the Board will also review evidence dated within one year of receipt of claim (so, back to February 2018) to determine if worsening was shown.

The Veteran's PTSD is rated at 50 percent prior to November 19, 2021, 70 percent from November 19, 2021, to September 26, 2022, and 100 percent from September 27, 2022.  

Turning to the relevant evidence of record, a July 2018 VA mental health note reflects that the Veteran had occasional flashbacks and nightmares.  He endorsed anxiety especially in crowded places.  There was no evidence of extreme anxiety, despondency, or hopelessness.  There were no reports of manic/psychotic symptoms.  The Veteran denied current suicidal or homicidal thoughts, plan, or intent.  Upon examination, the Veteran was calm and cooperative.  His memory was intact and impulse control good.  He was oriented to person place and time.  

A February 2019 VA mental health note reflects that the Veteran reported feeling alright overall.  His mood was stable.  The Veteran reported frequent violent nightmares.  There was no evidence of extreme anxiety, despondency, and hopelessness.  There were no reports of manic/psychotic symptoms.  The Veteran denied suicidal or homicidal thoughts, plan or intent.  The Veteran further denied auditory/visual hallucinations and no delusions were elicited.  His memory was intact and impulse control good.  The Veteran was oriented to person, place, and time.

The Veteran was provided a VA PTSD examination in March 2019, and he submitted a July 2020 private evaluation. The results are reported above and will not be repeated here. 

An October 2020 VA mental health note the Veteran reported feeling more irritable, mood swings, having trouble sleeping, and ongoing nightmares.  There was no evidence of extreme anxiety, despondency, or hopelessness.  The Veteran did not report manic/psychotic symptoms.  He denied current suicidal or homicidal thoughts, plan, or intent.  Upon examination, the Veteran denied auditory/visual hallucinations.  No delusions were elicited.  The Veteran's memory was intact and impulse control was good.  He was oriented to person place and time. 

The Board finds, that prior to November 19, 2021, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's listed and unlisted symptoms most closely approximated the symptoms contemplated by a 50 percent rating, which are less severe, less frequent, and shorter in duration than those contemplated by a 70 percent rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126.  The Veteran did not exhibit symptoms consistent with this rating.  According to the Veteran he had a good relationship with his wife and children.  The Veteran regularly denied suicidal and homicidal ideations.  His personal appearance and hygiene were not described as neglectful.  The Veteran did not report and there is no evidence demonstrating that he suffered from near-continuous panic or depression affecting his ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively.   

The Board acknowledges that during the March 2019 VA examination, the Veteran reported increased irritability and inappropriate social interactions or disproportionate reactions to minor irritations and stressors.  He further reported frequent episodes of irritability resulting in verbal altercations with coworkers and superiors.  Impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence) is contemplated under the 70 percent criteria and is similar to persistent danger of hurting self or others, which is contemplated by the 100 percent criteria.  See Bankhead, 29 Vet. App. at 19.  However, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's irritability with periods of violence has not risen to the level contemplated by the 70 percent or 100 percent disability ratings.  The Veteran's VA mental health treatment records and VA examinations reflect that he reported a good relationship with his spouse.  The Board does not minimize the gravity of the Veteran's irritability resulting in verbal altercations with coworkers and superiors.  Indeed, impaired impulse control is explicitly listed as an example symptom under the 70 percent rating criteria.  However, the Board finds that, overall, the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology does not more closely approximate the criteria for a rating in excess of 70 percent, prior to November 19, 2021, because, as noted above, the Veteran's other remaining symptoms were either contemplated by or more consistent with a rating of no higher than 50 percent.  See also Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. 436; Vasquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 117 (The General Formula is meant to provide a regulatory framework for placing veterans on a disability spectrum based upon their objectively observable symptoms).   

The Veteran was provided a VA examination in November 2021.  The results are reported above and will not be repeated here. That examination showed that the Veteran's PTSD was manifested by symptoms associated with a 70 percent rating or lower, including depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, impaired impulse control.  He also had symptoms that are not listed with a specific rating, such as the hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response, which are similar to impaired judgment.  The Board finds the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's unlisted symptoms more closely approximate the symptoms contemplated by a 70 percent rating or lower, which are less severe, less frequent, and shorter in duration than those contemplated by a 100 percent rating.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran had neglect of personal appearance and hygiene.  Neglect of personal hygiene is contemplated under the 70 percent criteria and is similar to intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene), which is contemplated by the 100 percent criteria.  See Bankhead, 29 Vet. App. at 19.  However, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's neglect of personal hygiene has not risen to the level contemplated by the 100 percent disability ratings.  During the November 2021 VA examination, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran was poorly groomed, and his hair was uncombed.  The VA examiner did not note an intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living.  As such, the Board finds that, from November 19, 2021, to September 26, 2022, the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology does not more closely approximate the criteria for a rating in excess of 70 percent because, as noted above, the Veteran's other remaining symptoms were either contemplated by or more consistent with a rating of no higher than 70 percent.  See also Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. 436; Vasquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 117 (The General Formula is meant to provide a regulatory framework for placing veterans on a disability spectrum based upon their objectively observable symptoms).

The Veteran was provided a VA examination in September 2022.  The VA examiner summarized the Veteran's level of occupational and social impairment as total occupational and social impairment.  The Veteran reported that he argues with his wife a lot leading him to be irritable, verbally aggressive, and throwing things in anger.  The Veteran reported that when he was working, he was frequently verbally aggressive and punched bathroom stalls.  He reported being insubordinate, failing to comply, and not getting along with others.  The Veteran reported irritable behavior and angry outburst, reckless or self-destructive behavior, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, problems with concentration, and sleep disturbances.  The VA examiner noted symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, near-continuous depression, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impairment of short and term memory, flatted affect, impaired judgment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, suicidal ideation, impaired impulse control, and neglect of personal appearance and hygiene.  Upon examination, the Veteran was oriented to person/place/time/situation.  He was open and cooperative.  The Veteran's thought processes were clear, coherent, and goal directed.  No evidence of delusions was elicited.  Auditory and visual hallucinations were denied.  Suicidal ideations, without a plan or intent was reported.  Homicidal ideation was denied.

From September 27, 2022, the Veteran was awarded a 100 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.  This is this highest schedular rating available under this Diagnostic Code. Therefore, a higher rating is unavailable. 

In summary, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent prior to November 19, 2021, in excess of 70 percent from November 19, 2021, to September 26, 2022, and in excess of 100 percent from September 27, 2022, for PTSD were not met.  Thus, the Board concludes that the evidence for and against the claim is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the claim.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

TDIU

3. Entitlement to a TDIU is denied.

First, the Veteran is rated as 100 percent disabled and is in receipt of SMC payable at the housebound rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s), from September 27, 2022.  Therefore, the award of a TDIU, from September 27, 2022, would result in no further benefit, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is rendered moot from September 27, 2022, and the Board need not consider the issue of entitlement to a TDIU from September 27, 2022.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).

The Veteran seeks entitlement to a TDIU based on the combined effects of his service-connected disabilities.  In an April 2022 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported that he last worked full time in December 2021 and that he became too disabled to work in December 2021.

A TDIU may be assigned when the schedular rating is less than total and a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).  To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Id. 

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id.  The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment.  Id.  Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity).  Id. 

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training.  See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014).  It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability.  Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  The ultimate question is whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The Veteran had the following disabilities that were service connected during the relevant period, PTSD rated as 50 percent disabling prior to November 19, 2021, and 70 percent disabling from September 19, 2021, to September 26, 2022; obstructive sleep apnea, rated as 50 percent disabling from June 29, 2020; migraine headaches, rated as 30 percent disabling from January 29, 2019; and hypertension, rated as noncompensable from January 29, 2019.  The Veteran's combined rating was 70 percent disabling prior to June 29, 2020, 80 percent disabling from June 29, 2020, to November 18, 2021, and 90 percent disabling from November 19, 2021, to September 26, 2022.  For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran has satisfied the schedular rating criteria for a TDIU under C.F.R. § 4.16 (a) since he had at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.

In the April 2022 VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, the Veteran reported that he is unemployable due to his service-connected PTSD, migraines, and sleep apnea.  He reported he last worked full-time in December 2021 as a custodian for the post office.  He further reported he worked as a corrections officer from September 2000 to October 2018.  During the July 2020 private examination, the Veteran reported that he has a bachelor's degree in criminal justice.  

During the March 2019 VA PTSD examination, the Veteran reported that he retired from the State Correctional Institute where he worked for 20 years.  He further reported that he was hopeful about securing other work with the USPS.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's frequent episodes of irritability resulting in verbal altercations with coworkers and superiors, reduced motivation and mood, difficulty managing increased job-related demands due to reduced frustration tolerance and disturbances with concentration and forgetfulness produced moderate impairment in terms of productivity and efficiency. 

During a June 2021 VA sleep apnea examination, the Veteran reported that has poor functionality and falls asleep at work.  He further reported difficulty thinking, problems sleeping and severe tiredness.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran feels tired and sluggish and has to take a nap at work.  The VA examiner further noted the Veteran has difficulty standing for long periods or walking without assistance.  The VA examiner further noted difficulty with activities like buttoning and tying laces.

During an October 2021 VA headaches examination, the Veteran reported headaches with photophobia and sound sensitivity.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's headache condition impacts his ability to work since while experiencing a bad headache, he cannot accomplish any task that required concentration.

During the November 2021 VA PTSD examination, the Veteran reported that he has been a post office custodian for the past two years.  The Veteran reported that he sleeps an average of less than five hours a night.  He further reported that he has a problem with women in authority and women who like to abuse their power.  The Veteran reported that he was on the verge of losing his current job since his female supervisor "is always on him for stupid stuff."  He reported that he got upset and yelled at her.  The Veteran reported that he has poor attendance, leaves early, and he calls out of work six to seven times per month.  He reported that he was moved to a position in the back by himself, which he likes.  

First, for the period on appeal prior to the Veteran leaving his job on December 17,  2021, TDIU is not warranted because the Veteran was gainfully employed. From April 2019 until he left his job at the Post Office in December 2021, he reported his highest gross earnings were $3,000/month, and his earnings over the 12-month period prior to his TDIU claim form in April 2022 were $50,000. Clearly, then, his earnings were not marginal, even if he had to miss time from work (which is exactly what VA disability benefits compensate for), nor was he working in a protected environment, as VA defines that term.  Again, he has a 100 percent rating plus SMC from September 27, 2022.  Therefore, the claim for TDIU is denied for the period on appeal prior to December 17, 2021, as he was gainfully employed, and it is moot from September 27, 2022. The only question that remains, then, is whether TDIU was warranted between December 17, 2021, and September 27, 2022. The Board concludes it was not.

Due to his service-connected disabilities, the Veteran was essentially limited to work that does not require close communication with coworkers, supervisors, or the general public on an ongoing basis and is simple and routine in nature.  With such an occupational profile, the Veteran would be able to perform a wide range of work that is repetitive and predictable in nature, is mostly performed independently, and does not require ongoing training or other activities that would require close communication with coworkers or supervisors, such as sorting, inspection, and assembly work.  It must be noted that recent VA records indicate he is mentally stable, cognitively intact, and independent with his activities of daily living.  While his mental health condition would present challenges for him in the work environment, his medical records do not show it would interfere with employment. 

The Board has considered the Veteran's level of education.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. The Board finds that the Veteran's college education is not inconsistent with an ability to perform simple and routine work, such as sorting, inspection, or assembly work.  The Board has also considered the Veteran's work history.  He worked for a long period as a corrections officer and custodian and stopped working in 2021. The Board finds that the Veteran's long history of working in the same profession would not have prevented him from transitioning to a simple and routine occupation, or from securing or following a simple and routine job, which does not require special training and can be learned on the job site.   

The Board does not doubt the Veteran's reports that his service-connected disabilities limited his functional abilities.  However, the record reflects that such impairment has been adequately compensated by the current schedular ratings. Loss of industrial capacity is the principal factor in assigning disability ratings. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321 (a), 4.1.  Indeed, 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 specifically states: "Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability."  See also Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993) (noting that the disability rating itself is recognition that industrial capabilities are impaired).

The Board does not doubt that the Veteran experienced irritability, anxiety, panic attacks and angry outbursts as detailed at both VA and private examinations throughout the appeal period.  However, the Board finds that these symptoms are not of such severity to prevent him from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment.  Aside from general reports of occasions of angry outbursts, there is little suggestion that his behavior during the period on appeal would inhibit employability in a wide range of jobs.  The weight of the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran received accommodations (albeit likely implicit in nature) in his prior job and adjusted his schedule so as to minimize the impact of his psychiatric symptoms.

As for the evidence indicating that he would require accommodations as to certain psychiatric symptoms, the Board does not disagree with this possibility but also notes that a need for accommodations to work does not equate to finding that he cannot do so.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), in addition to other federal and state laws, open the doors for people with disabilities to apply for, obtain, and maintain gainful employment.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq.  The ADA generally requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations" for people with disabilities in the application and employment processes.  42 U.S.C. § 12111 (9).  The Board may reasonably infer that he could work in a role suited to his education, skills, and experience if provided reasonable accommodations, such as the ability to manage his emotions or take a break when needed.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011) (Board is entitled to utilize common sense in drawing reasonable inferences from the facts of record).  Indeed, the evidence supports finding that the Veteran is not precluded from engaging in a wide variety of unskilled or semi-skilled jobs that are repetitive and predictable in nature and mostly performed independently away from the public.  As discussed above, such work is consistent with his occupational background and education, and reasonable accommodations in managing his emotions would seemingly accommodate the impact of his psychiatric symptoms.

Given the extensive range of work available to individuals with the Veteran's occupational profile, the Board concludes that there is not sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran was unemployable by reason of his service-connected disabilities between December 17, 2021, and September 27, 2022.  As the Veteran's service-connected disabilities did not render him unable to secure or maintain substantially gainful employment, a TDIU is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

4. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC chapter 35 is denied.

Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), effective dates relating to awards under Chapter 35 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 5113.  Subsection (b) provides that when determining the effective date of an award under Chapter 35 for an individual described in paragraph (b) (2) of 38 U.S.C. § 5113, based on an original claim, VA may consider the individual's application as having been filed on the eligibility date of the individual if that eligibility date is more than one year before the date of the initial rating decision.  For these purposes, "eligibility date" means the date on which the individual became an eligible person as defined by 38 U.S.C. § 3501 (a)(1), and "initial rating decision" means a decision by VA that establishes the veteran's total disability as permanent in nature. 38 U.S.C. § 5113 (b)(3).

In the case of a veteran who is alive, the conditions for basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) include: (1) the Veteran's discharge from service under conditions other than dishonorable; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.807 (a).  Total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  Total disability may or may not be permanent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340 (a).  Permanence of disability will be taken to exist when such impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340 (b).  The term "total disability permanent in nature" for the purpose of DEA benefits means any disability rated total for the purposes of disability compensation which is based on impairment reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person.  38 U.S.C. § 3501 (a)(7).

The Veteran was awarded eligibility to DEA effective September 27, 2022, based upon the finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities were 100 percent permanent in nature.  Since the effective date for DEA benefits was directly predicated on finding that the Veteran had a 100 percent disability that was permanent in nature, September 27, 2022, is the earliest date at which the Veteran could establish eligibility for DEA benefits.  Accordingly, as none of the other criteria for DEA, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.807, have been met at any time prior to September 27, 2022, entitlement to an earlier effective date for DEA benefits is denied.

5. Entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate prior to September 27, 2022, is denied.

SMC at the housebound rate is payable where a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i).  In Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008), the Court held that a TDIU rating based on a single disability to satisfy the statutory requirement of a total rating.

The evidence of record reflects that effective September 27, 2022, entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate was granted on the basis of PTSD rated as 100 percent disabling from September 27, 2022, and additional service-connected disabilities of obstructive sleep apnea (rated as 50 percent disabling from June 29, 2020) and migraines (rated as 30 percent disabling from January 29, 2019).

Prior to September 27, 2022, however, the Veteran did not meet the statutory requirements for SMC at the housebound rate as he did not have a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i)(1).  As the Board is denying TDIU prior to September 27, 2022, there is no question as to whether he was unemployable due to a single disability, such that he could qualify for SMC, because the Board finds he was not unemployable due to his service-connected conditions.

Moreover, the evidence does not show that prior to September 27, 2022, the Veteran was substantially confined as a direct result of his service-connected disabilities to his dwelling and the immediate premises. In this regard, during the March 2019 and November 2021 VA PTSD examinations, the VA examiners noted that the Veteran consistently worked as a corrections officer and custodian.  Notwithstanding, in this examination report, there is no evidence the Veteran was substantially confined to his dwelling and the immediate premises as a result of his service-connected PTSD.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i)(2). Thus, the evidence does not show that the Veteran was permanently housebound by reason of his service-connected disabilities prior to September 27, 2022.

In sum, the Board finds the most probative evidence is against the award of an effective date prior to September 27, 2022, because the Veteran did not have a 100 percent service-connected disability with an additional service-connected disability independently ratable at 60 percent; nor was he permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
