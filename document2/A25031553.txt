FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively establishes that the Veteran's tinnitus manifested within one year of his separation from service and has been chronic since manifestation.

2. The Veteran was in an active duty for training status when his left ankle sprain occurred.

3. The Veteran had qualifying service in Southwest Asia and has been diagnosed with tension headaches.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307(a), 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for left ankle osteoarthritis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304. 

3. The criteria for service connection for tension headaches are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1113, 1117, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307(a), 3.309. 3.317.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in Marine Corps from December 1990 to June 1991.  The Veteran also served on period of active duty for training in the Marine Corps from November 1988 to June 1989.

This appeal is being processed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017.  115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  The Veteran timely initiated an appeal by submitting a June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), and elected the elected the Hearing docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the AOJ issued the May 2022 rating decision on appeal, as well, as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  To establish entitlement to service-connected compensation benefits, a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

For veterans with 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic diseases, including organic diseases of the nervous system such as sensorineural hearing loss, are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), where a chronic disease, such as sensorineural hearing loss or tinnitus, is shown as such in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease are generally service connected.  If a chronic disease is noted in service but chronicity in service is not adequately supported, a showing of continuity of symptomatology after separation is required.  Entitlement to service connection based on chronicity or continuity of symptomatology pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) applies only when the disability for which the Veteran is claiming compensation is due to a disease enumerated on the list of chronic diseases in 38 U.S.C. § 1101(3) or 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may also be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

Ordinarily a lay person is?competent?to report symptoms and experiences observable?by their senses; however, a lay person is?usually?not competent?to prove a matter requiring medical expertise. See Jandreau v. Nicholson,?492 F.3d 1372, 1377?(Fed. Cir. 2007); Layno v. Brown,?6 Vet. App. 465, 470?(1994).

1. The issue of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran contends that his tinnitus is related to his active-duty military service.  See December 2024 Board Hearing Transcript.

In the May 2022 rating decision, the AOJ made the following favorable findings: (1) there was a qualifying event, injury, or disease during service as the Veteran was a tractor trailer operator which is consistent with acoustic trauma; and (2) the Veteran has a diagnosed disability of tinnitus.  No clear or unmistakable errors have been shown to rebut these findings; therefore, these favorable findings are binding on the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The remaining question is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and his military service.

In a March 2022 examination and medical opinion, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not the result of military noise exposure. The opinion relied on the Veteran's hearing test, military occupational specialty, and post-service noise exposure both occupational and recreational.  The examiner did not provide any rationale or analysis for the conclusion or the reliance on the noted evidence. 

At the Board hearing in December 2024, the Veteran testified that he has suffered from tinnitus since he was in service.

The Board acknowledges that tinnitus is a condition capable of both lay observation and diagnosis.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  The Veteran is competent to report symptoms such as ringing or buzzing in his ears as this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007).  In addition, the Veteran is competent to identify a disorder such as tinnitus for diagnostic purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 310; Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 405 (1995).  

Further, the Board finds the Veteran's assertions regarding the onset of his tinnitus adequate and credible.  As noted above, tinnitus is a disability eligible for service connection on a presumptive basis as a chronic disease.  The Veteran's competent and credible lay statements are the most probative evidence of record.  His lay statements sufficiently establish that his tinnitus was shown to be a chronic disease with manifestation within one year of service as required by the presumptive period, and that it has continued since that time.  See Charles, 16 Vet. App. at 374.  The evidence of record shows that the Veteran's tinnitus pre-dates any post-service intercurrent causes.  The Board finds the Veteran's opinion related to his tinnitus probative. 

Given the Veteran's probative lay statements, the Board finds that a nexus has been established and the evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of granting the Veteran's claim for service connection for tinnitus on a presumptive basis as a chronic disease.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  Therefore, service connection for tinnitus is warranted.

2. The issue of service connection for left ankle osteoarthritis.

The Veteran contends that his left ankle osteoarthritis is due to a left ankle injury during boot camp.  See December 2024 Board Hearing Transcript. 

In the May 2022 rating decision, the AOJ made the following favorable findings: (1) there was a qualifying event during service as the Veteran was treated for his left ankle during inactive duty for training; (2) the Veteran has a diagnosed disability of left ankle osteoarthritis, and (3) there is a nexus between the left ankle disability and the Veteran's military service.  With the exception of the characterization of the Veteran's status when injury occurred, no clear or unmistakable errors have been shown to rebut these findings; therefore, these favorable findings are binding on the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran was in an active duty for training status from November 1988 to June 1989.  See DD 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.   A February 6, 1989 Service Treatment Record (STR) entry shows a left ankle sprain during boot camp.  Thus, the injury occurred while the Veteran was in an active duty for training status and service connection for a left ankle disability is warranted.

3. The issue of entitlement to service connection for tension headaches.

The Veteran contends that his tension headaches are due to his active-duty military service in the Persian Gulf War.  See March 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.

In the May 2022 rating decision, the AOJ made the following favorable findings: (1) the Veteran has sufficient service to meet the requirements for presumptive service connection; (2) the Veteran performed service in Southwest Asia (Saudi Arabia); (3) the Veteran was exposed to environmental hazards during service (SW Asia); (4) the claimed disability is a chronic disease that may be presumptively connected to military service; and (5) the Veteran has a diagnosed disability of tension headaches.  No clear or unmistakable errors have been shown to rebut these findings; therefore, these favorable findings are binding on the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service connection may be granted for a Persian Gulf veteran with a qualifying chronic disability that became manifest to any degree at any time.  38 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(1).  A qualifying chronic disability is a chronic disability that may result from an undiagnosed illness or a medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (MUCMI).  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(i).

A Persian Gulf veteran is defined as a veteran who served on active military, naval or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e)(1).  The Southwest Asia theater of operations refers to Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, and the airspace above these locations.  Id. § 3.317(e)(2).  The period of the Persian Gulf War is from August 2, 1990, through the present.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2(i). 

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, was enacted on August 10, 2022.  Section 405 of the PACT Act reduces the threshold for establishing eligibility when considering presumptive service connection for Persian Gulf War veterans.  Presumptive conditions under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a) and (b) may now manifest to any degree at any time.

A VA examination was conducted in March 2022.  The examiner noted the Veteran had a diagnosis of tension headaches.  The examiner classified the Veteran's tension headaches as a diagnosable but medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness of unknown etiology.  See VA examination of March 2022

As such, resolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that service connection for the Veteran's tension headaches is warranted on a presumptive basis.  38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(1).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. The issue of entitlement to service connection for hearing loss.

The Veteran contends that his hearing loss is due to his active-duty military service.  See March 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.

In the May 2022 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable finding that the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of tractor trailer operator was consistent with acoustic trauma and therefore conceded a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service.  No clear or unmistakable errors have been shown to rebut this finding; therefore, this favorable finding is binding on the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The remaining questions are whether the Veteran has a hearing loss disability and whether there is a nexus between the disability and the Veteran's active-duty military service.

For VA purposes, hearing loss is a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran was provided with a VA examination in March 2022.  The examination attempted to test the Veteran's auditory thresholds, but ultimately could not.  Further, the examiner noted that the reliability of the test was poor and test results were not valid for rating purposes. 

Remand by the Board under the AMA is proper for a correction of duty to assist error which occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist error).  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Once an examination or medical opinion has been obtained, it must be adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  A medical opinion is inadequate if it is based on an inaccurate factual basis.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (an opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value).

Here, the medical opinion was based on the inaccurate factual basis that the Veteran had normal hearing despite the inability to test the Veteran's hearing.   Accordingly, the Board finds the only medical opinion of record is inadequate and represents a pre-decisional duty to assist error that must be cured on remand.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

2. The issue of entitlement to service connection for hypothyroidism.

The Veteran contends his hypothyroidism is due to his active-duty military service.  See March 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.

In the May 2022 rating decision, the AOJ made the following favorable findings: (1) the Veteran has sufficient service to meet the requirements for presumptive service connection; (2) the Veteran performed service in Southwest Asia (Saudi Arabia); (3) the Veteran was exposed to environmental hazards during service (SW Asia); and (4) the Veteran has a diagnosed disability of hypothyroidism.  No clear or unmistakable errors have been shown to rebut these findings; therefore, these favorable findings are binding on the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Under the PACT Act, VA must provide a medical examination and opinion if a veteran submits a compensation claim with evidence of participation in a toxic exposure risk activity during active service and that evidence is insufficient to establish service connection for the disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1168(a).

The Board notes that the Veteran has presumed toxic exposure due to service in Southwest Asia, namely, Saudia Arabia.  See December 2022 Toxic Exposure Memorandum; January 2023 Persian Gulf Veteran Memorandum.

The Veteran meets the above requirements, but the Veteran has not been provided with a TERA examination.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a medical opinion from an examiner to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed bilateral hearing loss disability.  The need for an in-person examination is left to the examiner proffering the opinion.  

In rendering an opinion, the examiner should:

(a.) Opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was caused by his active-duty military service and explain why or why not. 

(b.) In doing so, the examiner should consider the relevant lay and medical evidence of record.

2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination and obtain a medical opinion from an examiner to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed hypothyroidism disability.  

(a.) In rendering an opinion, the examiner should opine as to whether the Veteran's current hypothyroidism disability was incurred in or otherwise caused by his active-duty service;

(b.) The examiner should also opine as to whether the Veteran's hypothyroidism is a result of the synergistic effects of the Veteran's total toxic exposure in service;
