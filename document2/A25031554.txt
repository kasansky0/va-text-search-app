ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's tinnitus is etiologically related to his military noise exposure.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from June 1994 to June 1998.

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeal (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 

In August 2024, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), in which he expressed disagreement with the decision on appeal. The Veteran elected the Direct Review option. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110;38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Generally, service connection requires: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For certain chronic disorders, including tinnitus, service connection may be granted if the disease becomes manifest to a compensable degree within one year following separation from service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137;38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. In such cases, the disease is presumed under the law to have had its onset in service even if there is no evidence of such disease during service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a); see Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015). Alternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the weight of the evidence is in approximate balance. If the positive and negative evidence is evenly or approximately balanced, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, which he contends was incurred in service due to military noise exposure. 

As an initial matter, the Board notes that in the rating decision on appeal the Veteran's exposure to hazardous noise during military service was conceded. Moreover, the rating decision found the Veteran carries a current diagnosis of tinnitus.

The question remaining before the Board is whether the Veteran's tinnitus is etiologically related to his in-service noise exposure. Based on a careful review of the subjective and clinical evidence of record, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.

The Veteran underwent a VA audiology examination in June 2018 and September 2023 in which the examiners provided negative nexus opinions.

Conversely, the Veteran submitted an opinion from a private registered nurse, P.L.D., APRN, in July 2023 that stated that the Veteran's tinnitus is at least as likely as not the result of the Veteran's active service. The private registered nurse provided a conclusion adequately supported by medical rationale based on the Veteran's noise exposure in service. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 300 (2008) (holding that conclusions that are factually accurate, fully articulated, and contain sound reasoning contribute to the probative value of a medical opinion).

In light of the foregoing, the Board concludes that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of the issue, and the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When the evidence is in approximate balance or nearly equal, the claim is to be granted. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Accordingly, service connection for the Veteran's tinnitus is granted.
