ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a gynecological condition, to include hysterectomy, claimed as endometriosis (adenomyosis), is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's hysterectomy is related to a disease or injury incurred during a period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish service connection for hysterectomy have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.6, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army Reserve from September 2001 to February 2011. She served on active duty from February 2003 to December 2004. She also had periods of ACDUTRA service, including from June 10, 2006, to June 23, 2006. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an August 2024 decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). That decision is a higher-level review decision of an AOJ decision issued in January 2024. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Under the Direct Review option, the Board's decision will be based on the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.801(a). In the case of a higher-level review decision, the evidentiary record is limited to the evidence of record as of the date that the AOJ issued notice of the prior decision under review. 38 U.S.C. § 5104B(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601(f).

Accordingly, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision, which was subject to higher-level review in the August 2024 decision on appeal. See id.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 20.301, 20.801(a). If evidence was submitted by the Veteran or otherwise added to the claims file since the AOJ decision on appeal, the Board has not considered it at this time. See id. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for a gynecological disorder, claimed as endometriosis (adenomyosis). The claims file indicates that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a hysterectomy. In order to accurately reflect the nature of the Veteran's disability, the Board has expanded the claim, per Clemons, to entitlement to service connection for a gynecological condition, to include hysterectomy. These changes are reflected on the title page and provide the most favorable review of the Veteran's claim in keeping with the holding in Clemons. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

Entitlement to service connection for a gynecological condition, to include hysterectomy. 

Service connection generally will be awarded when a veteran has a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Active service includes (1) active duty, (2) any period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) during which the individual concerned was disabled from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, and (3) any period of inactive duty training (INACDUTRA) during which the individual concerned was disabled from an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty or from an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident which occurred during such training. See 38 U.S.C. §101(24); 38 C.F.R. §3.6(a). ACDUTRA is, inter alia, full-time duty in the Armed Forces performed by Reserves for training purposes. See 38 U.S.C. §101(22)(A); 38 C.F.R. §3.6(c)(1).

To establish service connection on a direct basis, the evidence must show: (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a link between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service (the "nexus" element). Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

The determination as to whether the elements of service connection are met is based on an analysis of all evidence of record and an evaluation of its credibility and probative value. See Jones v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 219, 225 (2002). The Board is required to consider all pertinent medical and lay evidence when evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); see also Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 367-68 (2005) (holding that the Board must assess the credibility of and weight to be given to the evidence).

Competent lay evidence is any kind of evidence that does not require that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994).

Competent medical evidence is necessary where the determinative question is one that requires medical knowledge. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Competent medical evidence is provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions. See Cox v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 563, 569 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1). It may also include sound medical principles found in medical treatises and statements contained in authoritative writings such as medical and scientific articles and research reports or analyses. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1). 

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. However, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the evidence is not in approximate balance and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Here, the Veteran seeks service connection for a gynecological condition, claimed as endometriosis (adenomyosis). For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that service connection is warranted. As service connection is being granted on a direct basis, no other theory of entitlement will be addressed.

In the August 2024 decision on appeal, the AOJ made favorable findings including that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a hysterectomy. This finding is binding on the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The record also reflects diagnoses including abnormal uterine bleeding, endometriosis (adenomyosis) and hysterectomy due to adenomyosis. See, e.g., December 2023 Gynecological Condition DBQ; October 2023 Gynecological Condition DBQ; Private Treatment Records, King's Daughters Medical Ctr., September 2023. Therefore, the first element to establish service connection is satisfied.  

The Veteran's service treatment records show that she experienced abnormal uterine bleeding in June 2006 while on duty. See Service Treatment Records, June 2006. A Statement of Medical Examination and Duty Status (DA Form 2173) dated June 2006 indicates that the Veteran was on active duty for training at Ft. McLellan, Alabama at the time of this incident, and a September 2006 line of duty investigation yielded a final determination of "In Line of Duty." Thus, the Veteran's injury or disease involving abnormal uterine bleeding was incurred during a period of ACDUTRA service, and an incurrence of a disease or injury in active service is established. 

The remaining question is whether there is a nexus between the in-service incurrence and a current disability. The Board finds that the evidence persuasively establishes a nexus between the Veteran's hysterectomy and her in-service injury or disease. 

The Veteran was afforded Gynecological Condition DBQs and Medical Opinion DBQs in October 2023, December 2023, and August 2024. However, only the December 2023 VA examiner addressed the issue of direct service connection. In the December 2023 Gynecological Condition DBQ, the Veteran reported that her condition had its onset in June 2006 while on duty and reported symptoms including abnormal bleeding. In the December 2023 Medical Opinion DBQ, examiner NP G.K. opined that the Veteran's claimed condition was at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by an in-service injury, event, or illness; and specifically, that her in-service abnormal uterine bleeding was related to her diagnosis of endometriosis (adenomyosis). For a rationale, the examiner indicated that the Veteran had no abnormal uterine bleeding prior to military service; that there was evidence of chronicity; and that the abnormal uterine bleeding escalated into the condition of endometriosis (adenomyosis) that led to a hysterectomy. 

The Board finds the December 2023 Medical Opinion DBQ to be persuasive. The VA examiner applied a valid medical analysis to the significant facts of this case, including by considering the Veteran's description of the June 2006 incident and her post-service symptoms. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). Therefore, the Board finds the evidence establishes that there is a causal link between the Veteran's current diagnosis of hysterectomy and her injury or disease involving abnormal uterine bleeding during her period of ACDUTRA service.
