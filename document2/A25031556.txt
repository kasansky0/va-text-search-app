ORDER

Entitlement to an initial 30 percent rating for headaches is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the entire duration of the appeal period, the Veteran's headaches have resulted in characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over last several months

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an initial 30 percent rating for headaches have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2008 to May 2015. 

The Veteran filed an initial disability claim in May 2023, which was granted by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in August 2023. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by application of the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; see generally 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating. Otherwise, the lower rating applies. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability determinations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Where, as here, the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). When the factual findings show distinct time periods during which the Veteran exhibited symptoms of disability and such symptoms warrant different disability ratings, staged ratings may be assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 780-81 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

Entitlement to an initial 30 percent rating for headaches. 

The Veteran contends, through his representative, that his noncompensable disability rating for headaches, should be increased to 30 percent, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100. The Board agrees, and find an increase in disability rating, to 30 percent, for the Veteran's service-connected headaches, is warranted. 

Under Diagnostic Code 8100, a 10 percent rating is assigned for migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once every two months over the last several months. A 30 percent rating is assigned for migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months. A maximum 50 percent rating is assigned for migraine headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The Board notes that the criteria for a 30 percent and a 50 percent rating contain several undefined phrases. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has provided some clarity in understanding the rating criteria. The Court has held that the phrase "characteristic prostrating attack" contained in the criteria for a 30 percent rating "plainly describes migraine attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality." Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018). Further, the term "very frequent" contained in the 50 percent criterion, while inexact, connotes a frequency greater than the "once a month" requirement for a 30 percent rating. Id. at 253. The Court further concluded that to be completely prostrating, the headaches "must render the Veteran entirely powerless." Id. The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract." Id. Finally, the use of the conjunctive "and" makes clear that all criteria must be met to warrant a 50 percent rating. Id.

Similarly, the rating criteria also do not define "severe economic inadaptability." However, the Court has indicated that this term is not synonymous with being completely unable to work and that the phrase "productive of" could be read to mean either "producing" or "capable of producing" severe economic inadaptability. See Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 446-47 (2004). Therefore, the Board notes that the migraines must be, at a minimum, capable of producing severe economic inadaptability.

Finally, the Board notes that the ameliorative effects of medications used to treat the Veteran's headaches may not be considered when evaluating the level of severity of the disability. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).

As noted above, the Veteran submitted an initial claim for service connection for headaches in May 2023, at that time, he wrote that his headaches occur 4-5 times per month. "The headache pain generally occurs on the left side of my head and behind my eyes. At least 3-4 times per month, they knock me out of commission to the point that I am totally incapacitated and unable to do any normal daily activities for 6 hours. When my headaches knock me out of commission, I will take an Imitrex and lay in bed in a dark room. During my headaches, I have light sensitivity, noise sensitivity, flashing or shimmering lights, nausea, weakness, dizziness, and lightheadedness. I am prescribed Imitrex to help treat these symptoms. There is not a lot to do to comfort it until it passes. The room will start to spin, and I will get nauseous and then vomit. Most of the time the medication does not seem to do much. In the last 12 months, I have missed at least a week of work due to my episodes. I have missed events and activities due to my headaches because they render me unable to function at all during the time of my headaches." See May 2023 VA 21-4138. 

In August 2023, the Veteran was afforded an in-person VA examination, where his records, including his VA e-folder, were reviewed. Significantly, the examiner reported that the Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine at a frequency greater than once per month. Notably, while the examiner found that the Veteran's headache disability impacted his ability work, it was also noted that the Veteran worked for had lost less than one week of work the last 12 months due to his headaches.  Specifically, the Veteran worked in the marketing department for a medical device company and would occasionally find it hard to concentrate while at work due to his headaches, specifically looking at a monitor and traveling. See August 2023 C&P Exam.

As noted, prior, the criteria for a 30 percent disability rating are met for migraine headaches, characteristic prostrating attacks occur on an average of once a month, over the last several months. The Board finds that the Veteran meets the criteria of an increased rating to a 30 percent disability, for the time period on appeal. As for the potential for an event higher rating, as above, a maximum 50 percent rating is assigned for migraine headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  As noted during the August 2023 VA examination, the Veteran had lost less than one week of work the last 12 months due to his headaches. The Board finds that this does not rise to the level of severe economic inadaptability.

For the above reasons, the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of entitlement to a rating increase to 30 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's service-connected migraines. As the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 780-81. Accordingly, the Veteran's appeal is granted.
