ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of August 24, 2021, for the grant of service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) and ischemic heart disease, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Service connection for a heart disability was denied in a final January 2015 rating decision.

2. On August 24, 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ seeking to readjudicate the previously denied claim for service connection for a heart disability.

3. On August 27, 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction mailed the Veteran a letter indicating the application to readjudicate the claim for service connection for a heart disability was submitted on the incorrect claims form and providing instructions for submitting the correct Supplemental Claim form.

4. On October 18, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim application form seeking readjudication of his claim for service connection for a heart disability; this claim was granted in a September 2022 rating decision. 

5. The Veteran's August 24, 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ is construed as an incomplete application for benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (c) and he had one year from that date to submit the correct and complete VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim application form.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The January 2015 rating decision denying service connection for a heart disability is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 19.52, 20.1103.

2. The criteria for an effective date of August 24, 2021, but no earlier, for service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) and ischemic heart disease, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1971 to September 1974.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2024 rating decision. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal in August 2024 and elected the Direct Review docket.

The October 2023 decision on appeal is a Higher-Level Review decision. In June 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review that sought review of a September 2022 rating decision that had granted service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) and ischemic heart disease effective October 18, 2021. In reviewing a Higher-Level Review decision, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record when the underlying rating decision for which the Veteran requested higher-level review. As a result, this decision can only consider the evidence of record when September 2022 rating decision was issued on September 6, 2022. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

1. Entitlement to an effective date before October 18, 2021, for service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) and ischemic heart disease.

The Veteran seeks an effective date before October 18, 2021, for service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) and ischemic heart disease. The Veteran argues the effective date should be August 24, 2021, which was the date the Veteran submitted his most recent VA Form 21-526EZ application to reopen his claim for service connection for a heart disability.

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim, or a supplemental claim of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For Supplemental Claims received more than one year after the date on which the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the Supplemental Claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h)(2).

The Veteran filed an initial claim for service connection for a heart disability in May 2014. The claim was denied in a January 2015 rating decision, and the Veteran was notified of this decision in a letter dated January 14, 2015. The Veteran did not submit a timely Notice of Disagreement for the January 2015 denial, and the decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103.

The next communication VA received indicating the Veteran wished to have his claim for service connection for a heart disability reconsidered is a VA Form 21-526EZ application received on June 26, 2020. In a letter dated July 6, 2020, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction acknowledged receiving mail indicating the Veteran would like VA to review a claim that had previously been denied, and informing the Veteran that regulations required him to file this request on the proper form.

On August 24, 2021, VA received another VA Form 21-526EZ application from the Veteran seeking service connection for a heart disability. In a letter dated August 27, 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction again acknowledged receiving mail indicating the Veteran would like VA to review a claim that had previously been denied, and again informing the Veteran that regulations required him to file this request on the proper form. On October 18, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim seeking service connection for heart disease. This claim was ultimately granted in a September 2022 rating decision.

Typically, the effective date of an award based on a Supplemental Claim for compensation shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Here, that date is October 18, 2021, the current effective date. However, the Board has considered whether the August 24, 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ application can be construed as either an incomplete application or an intent to file a claim. Resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board construes the August 24, 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ application as an incomplete application seeking readjudication of the claim for service connection for a heart disability.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (c), upon receipt of a communication indicating a belief in entitlement to benefits that is submitted on a paper application form prescribed by the Secretary that is not complete, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form prescribed by the Secretary. If a complete claim is submitted within 1 year of receipt of such incomplete application form prescribed by the Secretary, VA will consider it as filed as of the date VA received the incomplete application form prescribed by the Secretary that did not meet the standards of a complete claim. 

VA received the VA Form 21-526EZ application on August 24, 2021. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction then notified the Veteran that he needed to file a complete application on the proper form in order for the previously denied claim for service connection for a heart disability to be readjudicated. The Veteran then filed the proper VA Form 21-0995, Supplemental Claim application on October 18, 2021, well within one year of the receipt of the VA Form 21-526EZ application. 

While the issue of whether an otherwise "complete" application submitted on the procedurally incorrect form can constitute an "incomplete application form" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (c) remains unresolved, in October 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims issued a nonprecedential single-judge memorandum decision suggesting that a claim filed on an incorrect form could constitute an "incomplete application form." In Conatser v. McDonough, No. 23-650, 2023 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1652 (decided October 26, 2023), the Court concluded that an otherwise complete VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim application was an incomplete claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (c), thus allowing the opportunity for correction within one year and to preserve the effective date as the date the incomplete application was received.

Although Conatser is a non-precedential single-judge decision, the decision is persuasive authority that supports finding an incorrect application form can constitute an incomplete application under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (c). Single judge memorandum decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain. Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992). In Conatser, the correct form the Veteran needed to file was the VA Form 21-526EZ; the Veteran had instead submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim form, which the Court determined was an incomplete application under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (c). Here, the Board is presented with the reverse situation. If a Supplemental Claim can be considered an incomplete application form when a VA Form 21-526EZ was required, then logically a VA Form 21-526EZ could be considered an incomplete application where a Supplemental Claim was required. 

Considering the foregoing, the Board finds the Veteran's August 24, 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ constituted an incomplete application seeking readjudication of his claim for service connection for a heart disability. As such, the Veteran's application to reopen and readjudicate his claim for service connection for a heart disability is considered to have been filed on August 18, 2021, the date VA received the incomplete application form. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400. Entitlement to an effective date of August 18, 2021, for service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) and ischemic heart disease, is warranted. 

In addition, the Veteran's August 24, 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ application is analogous to an intent to file a claim. A claimant can indicate his desire to file a claim for VA benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. 

If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). The regulation then provides that an intent to file a claim can be submitted in one of the following three ways: (i) an application electronically initiated and saved in a claims-submission tool within a VA web-based electronic claims application system prior to filing of a complete claim; (ii) a written intent to file on the form prescribed by the Secretary for that purpose; or (iii) an oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel and recorded in writing. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b)(1).

A completed and submitted VA Form 21-526EZ application form is not listed in the regulation as a type of "intent to file a claim" in 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). However, it is clear by the content of the Veteran's August 24, 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ that he intended to seek readjudication of his previously denied claim for service connection for a heart disability. VA then notified the Veteran that the claim was received on the incorrect form, and he was provided adequate notice that the claim must be refiled utilizing the VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim application form, which was subsequently received on October 18, 2021. The regulation does not state that an intent to file a claim must be submitted in one of the three listed ways and does not explicitly disallow any other type of intent to file. Rather, 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b)(1) states an intent to file "can" be submitted in one of the listed ways. The language used is more permissive than such language as "shall" or "must," and suggests a Veteran can also submit an intent to file a claim in another manner. However, an effective date before August 24, 2021 is not warranted. The Veteran's initial claim for service connection for a heart disability was denied in the rating decision issued on January 14, 2015. The Veteran did not submit a timely Notice of Disagreement to this decision, and new and material evidence was not received within one year. The January 14, 2015 decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103.

Much of the same analysis applicable to the August 24, 2021 application also applies to the Veteran's earlier VA Form 21-526EZ application received on June 26, 2020, which also sought to reopen the claim for service connection for a heart disability. This application can also be construed as an incomplete application under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (c), and clearly expressed the Veteran's intent to have his claim for service connection for a heart disability readjudicated. To preserve June 26, 2020 as the date of the claim, 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 would have required the Veteran submit the correct completed application form within one year. Instead, the Veteran submitted the appropriate VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim in October 2021, over one year later. The Board also notes the August 24, 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ application was received over one year after the June 26, 2020 application, as well as over one year after the July 6, 2020 letter was mailed informing the Veteran that he had to file the claim on the proper form.

The Veteran has not alleged, and the evidence does not show, that the Veteran filed any other application seeking service connection for a heart disability other than those identified above. Consequently, under the applicable regulations and statutes, the earliest possible effective date for the grant of service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) and ischemic heart disease is August 24, 2021. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.
