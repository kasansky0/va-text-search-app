ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the appeal period, the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's blood pressure readings were indicative of a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or a history of diastolic pressure predominately 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial compensable disability rating for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, DC 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1971 to January 1975. 

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 2023 rating decision. In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the initial rating decision. 

In his timely filed August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that the AOJ requested the Veteran submit any relevant private treatment records or submit information with which VA can assist the Veteran in obtaining private treatment records. Required notice and information were provided in the claim form which the Veteran signed, certifying to the fact that such notice was received and further than they have included or identified relevant evidence. VA requested records for which the Veteran submitted a proper release and/or adequately identified. The duty to assist is not a one-way street. If the Veteran desires help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining evidence. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991). Thus, the Board finds that VA has satisfied the duty to assist. No further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in development. Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).

The standard set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) only permits constructive receipt of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records that not only existed prior to the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal, but also for which the claimant furnished sufficient information to make the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) aware of the existence of those records. Thus, the Board's consideration of VHA records is limited to the same.  Here, the Board finds that VA treatment records were obtained and reviewed consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) and the AMA framework.

38 C.F.R. § 3.103 provides that a Veteran, upon request, is entitled to a hearing prior to VA's adjudication of an initial or supplemental claim.  The Board observes that notice regarding the opportunity for a hearing at the AOJ was not provided in this case. In Bowen, the Court found that there was no due process violation in the denial of the Veteran's requested hearing before the AOJ because the Veteran had subsequently been offered the opportunity to have a hearing before the Board. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253 (2012). Here, the Veteran was offered a choice of three dockets in the AMA framework to include the Board hearing docket. Although the issue in Bowen was not one of notice, the Board cannot discern a basis to find that the underlying holding and logic of Bowen would not lead to the same finding of a lack of prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.

Increased Rating Claims

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Rating Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered because of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. §1155; 38 C.F.R. §4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. §4.7.

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension associated with herbicide exposure is denied.

The Veteran generally contends that his hypertension is more severe than reflected by the assigned rating. He seeks an increase. As an initial matter the Veteran filed an original claim seeking service connection for hypertension on August 1, 2023, which was granted with an effective date of August 1, 2022. 

Legal Criteria

Hypertension is rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension). Under DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. A 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.

Under Diagnostic Code 7101, a Veteran is entitled to a minimum compensable rating for hypertension when there is a "history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more [that] requires continuous medication for control." 38 C.F.R. §4.104. In Wilson v. McDonough, the Court concluded that "a history of diastolic pressure predominately 100 or more [that] requires continuous medication for control" specifically refers to blood pressure readings taken before a Veteran began medication to control hypertension, and therefore may require analyzing blood pressure readings prior to the period on appeal, to include blood pressure readings contained in the service treatment records. 35 Vet. App. 75, 80 (2021).

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria. Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common." See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

Additionally, in rating hypertension under Diagnostic Code 7101, the Board may consider blood pressure readings taken while a Veteran is using medication. McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) (holding that Diagnostic Code 7101 contemplates the effects of medication and therefore Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012), does not apply.)

Factual Background

The Veteran was afforded an in - person VA Hypertension examination in September 2023. The examiner noted that medical records showed that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension in 2017. The Veteran reported his condition began in 2005. His treatment plan included taking continuous prescribed Lisinopril, a medication for hypertension. Based on a review of medical records and an examination interview, the examiner concluded that the Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more. The examiner noted blood pressure readings of 159/83, 149/96, and 157/93 on the date of the September 2023 examination.

Blood pressure readings documented in the Veteran's medical records demonstrate readings lower than the September 2023 VA examination. Specifically, in VA treatment records dated November 2007 the blood pressure reading was 121/76, September 2008 the blood pressure reading was 110/76, March 2009 the blood pressure reading was 135/82, December 2009 the blood pressure reading was 122/76, February 2010 the Veteran reported home blood pressure reading of 112/65, April 2010 the Veteran reported home blood pressure readings of 110s-120s/60s-70s, April 2018 the blood pressure reading was 137/86, February 2019 the blood pressure reading was 121/84, May 2019 the blood pressure reading was 134/82, May 2020 the blood pressure reading was 132/79, and in July 2023 the blood pressure reading was 129/76.

Merits

After considering the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against a compensable rating for hypertension throughout the duration of the appeal period. Although the evidence reflects that continuous medication has been required for hypertensive control, the September 2023 VA examiner found that the evidence did not show a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more. The Board accords that opinion high probative value because it was proffered after a review of the Veteran's medical records and an interview and in person examination of the Veteran. The Board further finds it is consistent with both the VA and private treatment records contained within the Veteran's claims file.

Further, during the appeal period, the medical evidence does not show diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101.

In reaching its conclusion that the Veteran's blood pressure readings were not indicative of a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or a history of diastolic pressure predominately 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control, the Board has applied the word's common meaning of "for the most part" or "mainly." See Predominantly definition, Merriam-Webster.com, available at https://www. Merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominantly (last visited November 30, 2023).

The Board has also considered the Veteran's statements. The Board finds that although the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms he experienced through his senses, he is not competent to identify a specific level of disability according to the appropriate diagnostic codes. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). The Veteran has not shown he possesses medical expertise. The medical findings, as provided in the examination report, directly address the criteria under which his disability is rated. The Board finds that evidence is the most persuasive and outweighs any lay statements in support of his claim for a higher rating.

Accordingly, the Board finds that an initial compensable rating for hypertension is not warranted.
