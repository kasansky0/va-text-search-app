ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from December 1990 to May 1991, from June 1991 to May 1992, and from December 1992 to October 1997.

In July 2024, the Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision which addressed the above-noted issue.  Thereafter, in August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), wherein he sought to appeal the claim in the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) System.  He selected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the RO issued the July 2024 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's OSA was caused by his service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Obstructive sleep apnea is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

Duty to Assist

As explained below, the Board has determined the evidence currently of record is sufficient to grant entitlement to service connection for OSA.  Therefore, no further development is required under 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A or 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be granted for disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a).

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran seeks service connection for OSA, which he contends was caused by a service-connected disability.

In March 2024, the RO obtained a VA medical opinion addressing this matter.  In sum, the examiner concluded the Veteran's PTSD less likely than not caused his OSA.  The examiner further stated the Veteran's obesity was the primary risk factor/cause of his sleep apnea.  Here, the Board notes VA General Counsel Opinion 1-2017, which holds that obesity may be an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service connected on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a).  See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017 (Jan. 6, 2017).  The examiner failed to explain whether the Veteran's obesity, which he concluded was the most likely direct cause of his OSA, may have been consequentially related to his service-connected PTSD.

However, in a May 2017 primary care treatment note, the Veteran's treating physician indicated his alcohol use was the significant contributing factor to his weight gain.  The clinician noted the Veteran's use of diet and exercise, but advised him that he should cut back on his use of alcohol.  Further, an August 2017 VA PTSD examination chronicled the Veteran's nightly consumption of alcohol, which the examiner found was a means of self-medication to blot out memories and help him sleep.  

In sum, the evidence indicates the Veteran's daily use of alcohol has contributed substantially to his weight gain, and is a means of self-medicating his PTSD.  In turn, the Veteran's weight gain has been deemed the main risk factor in the development of his OSA.  Accordingly, service connection is warranted for OSA, as the disability has been shown to be consequentially related to a service-connected disability.
