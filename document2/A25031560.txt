DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

An effective date of August 19, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of a 70 percent rating for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record shows that it was factually ascertainable that the Veteran experienced an increase in his PTSD symptoms as of August 19, 2021, within one year prior to his seeking an increased rating for this disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of August 19, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of a 70 percent rating for PTSD are met. 38 U.S.C.§ 5110; §§ 3.102, 3.400(o), DC 9411.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from June 1979 to February 1987 and November 1990 to July 1991, with Reserve service and service in in Southwest Asia. This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 Higher-Level Review rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). The Veteran timely appealed, submitting a VA Form 10182 in July 2024 and selecting the Direct Review docket. In the Direct Review docket, the Board reviews the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decision on appeal for each issue, although the Board notes, that in this particular case, the rating decision on appeal noted that the evidentiary record closed as of the date of its prior decision, or May 2022, and the Board abides by that same date. Accordingly, no additional evidence after the May 2022 rating decision may be considered. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

An effective date of August 19, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of a 70 percent rating for PTSD is granted.

In a May 2022 rating decision, the Veteran's service-connected PTSD was increased to 70 percent disabling, effective April 8, 2022, the date the Veteran's increased rating claim was received. In his July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran's attorney requested an effective date of August 19, 2021, as that it the date it became factually ascertainable that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms worsened. 

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the day following separation from active service or date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). An initial claim includes a new claim requesting service connection and a claim for increase in a disability evaluation rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). 

When a claim for an increased rating is granted, the effective date assigned may be up to one year prior to the date that the application for increase was received if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred in that timeframe. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet.App. 505, 509 (2007)

The Board finds that an effective date of August 19, 2021, but no earlier, is warranted for a 70 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD. The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, but only if the claim for an increase is received within one year from such date. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). 

In this case, the Board finds that it is first factually ascertainable in the record that the criteria for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for PTSD had been met on August 19, 2021, within one year prior to the receipt of the Veteran's claim for an increased rating.

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders ("General Formula"), under which the Veteran's PTSD is rated, the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A 50 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

In this case, the evidence shows the Veteran reported during VA outpatient treatment in August 2021 and February 2022, that his PTSD symptoms increased within the past several months, within one year that the Veteran's increased rating claim was received. There he reported he wakes up 2 or more time a night drenched in sweat, has nightmares, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, suffers from social withdrawal, has depressed mood, generalized anxiety, difficulty concentrating, poor attention span, insomnia, irritability, and night sweats. The May 2022 VA examination findings were consistent with an increased (70 percent) rating for the Veteran's PTSD. Thus, the Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt on this issue and finds that it is factually ascertainable in the record that his PTSD increased in severity on August 19, 2021 (prior to the May 2022 VA examination) and the Veteran's claim is GRANTED.
