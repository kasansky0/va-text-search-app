CONCLUSION OF LAW

As the benefits sought on appeal have been satisfied, there remains no case or controversy as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for alopecia areata. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1973 to March 1977, December 1990 to March 1991, May 1999 to July 1999, and September 2001 to August 2002.

1. Entitlement to service connection for alopecia areata is dismissed.

Historically, in February 2022, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim seeking service connection for a skin disease. In May 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision, denying the Veteran's claim.

In August 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2022 decision.  In September 2022, the AOJ issued an HLR decision denying the claim of service connection for alopecia areata. In October 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, appealing the September 2022 rating decision. 

In November 2022, the Veteran submitted an additional VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2022 decision. In a February 2023 rating decision, the AOJ identified a duty to assist error in the May 2022 rating decision.

In a July 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim of service connection for alopecia areata. 

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted an additional VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the July 2023 decision. In a September 2023 rating decision, the AOJ identified a duty to assist error during the HLR. The Veteran's claim of service connection was denied in a July 2024 rating decision. 

In July 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, appealing the July 2024 rating decision.

In a November 2024 Board decision, the Board granted the Veteran's claim of service connection for alopecia areata. This decision was implemented in a November 2024 rating decision. A November 2024 rating decision effectuated the Board decision and if the Veteran chooses to protested the rating or effective date assigned, he should consult the appeal rights sent with notice of that decision.

As such, because service connection was granted for the Veteran's alopecia areata, there remains no case or controversy regarding the appeal for service connection; the appeal as to that issue is dismissed.
