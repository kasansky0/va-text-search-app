CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

2. With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. ?38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 5107;?38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2017 to October 2021.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from August 2023 and October 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decisions.  In the August 2023 rating decision, the RO confirmed and continued its previous denial of service connection for tinnitus.  In the October 2023 rating decision, the RO confirmed and continued its previous denial of service connection for anxiety condition, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, with respect to the tinnitus claim, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, and with respect to the anxiety claim, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As an initial matter, pursuant to Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009), given the multiple psychiatric symptoms and psychiatric claims in this case, the Board has recharacterized the anxiety claim more broadly as a claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder.

Additionally, in his July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran has requested the appeal of claims from February 2023 and March 2023 rating decisions.  Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, an appeal to the Board must be initiated by the filing of a NOD in the form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  The NOD must be in writing and identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).  The term issue means an adjudication of a specific entitlement as described in 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(c).  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).  Except as provided in the case of simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed NOD with a decision by the AOJ within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).  In the present case, the VA Form 10182 was not timely received as to the following issues: acne, left shoulder and sleep disturbance, as the NOD was received more than a year after the rating decision was issued with respect to those claims.  Accordingly, the Board finds that these issues are not properly before the Board at this time.  

Lastly, under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the modernized review system, a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or issue by filing a supplemental claim at any time following notice of a decision by the Agency of Original Adjudication (AOJ) or the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  Here, the Veteran submitted his original service connection claims for tinnitus and an acquired psychiatric disorder on August 29, 2022.  The Board finds the Veteran has continuously pursued such claims for service connection since that time.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  Accordingly, the appeal period dates back to August 29, 2022.

Service Connection 

Service connection may be granted when the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, or air service. ?38?U.S.C. §?1110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two. Saunders v. Wilkie,?886 F.3d 1356, 1361?(Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d). 

Under?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(b), an alternative method of establishing the second and third element is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology if the disability claimed qualifies as a chronic disease listed in?38?C.F.R. §?3.309(a); sensorineural hearing loss is a qualifying chronic disease.  See Walker v. Shinseki,?708 F.3d 1331?(Fed. Cir. 2013). 

A Veteran's lay statements may be competent to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.?38?C.F.R. §§?3.303(a), 3.159(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson,?492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77?(Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson,?451 F.3d 1331?(Fed. Cir. 2006).  Decreased hearing acuity is the type of symptom or disability capable of observation by a lay person. See also Davidson v. Shinseki,?581 F.3d 1313?(2009) (noting that a layperson may comment on lay-observable symptoms). 

A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology.  See?38?C.F.R. §?3.159(a); Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 470?(1994).  "Symptoms, not treatment, are the essence of any evidence of continuity of symptomatology."  Savage v. Gober,?10?Vet. App.?488, 496?(1997) (citing Wilson v. Derwinski,?2?Vet. App.?16, 19?(1991)). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Acquired Psychiatric Disorder 

The Veteran contends that his acquired psychiatric disorder is related to active-duty service.  Specifically, the Veteran came to the defense of others in July 2018, thereby risking his life in a fray with a fellow service member and the event has left a significant impact on his mental health since that time.  See Statement in Support of Claim, received March 29, 2023. 

For the following reasons, the Board finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is warranted.

According to the June 2023 VA psychiatric exam, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder (unspecified trauma and stressor-related disorder).  See C&P Exam, June 2023.  

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show no sign of mental health issues at the time of his entry into service.  See STR - Medical (December 1965 Report of Medical Examination).  

With respect to a nexus, the Veteran submitted a March 2023 private opinion from C.W. in which, upon review of the evidence, the clinician found substantial evidence in support of a compensable mental health condition.  See Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility, received March 29, 2023.   

The Board acknowledges the medical opinions of the June 2023 and August 2023 VA examiners but assigns minimal probative value as the examiners failed to address the substance of the positive medical opinion from C.W.  Additionally, the VA examiners failed to consider competent and credible evidence of the Veteran's report of the onset of his psychiatric symptoms in service.  Accordingly, the Board affords little probative value to these opinions.  

Of greater probative value is the medical opinion from C.W.  Notably, the opinion is supported by the evidence of record.  The opinion was completed by a trained medical professional who reviewed the record and formed an opinion particular to this Veteran.  

Based on the foregoing, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder is related to active-duty service.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Tinnitus

The Veteran asserts his current tinnitus is the result of in-service noise exposure.  See August 2022 Fully Developed Claim.

A current diagnosis and in-service injury are not at issue.  In a February 2023 rating decision, the RO conceded noise exposure and a current diagnosis of tinnitus.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  Therefore, the question before the Board is whether the Veteran's current tinnitus is related to his conceded in-service noise exposure.  

The Veteran is competent to report the onset and persistent nature of his tinnitus symptoms.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology that is not medical in nature); Charles v. Principi,16 Vet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002) (holding that particularly with respect to claims for tinnitus, a veteran is competent to present evidence of a diagnosis and continuous symptoms).

Additionally, the Veteran submitted a March 2023 private medical opinion in which, upon review of the entire claims file, the clinician M.B. concluded the Veteran's tinnitus is at least as likely as not due to and/or related to military acoustic trauma during active-duty military service.  See Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility, received March 29, 2023.   

The Board acknowledges the negative opinion of the September 2022 and June 2023 VA examiners.  However, the examiners rely on the absence of in-service complaints or treatment related to the Veteran's tinnitus which is not the applicable standard for service connection.  Therefore, the opinions are of less probative value.  See Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 179 (2005) (a VA examination must be based on an accurate factual premise).

The Veteran has consistently reported throughout the appeal period that he has experienced recurrent tinnitus since active service.  Based on the Veteran's consistent reporting of symptoms, particularly in light of the nexus opinion of the March 2023 private clinician, the medical and lay evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's tinnitus disability has been linked to his service.  The evidence is therefore at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to service.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
