ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus had its onset during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2004 to October 2008. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that considered the evidence of record on that date.  In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 requesting Direct Review as the review option. Based on the Veteran's election, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Any additional evidence associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed has not been considered. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent medical or lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

For the chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), including tinnitus, service connection may alternatively be established with evidence of chronicity of the disease during service or during a presumptive period following service separation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015). For conditions noted during service (or in the presumptive period) but not shown to be chronic at the time, a continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). When chronicity or continuity is established, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, no matter how remote in time from the period of service, will be service connected unless clearly attributable to causes unrelated to service ("intercurrent" causes). Id.

In addition, where a veteran served continuously for 90 days or more during a period of war, or after December 31, 1946, there is a presumption of service connection for organic disease of the nervous system, including tinnitus, if the disease manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service, even if there is no evidence of the disease during the service period itself. 38 U.S.C. § § 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). This presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d).

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance-which includes but is not limited to equipoise-the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021). If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt-rule does not apply. Id. at 781-82.

The Veteran maintains that he suffers from tinnitus that is related to active service. See February 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. He stated that he first experienced tinnitus in 2007 after being exposed to explosions, gunfire, and grenade launchers during active duty. See March 2022 VA Examination. The AOJ has found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus, and that he was exposed to hazardous noise during service as a Mobile Multichannel Equipment Operator in the Marines. See VA Rating Decisions, dated May 17, 2022, and March 10, 2023.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Board notes that, while the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim in the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, it did not specifically reverse the prior favorable finding as to a current disability based upon clear and unmistakable error.  Therefore, the first and second elements of service connection have been met, and the only remaining issue is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's diagnosed tinnitus and his active service. 

As noted above, the Veteran stated that he first experienced tinnitus in active service in 2007. See March 2022 VA Examination. He reported that he was exposed to explosions, gunfire, and grenade launchers. At a July 2009 VA consultation for polytrauma and traumatic brain injury (TBI), the Veteran reported that he was exposed to two blasts during active service, in February 2007 and December 2007. In the December 2007 blast, he was about 200-300 yards away from an IED when it exploded. He stated that he had a temporary loss of hearing. At the July 2009 VA visit, the Veteran reported occasional tinnitus. At an August 2009 audiology consult, he reported that he first noted hearing loss in his third year in the Marines, and that he hears noises in his ears, to include high pitched ringing.  By way of his representative, the Veteran stated that his tinnitus began in service and has continued since. See April 2024 VA Form 10182. 

The Veteran has asserted in statements throughout the pendency of the claim that he experienced a continued progression of auditory symptoms, specifically tinnitus, since his separation from active service. See Hensley, 5 Vet. App. at 159-160 (holding that, when audiometric test results do not meet the regularity requirements for establishing a "disability" at the time of the Veteran's separation, the Veteran may nevertheless establish service connection for a current hearing disability by submitting competent evidence that the current disability is causally related to service). In this regard, the Veteran is competent to report experiencing auditory symptomatology since his active service, as symptoms such as tinnitus are certainly conditions with "unique and readily identifiable features" that are "capable of lay observation." Jandreau, 492 F. 3d at 1376-77; Davidson, 581 F.3d 1313; Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002); see also Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 309. Additionally, the Veteran is credible in his report of suffering auditory symptomatology during service. See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. at 711, aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (table) (holding that, in determining whether statements submitted by or on behalf of a claimant are credible, the Board may consider their internal consistency, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the claimant). This credible report of a continuity of symptomatology suggests a link between his current tinnitus and service. See Duenas v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 512 (2004). 

Given the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements that he has suffered from tinnitus since service and his documented treatment for tinnitus symptoms less than one year after separating from service, the Board finds that the Veteran's current tinnitus is related to service. 

The Board notes that there is a negative etiological opinion of record in the form of the March 2022 VA examination report. The examiner opined it was less likely than not that the Veteran's tinnitus was related to his military service. The VA examiner's rationale was based primarily on the absence of complaints of tinnitus in the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs), as well as his post-service noise exposure. The Board notes that documented in-service treatment is not required to establish serviced connection. See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992) (finding that the lack of documented hearing loss while in service is not fatal to a claim for service connection). Furthermore, the examiner did not consider the Veteran's competent and credible statements concerning a continuity of tinnitus symptoms since service. Finally, the examiner did not give any explanation as to why the Veteran's post-service noise exposure makes it less likely that his tinnitus is related to his conceded in-service noise exposure. Indeed, as noted above, the Veteran sought treatment for tinnitus symptoms less than a year after separating from service. 

In sum, the Veteran has competently and credibly described suffering in-service noise exposure and reported a continuity of symptomatology of bilateral auditory pathology in the form of tinnitus during and since his active service. See Charles, 16 Vet. App. 370; Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see also Jefferson v. Principi, 271 F.3d 1072 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In light of the Veteran's statements, service connection is warranted for tinnitus.
