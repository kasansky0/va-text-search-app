ISSUES

1. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder with persistent depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder, and gambling disorder (PTSD).

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 26, 2022 for total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU).

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 26, 2022 for eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 (DEA).  

ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD is denied.  

Entitlement to an effective date of October 13, 2017, but no earlier, for TDIU is granted.   

Entitlement to an effective date of October 13, 2017, but no earlier, for eligibility to DEA is granted.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The frequency, severity, and duration of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms have more closely approximated occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas. Total occupational and social impairment has not been shown. 

2. Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, from October 13, 2017 his service-connected disability rendered him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his education and work history.

3. The Veteran is herein granted an effective date of October 13, 2017 for entitlement to TDIU, and the service-connected disability upon which this grant is based is permanent in nature and is reasonably certain to continue throughout the Veteran's lifetime.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD have not been met or approximated. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

2. The criteria for entitlement to TDIU from October 13, 2017, but no earlier, have been met or approximated. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. 

3. The criteria for eligibility to DEA from October 13, 2017, but no earlier, under   38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1981 to May 1989 and from July 1991 to April 1992, with additional National Guard service.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

By way of background, following a May 2016 rating decision denying service connection for PTSD and an October 2017 Intent to File, the Veteran filed a May 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ again seeking service connection for PTSD. A July 2018 rating decision denied the PTSD claim as evidence submitted was not new and material. After a January 2019 Notice of Disagreement (Decision Review Officer (DRO) Review Process), in a March 2020 rating decision the RO granted service connection for PTSD with a 70 percent disability rating, effective October 13, 2017 (intent to file date). The Veteran then submitted a February 2021 VA Form 20-0996 Higher-Level Review (HLR) request regarding both the disability rating and effective date for service-connected PTSD, as well as entitlement to TDIU. 

Following a May 2021 HLR rating decision, in April 2022 the Veteran filed both VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim for entitlement to an increased disability rating and earlier effective date for PTSD and entitlement to TDIU, and VA Form 21-8940 Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability (VA Form 8940). A January 2023 supplemental claim rating decision continued the PTSD disability rating at 70 percent and effective date of October 13, 2017, and granted entitlement to TDIU and DEA effective April 26, 2022, the date VA received the Supplemental Claim/VA Form 8940.  

Following a February 2023 HLR request and an April 2023 rating decision, the Veteran properly submitted a March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) appealing the disability rating of PTSD and the effective date of TDIU and DEA, and selected the direct review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 supplemental claim rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the January 2023 rating decision cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD.

The Veteran claims entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 70 percent for his service-connected PTSD. He contends that a 100 percent disability rating is warranted. See March 2024 Third Party Correspondence. 

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Board should consider only those factors contained in the rating criteria. See Massey v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 204 (1994).

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Board will also consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Nevertheless, where the evidence contains factual findings that show a change in the severity of symptoms during the course of the rating period on appeal, assignment of staged ratings would be permissible. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411, a 70 percent disability rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

A 100 percent disability rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

When evaluating a mental disorder, the rating agency shall consider the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission. The rating agency shall assign a rating based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination. When evaluating the level of disability from a mental disorder, the rating agency will consider the extent of social impairment but shall not assign a rating solely on the basis of social impairment. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126.

In evaluating the evidence in any given appeal, it is the responsibility of the Board to weigh the evidence and decide where to give credit and where to withhold the same and, in so doing, accept certain medical opinions over others. Schoolman v. West, 12 Vet. App. 307, 310-11 (1999). In this regard, the Board has been charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F. 3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Indeed, the Court has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to do so. Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 488-89 (2000). In doing so, the Board is free to favor one medical opinion over another, provided it offers an adequate basis for doing so. See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995).

Over the course of this appeal there have been several VA mental health examinations as well as CAPRI and private medical notations regarding the Veteran's PTSD. As will be discussed below, the Board finds the February 2020 and June 2022 VA mental health examinations generally reflective of the overall evidence of record, and illustrative of the Veteran's full disability picture throughout the appeal period. 

To that end, in the February 2020 VA mental health examination, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD (chronic, severe), persistent depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder (severe), tobacco use disorder (severe), and gambling disorder. Symptoms noted include depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attack more than once a week, near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impairment of short and long-term memory, flattened affect, circumstantial, circumlocutory or stereotyped speech, disturbances of motivation and mood, inability/difficulty in establishing relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, obsessional rituals, and impaired impulse control. Additionally, the Veteran denied suicidal/homicidal ideation, plans, intent, and means. 

The examiner noted that the Veteran's symptoms resulted in moderate to severe levels of difficulty in his personal, social, and occupational functioning, with severe difficulties in joining community activities, dealing with people he didn't know, and maintaining friendships. The examiner also noted that the Veteran was not married, had no children, and lived alone, with a noted history of relationships all negatively impacted by PTSD-related symptoms. The Veteran also had a history of legal issues including incarceration for theft and embezzlement and several driving while intoxicated (DWI) offenses. He also experienced homelessness but was currently living in VA-supported housing and worked at VA part-time in a vocational rehabilitation program, but reported difficulties with excessive leave due to needing frequent "mental health days".

Ultimately, the examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms caused occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and/or mood. 

In the June 2022 VA mental health examination, the examiner also diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD (severe), persistent depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder (severe in early remission), tobacco use disorder (severe), and gambling disorder, while describing the same symptoms as noted above. Additionally, the Veteran denied any past or current suicidal or homicidal ideation, intention, or plan. 

The June 2022 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms resulted in  occupational and social functional limitations including severely impaired cognitive functioning, mood and motivation, a lack of friendships, poor self-care, and an inability to respond appropriately in work relationships. The examiner noted  that these limitations were shown by the Veteran's inability to sustain gainful employment, including as examples that the Veteran, due to difficulties with colleagues and bosses, had been fired from several previous positions, was currently unemployed, quitting his last job due to a conflict with his boss, and that he was unable to complete the VA rapid education program due to concentration problems. 

Ultimately, the examiner also opined that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms caused occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and/or mood. 

The Board affords both the February 2020 and June 2022 VA examinations strong probative value as the examiners appear to have reviewed the entire record as appropriate, noted and contemplated the Veteran's medical history and statements, and provided an assessment of the Veteran's overall level of functioning, in light of the symptoms reported by the Veteran.

After full consideration of all the evidence of record, including the probative evidence noted above, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms mostly approximate the criteria for the already assigned 70 percent disability rating, that is, that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms caused occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas during the appeal period.

As noted, when assigning a rating, the Board must consider the frequency, severity and duration of the Veteran's symptoms. And although the evidence demonstrates a significant and severe degree of occupational and social impairment due to the Veteran's PTSD symptoms, it does not show total occupational and total social impairment due to, in particular, such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication, grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent danger of hurting self or others, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, disorientation to time or place, or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Importantly, the Board also notes that the Veteran has repeatedly denied suicidal or homicidal ideation or plan, and it also appears that he has not had legal issues or troubles as had been the case in the past.    

The Board is sympathetic to the impact of PTSD on the Veteran's life and in no way means to downplay the Veteran's struggles, but emphasizes again that during the appeal period, the probative evidence of record discussed above simply does not meet the relevant, specific VA rating criteria for a higher disability rating.   

In sum, the evidence does not demonstrate symptoms or impact which are more consistent with the 100 percent disability rating, but rather are more in line with the current 70 percent disability rating. Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence for an increased disability rating, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the appeal must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 4.130; Lynch v. McDonough,  21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 26, 2022 for TDIU. 

The Veteran claims entitlement to TDIU prior to April 26, 2022. He contends specifically that his TDIU request was not a new claim but part and parcel of his continuously pursued claim for an increased rating for PTSD, and that because he was unable to maintain and secure substantially gainful employment at least from October 13, 2017, the date he was service-connected for PTSD with a disability rating of 70 percent, he is entitled to TDIU from that same date. See March 2024 Third Party Correspondence.

As an initial matter, the Board incorporates its discussion from the section above by reference and as appropriate. 

Additionally, the Board finds that pursuant to Rice, the issue of entitlement to TDIU was raised in connection with, and is part and parcel of, the underlying claim for an increased disability rating for PTSD. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Thus, the TDIU appeal period begins October 13, 2017, the initial date of claim and effective date for service connection for PTSD. Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

Relevant here, and as noted above, the Veteran's PTSD is rated at 70 percent disabling, effective October 13, 2017. Because the Veteran has a single disability rated at 60 percent or more, he meets the schedular criteria for TDIU from October 13, 2017. 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(a).

The question here, then, is whether and when the Veteran's service-connected disability rendered him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation and thus entitled to TDIU, prior to April 26, 2022 and specifically no earlier than October 13, 2017, within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  

Regulations provide that TDIU is warranted when the evidence shows that the Veteran is precluded from obtaining or maintaining substantially gainful employment by reason of his/her service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. VA defines substantially gainful employment as "employment at which non-disabled individuals earn their livelihood with earnings comparable to the particular occupation in the community where the [Veteran] resides." See M21-1, Part IV, Subpart ii, Chapter 2(F)(1)(c). Consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience when arriving at this conclusion, but factors such as age or impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities are not to be considered. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The term unemployability is not synonymous with the terms unemployed and unemployable for the purposes of determining entitlement to TDIU. A Veteran may be unemployed or unemployable for a variety of reasons, but a determination as to entitlement to TDIU is appropriate only when a Veteran's unemployability is the result of a service-connected disability. See M21-1, Part IV, Subpart ii, Chapter 2(F)(1)(b). When there are multiple service-connected disabilities, the Board must assess the cumulative effects of those disabilities and determine whether, combined, they preclude substantially gainful employment. See Floore v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 376, 382 (2013).

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" has been interpreted to consist of two components: one economic and one noneconomic. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 72-74 (2019).  

The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce's poverty threshold for one person. Id. at 73.

With respect to the noneconomic component, when determining whether a Veteran can secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, consideration should be given to the following: (1) the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training; (2) whether the Veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities required; and, (3) whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue. Id. at 73-74. 

The Economic Component of Securing and Following a Substantially Gainful Occupation

In regard to the Veteran's yearly income, social security records and submitted VA Form 8940 show the Veteran earned no income from 2013 to 2017, $1,759 in 2018, and in 2019-2020 approximately just over $5,000. In sum, during the appeal period, and in fact well before, the Veteran either did not work or his income was well below the poverty threshold for a single individual.

As such, the Board finds that in regard to the economic component, the Veteran was unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation from October 13, 2017.  

The Noneconomic Component of Securing and Following a Substantially Gainful Occupation

While on active duty, the Veteran's military occupational specialties (MOS) included veterinary services food inspector and administrative specialist, while in the National Guard he was a senior mechanic. His formal education included two years of college. He stated that in recent years he worked in various jobs for short periods of time, often through VA's vocational rehabilitation program, most recently as a school crossing guard, or was otherwise unemployed. Over two decades ago he worked as an accounting clerk/bookkeeper. See DD-214; April 2022 VA Form 8940.

As noted, the February 2020 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms resulted in moderate to severe levels of difficulty in his personal, social, and occupational functioning, and noted that even while working part-time he reported difficulties with excessive leave due to needing frequent "mental health days". 

In a similar vein, the June 2022 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms and limitations thereof, were manifested by the Veteran's inability to sustain gainful employment, including as examples, that the Veteran, due to difficulties with colleagues and bosses, had been fired from several previous positions, quit his last job and was currently unemployed, and was unable to complete the VA rapid education program due to concentration problems. 

The Board finds the above VA medical opinions to be highly probative as to the Veteran's inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. The record clearly highlights the Veteran's PTSD symptom-driven difficulties in even part-time program-assisted jobs over many years. To that point, the Board is hard-pressed to identify a substantially gainful position the Veteran could complete satisfactorily without many accommodations, given his service-connected PTSD symptoms and limitations, including but not limited to his manifest difficulties with concentration and interacting to any degree whatsoever with colleagues, co-workers, and bosses. 

As such, the Board finds that regarding the noneconomic component, considering the Veteran's education, skill, and training, his PTSD symptoms and limitations rendered him unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation from October 13, 2017.  

In conclusion, then, taking into account the Veteran's struggling occupational experience over many years as a result of his PTSD symptoms and limitations, the Board finds that the evidence summarized above is at least in approximate balance that from October 13, 2017, but no earlier, the Veteran's service-connected PTSD symptoms rendered him, in the whole, in both the economic and noneconomic components, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his education and work history. Therefore, affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, entitlement to TDIU from October 13, 2017, but no earlier, is granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 26, 2022 for eligibility to DEA. 

The Veteran claims entitlement to eligibility to DEA prior to April 26, 2022, and specifically from the effective date of his service-connected PTSD and here-in granted TDIU, October 13, 2017. See March 2024 Third Party Correspondence.

As an initial matter, the Board incorporates its discussion from the sections above by reference and as appropriate. 

Basic eligibility for DEA benefits under Chapter 35 exists if a Veteran has a service-connected total disability that is permanent in nature. 38 U.S.C. § 3501, C.F.R. § 3.807. A total disability may be assigned where a Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities are rated 100 percent disabling under the Rating Schedule, or if a Veteran is unemployable due to his service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341.

As decided herein, entitlement to TDIU was granted from October 13, 2017 because the Veteran's service-connected PTSD rendered him unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his education, background and employment history. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran meets the basic eligibility requirements for DEA benefits from that same date, October 13, 2017. As such, entitlement to an effective date of October 13, 2017 for eligibility to DEA is granted.
