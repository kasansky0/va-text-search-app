ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with constipation associated with thoracolumbar strain, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

1. The Veteran was diagnosed with GERD in 2017.

2. On February 10, 2022, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received the Veteran's supplemental claim to reopen service connection for GERD.

3. The Veteran's previous claims for GERD were not continuously pursued and became final (i.e. a February 1, 2021 rating decision became final).

4. In a March 2022 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for GERD, effective February 10, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 10, 2020, for the grant of GERD, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.160, 3.400, 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1992 to September 2016.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision issued by a VA AOJ. Because the August 2023 HLR rating decision on appeal was issued after February 19, 2019, it is subject to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400(a)(1); 19.2(a).

In March 2024, the Board received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct Review docket to review the August 2023 HLR rating decision issued by an AOJ.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the underlying February 2023 rating decision subject to the Veteran's May 2023 HLR request that was denied in the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board at this time. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for GERD, is denied.

The Veteran contends she is entitled to an effective date of November 17, 2019, for her grant of service connection for GERD. See March 2024 VA Form 10182.

She further argues she had good cause for not timely filing her February 10, 2022 supplemental claim for GERD in response to a February 1, 2021 rating decision denying her claim for GERD. In her appellate brief, filed with her March 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran broadly claims the COVID-19 pandemic caused her to untimely file her supplemental claim.

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection is the date the claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. However, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be the day following separation from active service. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

The date of receipt of a claim is the date on which a claim, information, or evidence is received by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).

With regard to the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought on a facts-found basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before she actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008). However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the AOJ receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers. McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

For claims received prior to March 24, 2015, the VA administrative claims process recognized formal and informal claims. A formal claim is one that has been filed in the form prescribed by VA. See 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a) (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a) (2014). An informal claim was any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under VA law. See Thomas v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 197 (2002); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.155(a) (2014). An informal claim needed to be written, and it had to identify the benefit being sought. See Rodriguez v. West, 189 F. 3d. 1351 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-5 (1998).

Effective March 24, 2015, a change in regulation requires claims be filed on standard forms, eliminating constructive receipt of claims and informal claims. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.150, 3.155, 3.160(a). Instead of informal claims, the new regulation provides that a claimant may request an application for benefits, upon receipt of which, the Secretary shall notify the claimant of the information necessary to complete the application form or form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). Non-standard narrative communications/submissions - previously construed as informal claims - will be considered a request for an application for benefits. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57660, 57661 (Sept. 25, 2014) (where a claimant submits an informal claim, VA will deem it a request for an application for benefits).

The regulation also allows a claimant to submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within a year. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). There are three ways in which a claimant may submit an intent to file a claim: (i) saved electronic application - when an application otherwise meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) is electronically initiated and saved in a claims - submission tool with a VA web-based electronic claims application system, (ii) written intent, signed and dated on the intent to file a claim form prescribed by the Secretary, and (iii) oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel, recorded in writing, and documented in the claimant's records. Id. 

When making determinations, VA is responsible for ascertaining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal," and does not require that the evidence be in exact equipoise. Id. at 780.

Finally, time limits within which claimants or beneficiaries are required to act to perfect a claim or challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended for good cause shown. Where an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, the action required of the claimant or beneficiary must be taken concurrent with or prior to the filing of a request for extension of the time limit, and good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. Denials of time limit extensions are separately appealable issues. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).

As the Veteran did not file her claim within one year of separation, for purposes of this appeal, the effective date for the Veteran's GERD is either the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

As for the date of receipt of the claim, the Veteran filed an original claim for service connection for GERD in September 2020, which was denied in a February 1, 2021 rating decision. 

The Veteran filed a supplemental claim for GERD on February 10, 2022. However, because the February 10, 2022 supplemental claim for GERD was filed more than a year after February 3, 2021 notification of the  the February 1, 2021 rating decision, it was untimely. The February 1, 2021 rating decision became final as a result.

When the Veteran filed her untimely supplemental claim for GERD, she did not request an extension for the time limit to file a supplemental claim. Further, because the February 10, 2022 supplemental claim was untimely, it is a supplemental claim seeking to reopen the Veteran's claim for GERD. The AOJ granted this reopened claim for GERD in a March 2022 rating decision, effective February 10, 2022-the date of receipt of the supplemental claim seeking to reopen the Veteran's claim for GERD

The Veteran filed a timely supplemental claim for an increased rating for her GERD in January 2023. In a February 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted an increased rating for her GERD, with the increased rating being effective from January 16, 2023-the date of the Veteran's timely supplemental claim.

The Veteran filed a HLR request, contending she is entitled to an earlier effective date of September 29, 2020-the date of her first original claim for GERD. The AOJ denied this earlier effective date in the August 2023 rating decision.

Thus, because the Veteran did not timely and continuously pursue her September 29, 2020 claim for GERD, the date of receipt of claim for effective date purposes is February 10, 2022-the date of receipt of the supplemental claim seeking to reopen the Veteran's claim for GERD.

As for the date entitlement arose, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for her claimed GERD in March 2022 and February 2023. In the report following the March 2022 VA examination, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with GERD on March 29, 2022. The March 2022 VA examiner also opined the Veteran's GERD was secondary to her service-connected disabilities. Notably, in the report following the February 2023 VA examination, the February 2023 VA examiner placed the Veteran's diagnosis of GERD in 2017.

Based on this evidence, the Veteran was originally diagnosed with GERD in 2017. See February 2023 VA examination. Thus, the date entitlement arose was in 2017 -the date of her GERD diagnosis.

Again, the effective date for the Veteran's GERD is the later of either the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose. In sum, the date of receipt of claim was February 10, 2022, and the date entitlement arose was in 2017. Because February 10, 2022, is the later date of either February 10, 2022, and 2017, the date of receipt of claim is the earliest effective date for the Veteran's claim for service connection for GERD.

Therefore, the earliest effective date for the Veteran's GERD is February 10, 2022.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's argument that her GERD claim should date back to her September 29, 2020 original claim for service connection. The Veteran contends she had good cause from untimely filing her February 10, 2022 supplemental claim. Namely, the Veteran contends the COVID-19 Pandemic caused her to untimely file February 10, 2022 supplemental claim. See March 2024 Brief.

However, in Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 248 (2002), the Court held that "[t]he statutory framework simply does not allow for the Board to reach back to the date of the original claim as a possible effective date for an award of service-connected benefits that is predicated upon a reopened claim." In order for the Veteran to be awarded an effective date based on an earlier claim, she would have to show clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the prior denial of the claim. See Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332, 340 (1995). See also Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d 1333, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir., 2005) (indicating that "no matter how [the Veteran] tries to define 'effective date,' the simple fact is that, absent a showing of CUE, he cannot receive disability payments for a time frame earlier than the application date of her claim to reopen, even with new evidence supporting an earlier disability date"). Here, the grant of service connection is predicated on a reopened claim, and the Veteran has not alleged a CUE in the previous rating decision.

Moreover, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b), time extension for filing time limits may be extended for good cause. However, the Veteran must request the extension with her untimely filing. Here, the Veteran did submit a brief with her untimely February 10, 2022 supplemental claim. Nevertheless, the Veteran did not request a time extension for her untimely filing and made no mention of the COVID-19 Pandemic impeding her from filing a timely claim. See February 10, 2022 Statement in Support of Claim.

In sum, the evidence of record shows that there is no basis under the law for establishing an effective date for service connection for GERD earlier than February 10, 2020, the date of receipt of the supplemental claim seeking to reopen the Veteran's claim for GERD. As such, the Veteran is already in receipt of the earliest possible effective date as a matter of law.

Therefore, entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for GERD, is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
