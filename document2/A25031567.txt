ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 12, 2023, for the grant of a 40 percent rating for lumbosacral strain (previously rated as degenerative arthritis with lumbar scoliosis) is denied.

Entitlement for the grant of a 40 percent rating for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) with an effective date of May 12, 2023 is granted.

Entitlement for the grant of a 40 percent rating for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) with an effective date of May 12, 2023, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that the Veteran's low back condition met the criteria for a 40 percent rating is the VA examination dated May 12, 2023.

2. The Veteran's radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities sciatic nerve more nearly approximated moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, but not severe impairment. 

3. The earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that the Veteran's radiculopathy, left lower extremity met the criteria for a 40 percent rating is the VA examination dated May 12, 2023.

4. The earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that the Veteran's radiculopathy, right lower extremity met the criteria for a 40 percent rating is the VA examination dated May 12, 2023.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to May 12, 2023, for the grant of a 40 percent rating for lumbosacral strain (previously rated as degenerative arthritis with lumbar scoliosis) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242.

2. The criteria for entitlement for the grant of a 40 percent rating for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) with an effective date of May 12, 2023, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.124(a), Diagnostic Code 8520.

3. The criteria for entitlement for the grant of a 40 percent rating for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) with an effective date of May 12, 2023, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b);38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.124(a), Diagnostic Code 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Army from January 2001 to March 2001. 

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 Regional Office (RO) rating decision.

In the VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Earlier Effective Dates 

Effective dates for claims seeking an increased rating for an already service-connected disability that are based on an original claim, or a claim for increase will be the day of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. However, the effective date may also be the earliest date as of which it is "factually ascertainable" that an increase in disability had occurred if the claim is received within one year from the date of the increase, based on a review of the entire evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see also Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997); Swanson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 442 (1999).

In determining whether an effective date assigned for an increased rating is correct or proper under the law requires (1) a determination of the date of the receipt of the claim for the increased rating as well as (2) a review of all the evidence of record to determine when an increase in disability was "ascertainable." See Hazan, 10 Vet. App. at 521. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 12, 2023, for the grant of a 30 percent rating for lumbosacral strain (previously rated as degenerative arthritis with lumbar scoliosis)

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the October 2023 rating decision reflects that a 30 percent rating for the Veterans low back condition is granted effective May 12, 2023. However, under the general rating formula for diseases and injuries of the spine, diagnostic codes 5235 to 5243, a rating of 40 percent is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine; or forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. Therefore, the correct rating for the Veterans low back condition is 40 percent. 

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than May 12, 2023, for the award of a 40 percent rating for a low back condition. The May 12, 2023, effective date, is the date that his VA examination that showed that an increased in his condition was warranted. The Veteran asserts that his effective date should be February 5, 2019, the date of his intent to file. 

As noted above, effective dates for claims seeking an increased rating for an already service-connected disability that are based on an original claim, or a claim for increase will be the day of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Disabilities of the spine are rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (General Rating Formula). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5235-5243. These criteria are to be applied irrespective of whether there are symptoms such as pain (whether or not it radiates), stiffness, or aching in the affected area of the spine, and "are meant to encompass and take into account the presence of pain, stiffness, or aching, which are generally present when there is a disability of the spine." 68 Fed. Reg. 51,454 (Aug. 27, 2003).

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.

Ankylosis is defined as "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 94 (32nd ed. 2012). Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis. Id. at Note 5

In this case, the Veteran underwent examinations for his back in April 2018, February 2020, and May 2023. 

The April 2018 disability benefits questionnaire reflected complaints of limited range of motion, difficulty with heavy lifting, bending, prolong walking or climbing stairs. The Veteran reported flare-ups of aching pain and stiffness. The Veteran exhibited forward flexion of 68 degrees and 45 degrees of flexion during flare ups. No ankylosis was noted. 

The Veterans February 2020 disability benefits questionnaire reflected symptoms of back pain, flare-ups with increased movement, bending, and twisting. The Veteran reported daily flare-ups with pain rated as 9/10. The Veteran exhibited forward flexion to 40 degrees. No ankylosis was noted. 

In May 2023 examination, the Veteran underwent a new examination, which is the basis for the current 40 percent rating for his low back condition. He reported that his condition had gotten worse with daily flare-ups. On range of motion testing, the Veteran exhibited forward flexion to 30 degrees. The examiner noted forward flexion of 15 degrees during flare-ups. 

After reviewing the evidence, the Board finds that May 12, 2023 (the date of the May 2023 examination) is the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that the Veterans low back condition met the criteria for the 40 percent rating under the rating criteria. Thus, an effective date prior to May 12, 2013, for the award of the 40 percent rating for the Veterans low back condition is not warranted. Prior to May 12, 2023, the evidence of record does not show forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the thoracolumbar spine. Rather, the Veteran exhibited forward flexion, at worst, limited to 40 degrees during the February 2020 examination and the examiner indicated there was no evidence of ankylosis. As such, the criteria for a 40 percent rating under the General Rating Formula were not met prior to May 12, 2023.

Even considering the Veteran's subjective complaints of pain and other symptoms described in DeLuca, there is no evidence that the low back condition was manifested by forward flexion limited to 30 degrees or less, ankylosis, or IVDS, such that an effective date prior to May 12, 2023, for the 40 percent rating may be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5235 to 5243; see also Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 786 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (holding that provision describing functional loss due to disability of the musculoskeletal system does not supersede requirements for a higher rating specified in the Rating Schedule). In assigning a 40 percent rating for the period on appeal, the RO considered the functional impairment and effects of pain exhibited by the low back. The Veteran has not described additional loss of motion or functional impairment that meets or more nearly approximates the criteria for a 40 percent rating prior to May 12, 2023. Thus, the VA examination dated May 12, 2023, is the earliest medical evidence as of which it is ascertainable that a 40 percent rating is warranted under the General Rating Formula or IVDS Formula.

Although the Veteran asserted that the effective date for a 40 percent rating for the low back disability should be 2019, the medical evidence, as discussed above, does not reflect findings consistent with a 40 percent rating prior to May 12, 2023. As his lay assertions are inconsistent with the objective medical evidence, a definitive date of worsening cannot be established until the range of motion testing and physical examination performed during the May 12, 2023, examination, which showed the actual severity of the low back condition. 

In sum, May 12, 2023, is the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that entitlement to a 40 percent rating for a low back condition, and an effective date prior to May 12, 2023, for the award of a 40 percent rating for the low back condition is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement of a 40 percent rating for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) with an effective date of May 12, 2023

3. Entitlement of a 40 percent rating for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) with an effective date of May 12, 2023

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than May 12, 2023, for the award of 20 percent ratings for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. The May 12, 2023, effective date, is the date that the RO determined that his VA examination that showed that an increased in his conditions was warranted. The Veteran asserts that his effective date should be February 5, 2019, the date of his intent to file. 

As discussed above, effective dates for claims seeking an increased rating for an already service-connected disability that are based on an original claim, or a claim for increase will be the day of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

The Veterans bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy is evaluated under diagnostic code (DC) 8520 for paralysis of the sciatic nerve. Under DC 8520, a rating of 20 percent is warranted when the evidence demonstrates moderate incomplete paralysis. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The words "mild," "moderate," "severe," and "marked" are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Therefore, the Board finds it appropriate to utilize definitions provided by a general-purpose dictionary. Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (in the absence of an express definition, words are given their ordinary meaning). Mild is generally defined as not being or involving what is extreme or not severe. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 787 (11th ed. 2003). Moderate is generally defined as tending toward the mean or average amount. Id. at 798. Severe is generally defined as of a great degree or serious. Id. at 1140. Thus, moderately severe, by extension, lies somewhere in the middle of these definitions. Furthermore, marked is defined as "distinctive... strongly pronounced... noticeable." Webster's Third International Dictionary (1986) at 1383.

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves." The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).

The Veterans April 2018 examination reflected mild intermittent pain, paresthesias/dysesthesias, and numbness. The examiner noted that the Veterans bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was moderate and involved the sciatic nerve. During a February 2020 examination, the examiner noted that the Veterans radiculopathy resulted in mild severity of the sciatic nerve. 

The Veterans May 2023 examination, in which the RO based the current 20 percent disability evaluation, the examiner noted that the Veterans radiculopathy symptoms resulted in severe constant pain, numbness, intermittent pain, paresthesia's and/or dysesthesias of the sciatic nerve. 

Although, the RO found that the Veterans bilateral radiculopathy of the lower extremities resulted in moderate incomplete paralysis, the Board finds that the evidence of record, specifically the May 2023 examination, supports a rating of 40 percent rating. The examiner noted that the Veterans symptoms of severe constant pain, numbness, intermittent pain, paresthesia's and/or dysesthesias of the sciatic nerve, illustrating symptoms most approximating moderately severe. As discussed above, a 40 percent rating is warranted for moderately severe incomplete paralysis. 

Looking at the totality of the evidence, the symptomology of the Veteran's radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities, sciatic nerve most nearly approximates moderately severe. There is no indication of muscular atrophy, and therefore a higher rating of 60 percent is not warranted. For all these reasons the Board finds that a 40 percent rating is warranted for bilateral radiculopathy of the lower extremities, sciatic nerve, as of May 12, 2023.

In sum, May 12, 2023, is the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that entitlement to a 40 percent rating for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy arose, and an effective date prior to May 12, 2023, for the award of a 40 percent rating for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Board grants the increased rating for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) at the rate of 40 percent effective May 12, 2023.

The Board grants the increase rating for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) at the rate of 40 percent effective May 12, 2023.
