ORDER

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome and degenerative arthritis (left knee condition limitation of flexion) is denied. 

2. Entitlement to a separate noncompensable rating for left knee condition limitation of extension is granted effective May 25, 2021.

3. Entitlement to a separate rating of 10 percent for left knee instability is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record does not show that the Veteran's left knee flexion was limited to 30 degrees.

2. The evidence of record shows that the Veteran's left knee extension was limited to 5 degrees, but no worse, as of the May 25, 2021, VA examination. 

3. With resolution of all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, he has slight left knee instability. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee limitation of flexion have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.87; Diagnostic Code (DC) 5260.

2. The criteria for a separate noncompensable rating for left knee limitation of extension have been met as of the May 25, 2021, VA examination.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.14, 4.21, 4.71a, DC 5261.

3. The criteria for a separate 10 percent disability rating for left knee instability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.14, 4.21, 4.71a, DC 5257. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from October 2010 to March 2011 and from April 2011 to July 2012.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in December 2021. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in April 2022 and elected the Direct Review Lane. In December 2023, the Board issued a decision, which in part denied entitlement to an increased rating for the Veteran's left knee condition. The Veteran appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC).  There, the parties agreed to a joint motion for partial remand (JMPR). The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim (or claims), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings that is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  Separate diagnostic codes (DCs) identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned.

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another.  38?C.F.R. § 4.3.  When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b).  When the evidence persuasively favors against the claim of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim will be denied on its merits.  38?U.S.C. §?5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Knee disabilities are rated under Diagnostic Codes 5256 through 5263. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. The various Diagnostic Codes that evaluate impairment resulting from knee disorders include 5256 (ankylosis), 5257 (other impairment, including recurrent subluxation or lateral instability), 5258 (dislocated semilunar cartilage), 5259 (symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage), 5260 (limitation of flexion), 5261 (limitation of extension), 5262 (impairment of the tibia and fibula), and 5263 (genu recurvatum).

VA amended the criteria for rating musculoskeletal disabilities effective February 7, 2021. These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after February 7, 2021.

Claims, such as this, pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria from that date, and whichever criteria is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied from that date. The Board cannot apply a current regulation prior to its effective date unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise. Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In this case, the regulation does not provide for retroactive application. 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76463 (Nov. 30, 2020) (to be codified at 38C.F.R. §38C.F.R. §4.71a). However, the Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.

Only Diagnostic Codes 5257 (knee impairment with recurrent subluxation or lateral instability) and 5262 (impairment of the tibia and fibula) were amended by the new regulations.

For claims filed prior to February 7, 2021, knee impairment with recurrent subluxation or lateral instability under Diagnostic Code 5257 is rated 10 percent when slight, 20 percent when moderate, and 30 percent when severe. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. Objective medical evidence is not required to establish lateral knee instability under Diagnostic Code 5257, so objective medical evidence cannot be categorically found more probative than lay evidence with respect to this Diagnostic Code. See English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347, 352-53 (2018).

For claims filed on or after February 7, 2021, Diagnostic Code 5257 provides two separate rating criteria: one pertaining to recurrent subluxation and instability and the other addressing patellar instability. Knee impairment with recurrent subluxation or lateral instability is rated as 10 percent disabling for a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired or failed repair) causing persistent instability without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device or bracing for ambulation. A 20 percent rating is warranted for either (a) sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or an assistive device for ambulation or (b) an unrepaired or failed repair of a complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g., cane, crutch, walker) or brace for ambulation. A 30 percent rating is assigned for an unrepaired or failed repair of a complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane, crutch, walker) and a brace for ambulation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Patellar instability is rated as 10 percent disabling a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker. A 20 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: a brace, cane, or walker. The maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker.

Prior to February 7, 2021, under diagnostic code 5262 for impairment of the tibia and fibula a rating of 10 percent is warranted if there is evidence of malunion with slight knee or ankle disability; a rating of 20 percent is warranted if there is evidence of malunion with moderate knee or ankle disability; a rating of 30 percent is warranted if there is evidence of malunion with marked knee or ankle disability; and a rating of 40 percent is warranted if there is nonunion of the tibia and fibula with loose motion, requiring a brace.

Beginning February 7, 2021, and thereafter, under Diagnostic Code 5262, a noncompensable rating is warranted for treatment less than 12 consecutive months involving one or both lower extremities. A 10 percent rating is warranted for treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, one or both lower extremities. A 20 percent rating is warranted for treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotic or other conservative treatment, one lower extremity. A 30 percent rating is warranted for treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, both lower extremities.

Other diagnostic codes pertaining to the knee are 5256 (ankylosis), 5258 (cartilage, semilunar, dislocated, with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint), 5259 (cartilage, semilunar, removal of, symptomatic), 5260 (limitation of flexion), 5261 (limitation of extension), and 5263 (genu recurvatum).

Diagnostic Code 5258, which contemplates cartilage, semilunar, dislocated, with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint, provides for a 20 percent maximum rating.

Diagnostic Code 5259, which contemplates cartilage, semilunar, removal of, symptomatic, provides for a 10 percent maximum rating.

Under Diagnostic Code 5260, a noncompensable rating is warranted when flexion is limited to 60 degrees; a 10 percent rating is warranted where flexion is limited to 45 degrees; a 20 percent rating is warranted where flexion is limited to 30 degrees; and a maximum 30 percent rating is warranted where flexion is limited to 15 degrees. Full knee flexion is to 140 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Under Diagnostic Code 5261, a noncompensable rating is warranted when extension is limited to 5 degrees; a 10 percent rating is warranted where extension is limited to 10 degrees; a 20 percent rating is warranted where extension is limited to 15 degrees; a 30 percent rating is warranted where extension is limited to 20 degrees; a 40 percent rating is warranted where extension is limited to 30 degrees; and a maximum 50 percent rating is warranted where extension is limited to 45 degrees. Full knee extension is to zero degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

In determining the degree of limitation of motion, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 concerning lack of normal endurance, functional loss due to pain, and pain on use and during flare-ups; the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 concerning weakened movement, excess fatigability, and incoordination; and the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.10 concerning the effects of the disability on the veteran's ordinary activity are for consideration. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011). This includes any functional loss resulting in the equivalent of ankylosis during flareups or with repeated use over time. See Chavis v. McDonough 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021).

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee limitation of flexion.

2. Entitlement to a separate compensable rating for left knee limitation of extension.

3. Entitlement to a separate rating for left knee instability.  

The Veteran is currently rated at 10 percent disabling under DC 5260 for limitation of flexion of the left knee. In accordance with CAVC remand instructions, the Board is to consider whether separate compensable ratings are warranted under DCs 5261 and DC 5257.

A VA examination was provided in July 2020. There, the Veteran stated that he suffered from knee pain, made worse by prolonged weightbearing, and sitting, especially with his knee flexed. Upon examination, the Veteran's left knee was found to have normal range of motion; however, pain was noted on flexion. Observed repetitive use testing did not cause any loss of range of motion or increase in functional loss. Flareups were reported, with the examiner not estimating any loss of range of motion. No additional factors were found that would contribute to the Veteran's disability. Joint stability and muscle strength testing were normal. There was no evidence of crepitus or ankylosis. The VA examiner found that, due to pain alone, the Veteran's condition limited prolonged sitting and weightbearing.  See July 2020 C&P Exam. The AOJ granted a 10 percent rating in July 2020 for the Veteran's left knee condition's limitation of flexion.  See July 2020 Rating Decision - Narrative. 

Moreover, a private treatment record from May 2020 reports active range of motion of the left knee with flexion at 135 degrees and extension at 0 degrees. 

In October 2020, the Veteran submitted VA Form 21-526EZ. A VA examination was provided in May 2021. Upon examination, the Veteran's left knee flexion was to 110 degrees and extension was to 5 degrees, without evidence of pain. Passive range of motion showed no change in flexion, and extension was normal. No change was found in repeated use over time testing or observed repetitive use testing. However, the Board notes that pain was found on both repeated use over time and observed use testing. The examination showed no evidence of crepitus, joint instability, or ankylosis.  See July 2021 C&P Exam. 

VA examination was also provided in December 2021. Active range of motion was noted to be flexion at 130 degrees and extension at 0 degrees. Pain was noted upon range of motion testing, and the same range of motion was reported for passive range of motion as active range of motion. There was evidence of pain on weight-bearing, nonweight-bearing, active motion, passive motion, on rest/non-movement, and such was noted to limit his walking and standing. There was objective evidence of crepitus but no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation. No additional range of motion was lost during repetitive-use testing. Ankylosis was not noted, and no report of a tibial or fibula impairment or of a meniscal condition were found. The Veteran reported using a brace, but no instability was reported.  

The AOJ granted service connection in December 2021 and stated that the Veteran's left knee arthritis would be evaluated with his service-connected left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with degenerative arthritis, at 10 percent disabling.  See December 2021 Rating Decision - Narrative. 

In April 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 and elected the Direct Review Lane. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence before the AOJ at the time of the December 2021 rating decision. 

The Board begins with the Veteran's limitation of flexion under DC 5260 and the question of whether an increased rating is warranted. The Board finds that a rating in excess of 10 degrees is not warranted, as the evidence of record does not show flexion limited to 30 degrees at any time during the appellate period. The Board notes that in the JMPR instructions, the parties did not indicate any errors in this finding. 

Additionally, as per JMPR instructions, the Board has considered whether separate ratings are warranted. Separate ratings under DC 5260 and 5261 may be assigned for disability of the same knee joint.  See VAOPGCPREC 9-2004. In determining whether separate ratings are warranted, the predicate element in assigning several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disabilities is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disability.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994). 

DC 5261, as stated above, provides that a 10 percent rating is warranted where extension is limited to 10 degrees. Here, the evidence of record shows that extension was to no more than 5 degrees throughout the period on appeal, and that as of the May 25, 2021, examination the Veteran's extension was limited to 5 degrees. As such, as of May 25, 2021, a separate noncompensable rating is warranted. The Board acknowledges that, prior to the May 2021 VA examination, it was possible that the Veteran experienced pain or discomfort due to left knee extension. However, any pain or discomfort had already been compensated under the Veteran's 10 percent rating for limitation of flexion under DC 5260. The Veteran cannot receive compensation under two different codes for the same manifestations of symptoms, as this would constitute impermissible pyramiding under 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. It is for this reason that the Board finds that a separate rating for limitation of extension is warranted from May 25, 2021, the date in which the evidence of record showed limitation of extension to 5 degrees. In the absence of evidence of left knee limitation of extension limited to ten degrees or more, a compensable rating may not be provided. 

Finally, as per the JMPR instructions, the Board has also considered whether a separate rating is warranted for left knee instability under DC 5257. The Board notes that VAOPGCPREC 23-97 held that a claimant who has both arthritis and instability of the knee may receive two separate disability ratings under DC 5257 based either on limitation of motion under DCs 5260 or 5261, or on painful motion without violating the prohibition of pyramiding of ratings.  See 62 Fed. Reg. 63603, 63604 (1997). 

In the present case, VA examinations were provided and in all examinations, the VA examiners found that the Veteran did not have left knee instability, instability of station or joint instability. No history of recurrent subluxation or lateral instability was found.  See July 2020 C&P Exam, see also July 2021 C&P Exam. 

However, as identified by the parties in the January 2025 JMPR, the Veteran had made several reports of instability prior to the rating decision on appeal. Specifically, in July 2020, the Veteran reported that his left knee was unstable, as was his right knee.  See July 2020 Form 9. In August 2021, the Veteran reported that his left knee would pop, give out, and regularly dislocate, causing him to lose balance.  See August 2021 VA 21-4138. Furthermore, in December 2021, the Veteran claimed lateral instability and questioned why it was not in his claims file.  See December 2021 VA 21-4138. Moreover, at the December 2021 VA  examination, the Veteran 

Given the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements in regard to his left knee popping, giving out, dislocating, and causing him to lose balance, the Board finds that the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether symptoms of the Veteran's left knee condition have more nearly approximated recurrent lateral instability or subluxation. However, in light of the consistently specific and normal stability findings on repeated VA examinations and a lack of indication in the Veteran's medical records of instability, the weight of the evidence is against a finding that the symptoms more nearly approximated moderate instability. Therefore, with reasonable doubt being in favor of the Veteran, a separate 10 percent disability rating is warranted for mild instability of the left knee. As the evidence of record does not support a higher disability rating, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for further application.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

As delineated above the Board declines to apply any additional knee DCs. Ankylosis, tibia or fibula impairment, or genu recurvatum are not indicated by either lay or medical evidence for either knee as noted above. The Board has considered the Veteran's claims and decided entitlement based on the evidence. The Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with respect to his appeal. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
