DOCKET NO. 201021-117458
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided for an episode of care on May 19, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran received care through the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) by an authorized in-network provider on May 19, 2020; the billing process and rates of payment are governed by statutory and contractual authority that does not allow for review by the Board, instead the claims for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical treatment is subject to the specific claims processing and dispute resolution provisions laid out in the provider's contract as part of the Community Care Network (CCN).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to payment for non-VA medical services provided on May 19, 2020, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1703D, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4030, 17.4035

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1988 to August 1992.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2020 determination from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

In October 2020, the Veteran disagreed with the abovementioned rating decision and filed a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)).  The Veteran selected the Evidence Review Lane under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d).  Accordingly, the Board is limited to review of the evidence in the record at the time of the notice for the decision on appeal and the evidence submitted up to 90 days after the Veteran's VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the above claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.   

Dismissal

The Board has jurisdiction in all matters where there is a question of law or fact necessary for a decision by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans or their dependents or survivors.  38 U.S.C. § 7104.  The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege a specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105. 

The September 2020 Denial Letter for the Veteran's claim indicated that he did not meet the requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 1703, and that the claim was denied for lack of pre-authorization for the Veteran's treatment which was non-emergent.   The Veteran submitted an October 2020 VA Form 10182, wherein the Veteran argued that he was allowed to use urgent care facilities for non-emergent care, and indicated that he attached sheets that did not indicate that he needed preauthorization.  The Veteran attached webpage printouts regarding VA Community Care, and a page noting that the facility he went to was part of the CCN.

The Board notes that disputes under the VCCP or Veterans Care Agreements (VCAs), to include reimbursement of payment for related care, do not fall within the Board's jurisdiction.  38 U.S.C. § 1703(f) (effective June 6, 2019) ("The review of any decision under [the VCCP] shall be subject to the Department's clinical appeals process, and such decisions may not be appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals"); 38 C.F.R. § 17.4135(c)(5) (effective June 6, 2019) (disputes with VCAs will result in a written decision by the responsible VA official and constitute VA's final decision on the dispute).  

As the Veteran's claim arises out of a dispute arising from a decision under the VCCP, the Board does not have jurisdiction, and the Veteran's claim for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical treatment is subject to the specific claims processing and dispute resolution provisions laid out in the provider's contract as part of the CCN.

Accordingly, since decisions under the VCCP (effective June 6, 2019), including those related to payment for services, are not appealable to the Board pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1703(f), the Board does not have the authority to review the Veteran's claim, and it must be dismissed.
