DOCKET NO. 190916-30729
DATE: April 7, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 15, 2016, for the grant of an increased rating to 100 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) prior to June 15, 2016, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1965 to July 1968.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2018 rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO).

This matter was previously before the Board in July 2023. At which time, the Board denied entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 15, 2016, for the grant of an increased rating to 100 percent for the Veteran's PTSD. The Veteran appealed the Board's July 2023 decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) and in a November 2024 Order, the Court granted the parties' Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) and remanded the issue of entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 15, 2016, for the grant of an increased rating to 100 percent for PTSD as well as entitlement to a TDIU to the Board for additional development and readjudication.

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 15, 2016, for the grant of an increased rating to 100 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

2. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) prior to June 15, 2016, is remanded.

These matters must be remanded to obtain outstanding treatment records to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error identified by the parties in the JMR.

In the November 2024 JMR, the parties agreed that remand was warranted in order for the Board to order the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) to make all reasonable efforts to obtain previously identified treatment records prior to adjudication of the Veteran's appeal. Specifically, the JMR indicated that prior to the AOJ decision on appeal, there were records indicating the Veteran had received mental health treatment for his service-connected PTSD at the Detroit Vet Center for several years. However, there was only one document located in the claims file from the Vet Center. Therefore, the parties to the JMR agreed that because these records are potentially relevant to the question of an earlier effective date for the Veteran's 100 percent PTSD rating, a remand is warranted in order to obtain them.  See Solomon v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 396, 401 (1994) (once VA is on notice that records supporting a veteran's claim may exist, VA has a duty to attempt to locate and obtain those records).

As an aside, the Board notes the portion of the JMR where, without conceding error, it was noted VA should consider whether TDIU was continuously pursued and, therefore, pending prior to the July 2023 Board decision.  See Harper v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 356, 359 (2018). As the matter of TDIU is inextricably intertwined with the Veteran's PTSD claim remanded herein, the Board will forego the discussion and notes the portion of the remand solely to note consideration of the contention should be made after development is complete in compliance with the JMR. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain all mental health treatment records prior to June 2016 from the Vet Center in Detroit, Michigan. 

All efforts to obtain the Veteran's Vet Center records must be documented in the claims file and if it is determined that further efforts would be futile, a memorandum outlining all steps taken and conclusions reached should be drafted and associated with the claims file.

2. After the above development, and any additionally indicated development, has been completed, readjudicate the issues on appeal.
