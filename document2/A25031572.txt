ORDER

The appeal of a proposed reduction for multiple myeloma is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The October 2024 rating decision is merely a non-final proposal to reduce the Veteran's multiple myeloma rating; therefore, the present appeal fails to identify an adjudicative determination with which the Veteran disagrees.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to dismiss the appeal of a proposed reduction for multiple myeloma have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from May 1967 to March 1970.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an October 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran timely submitted his VA Form 10182 in February 2025, and now appeals the October 2024 rating decision.  In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  See February 2025 VA Form 10182.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Additionally, the Board notes that the Veteran submitted evidence alongside his February 2025 VA Form 10182 wherein he selected the direct review docket.  The Veteran was properly notified that the Board could not consider that evidence in the March 2025 direct review docketing letter.  See March 2025 BVA Docketing Letter; see also Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2023) (holding that VA's obligation in the face of confusion regarding the claimant's notice of disagreement docket election is to contact the claimant).

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Finally, the Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), in which the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2).  Because the present appeal is advanced on the docket, the Board is dismissing the claim, and the Veteran's rating was never actually reduced for any period and he is in receipt of the maximum rating for his disability, the Board is satisfied that the Veteran is not prejudiced by the Board issuing this decision without such a delay.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c).

The Veteran asserts that his multiple myeloma is active and that the AOJ's proposed reduction should be reversed.  See December 2024 VA Form 21-4138.  He also asserts that he is currently undergoing chemotherapy for his multiple myeloma.  See February 2025 VA Form 10182.

The October 2024 rating decision on appeal proposed a reduction of the Veteran's multiple myeloma rating from 100 percent to 0 percent.  See October 2024 Rating Decision.  The February 2025 VA Form 10182 identified the Veteran's proposed rating reduction as the issue on appeal, with the Veteran stating "I am in stage 3 multiple myeloma," that in his bone marrow draw, "80% of the marrow are plasma cells," and that his current treatment consisted of chemotherapy.  See February 2025 VA Form 10182.  While the Veteran did not specifically identify the October 2024 rating decision as the decision on appeal, it was the only rating decision within a year of the February 2025 VA Form 10182. 

A notice of disagreement, or VA Form 10182, may only be filed with respect to an "adjudication of a specific entitlement as described in 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(c)."  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).  The October 2024 proposed rating reduction did not constitute an adjudication of entitlement, but merely a proposal for future adjudication.  See Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 461 (2011) (holding a deferred decision does not constitute an "adjudicative determination" from which a notice of disagreement may be filed).  If there were any remaining doubt that the October 2024 rating decision was mere proposal for a reduction rather than an adjudicative determination, the Board notes that in the October 2024 decision on appeal, there was no effective date for the rating reduction.  See October 2024 Rating Decision.

In the alternative, even if the Veteran had appealed an adjudicative determination from which a notice of disagreement may be filed, the AOJ subsequently continued his 100 percent rating in a March 2025 rating decision, meaning that his 100 percent rating was never reduced.  See March 2025 Rating Decision.  Favorable findings from the March 2025 decision include that the Veteran had symptomatic multiple myeloma; likewise, June 2024 VA treatment records show that the Veteran's multiple myeloma was active.  Id.; see VA Treatment Records.  

As such, there is no question of law or fact currently on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  Accordingly, the appeal of the proposed rating reduction was not proper and must be hereby DISMISSED.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.
