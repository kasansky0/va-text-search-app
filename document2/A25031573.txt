ORDER

A 30 percent rating from January 10, 2021, to January 9, 2022, and a 60 percent rating thereafter for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with esophagitis and gallbladder removal with residual gastrointestinal problems is granted.

REMANDED

Service connection for tension headaches is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. From January 10, 2021, to January 9, 2022, the Veteran's GERD symptoms were not noted to be productive of considerable or severe impairment of health; gallbladder removal with residual gastrointestinal problems approximated mild symptoms.

2. As of January 10, 2022, the Veteran's GERD symptoms more closely approximated those productive of considerable impairment of health; his gallbladder removal with residual gastrointestinal problems approximated mild symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a 30 percent rating for GERD with esophagitis and gallbladder removal with residual gastrointestinal problems from January 10, 2021, to January 9, 2022, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.114, Diagnostic Codes (DCs) 7346-7318.

2. The criteria for a 60 percent rating for GERD with esophagitis and gallbladder removal with residual gastrointestinal problems as of January 10, 2022, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.114, DCs 7346-7318.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2018 to August 2021. His service decorations include the Army Achievement Medal.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 and January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for service connection for headaches, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The effective date of increased ratings "shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date, otherwise the date of receipt of the claim." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2). The phrase "otherwise, date of receipt of claim" applies only if a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within one year prior to filing the claim for an increased rating. Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997). Moreover, the term "increase" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 means an increase to the next disability level. See Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997).

GERD

The Veteran's GERD has been assigned a 10 percent rating pursuant to DC 7346 as of his August 2021 grant of service connection. The claim on appeal to the Board stems from the Veteran's June 2022 request for a higher rating for his GERD. See June 2022 Fully Developed Claim. However, VA received an intent to file (ITF) from the Veteran on January 10, 2022. Thus, as noted above, the period on review to the Board is as of the year prior to the Veteran's ITF, or as of January 10, 2021.

The Board notes that in May 2024, revisions to the applicable DCs were made, which now directs that GERD be rated by analogy under DC 7203. DC 7203 requires dilation of an esophageal stricture for 30 or 50 percent ratings and additional severe enumerated symptoms due to stricture for an 80 percent rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7203. The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise. See Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal. 

Here, the Veteran's claim for a higher rating was received and adjudicated prior to the May 19, 2024, revisions took effect. Indeed, as discussed above, the entire period on appeal pre-dates the 2024 revisions (the rating decision on appeal was issued and received prior to May 2024). Thus, the Board has analyzed the Veteran's claim pursuant to the pre-2024 revisions to DC 7346. 

Prior to the 2024 revisions, GERD was rated by analogy pursuant to DC 7346, which provided for 10 percent rating if there were two or more of the symptoms associated with a 30 percent rating but of a lesser severity. A 30 percent rating was assigned for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. A 60 percent rating was assigned for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss, and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

The Veteran's GERD was assessed for severity in VA examinations conducted in January 2021, June and October 2022, and June 2023. None of these examinations indicated that the Veteran's GERD was productive of either considerable impairment of health or severe impairment of health. 

The Veteran's January 2021 VA examination noted the Veteran's GERD caused dysphagia, pyrosis, and reflux. He stated he felt like food would get caught in his throat. No functional impairment caused by his GERD was noted.

Thus, based on this examination, the Board finds that the Veteran's GERD did not show an ascertainable increase in disability in the year prior to his January 2022 ITF. His symptoms were such that a 10 percent rating during that period was appropriate.

However, as of the Veteran's June 2022 VA examination, he was found to have symptoms which included persistent recurrent episodes of epigastric distress, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, and sleep disturbance. Each examination found the Veteran's GERD caused functional impairment. 

The Board finds that resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and in consideration of his symptoms, his GERD is productive of considerable impairment of health which equates to a 30 percent rating throughout the period on appeal. The Veteran's symptoms were reported to cause him difficulty in eating, sleeping, and focusing. His examinations noted sleep disturbance 4 or more times a year as a result of his GERD. In his June 2023 examination, he noted loss of appetite and that he was scared to eat at work which increased his anxiety and fatigue. Reviewing the record, the Board finds that such symptoms and the impact of the documented symptoms are more closely approximated by a 30 percent rating as of his January 10, 2022, ITF.

Additionally, the Board notes that the Veteran is also service connected for the residuals of an in-service gallbladder removal. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, separate ratings for most digestive conditions are impermissible. However, the provisions do state that when more than one rating is warranted under those diagnostic codes, a single evaluation under the diagnostic code that reflects the predominant disability picture should be assigned which then can be elevated to the next higher evaluation if warranted by the severity of the overall disability.

A January 2024 VA examination of the Veteran's gallbladder showed the Veteran had his gallbladder removed in 2018, during his active duty, and had residual symptoms since that time. The examiner found the Veteran had mild symptoms attributable to his gallbladder removal.

As with GERD, the diagnostic code for residual symptoms of a gallbladder removal were revised in 2024. Again, as the rating decision on appeal was issued prior to the May 2024 revisions, the Board is analyzing the Veteran's claim according to the pre-revision criteria. Gallbladder residuals are evaluated pursuant to DC 7318. Prior to May 19, 2024, DC 7318 provided that a 10 rating was warranted for removal of gallbladder with mild symptoms and a 30 percent rating is warranted for removal of the gallbladder with severe symptoms. 

Thus, based on the January 2024 VA examination, the Veteran's gallbladder removal residuals would warrant a 10 percent rating. As the Board cannot assign a separate rating, and pursuant to the directives of § 4.114, the Board thus finds that an elevation of the Veteran's GERD rating is warranted. Thus, in consideration of his GERD symptoms combined with the symptoms associated with his gallbladder removal, the Board assigns a 30 percent rating as of January 10, 2021 (a year prior to his ITF) and a 60 percent rating as of his January 10, 2022, ITF. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Tension Headaches

The Veteran has sought service connection for headaches as due to his service-connected GERD and mental health disorder. Prior to the issuance of the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, VA examinations were conducted regarding the etiology of the Veteran's headaches. The examinations found that the Veteran's headaches were not caused by his GERD or mental health disorder, but did not address whether the Veteran's headaches were aggravated by his GERD or mental health disorder. See June 2023 VA examination opinions. Thus, the June 2023 VA examination opinions are incomplete and represent a pre-decisional duty to assist error which must be corrected on remand.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a VA examination opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's headaches. The claims file should be made available to the examiner for review.

The examiner must opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's headaches were aggravated by his service-connected GERD and/or mental health disorder. 

The Veteran's lay statements regarding onset and continuity of symptomology should be recorded and considered.

The examiner is advised that for secondary service connection, "aggravation" need not be permanent in nature and the opinion should be provided without regard to the phrase "beyond its natural progression.". Ward v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 233, 241-42 (2019) and Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (2023).

A rationale for all opinions must be provided.
