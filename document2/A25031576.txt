ORDER

The claim of entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent from July 28, 1999, to February 5, 2001, for service-connected bilateral hearing loss, is denied. 

From February 5, 2001, the claim of entitlement to a disability rating of 50 percent, for service-connected bilateral hearing loss, is granted.

From March 10, 2005, the claim of entitlement to a disability rating of 80 percent, for service-connected bilateral hearing loss, is granted.

The claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 23, 2017, for the award of a 100 percent disability rating for service-connected bilateral hearing loss, is granted.

From March 23, 2017, entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k) for deafness is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. From July 28, 1999, to February 5, 2001, the Veteran's bilateral hearing was manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than Level III for the right ear and Level VII for the left ear.

2. From February 5, 2001, the Veteran's bilateral hearing was manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than Level VIII in the right ear and Level IX in the left ear.

3. From March 10, 2005, the Veteran's bilateral hearing was manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than Level IX in the right ear and Level XI in the left ear.

4. From March 23, 2017, the Veteran's bilateral hearing was manifested by hearing acuity of Level XI in the right ear and Level XI in the left ear.

5. From March 23, 2017, the Veteran's hearing impairment manifested in total deafness, entitling him to an earlier effective date for the award of special monthly compensation for deafness.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. From July 28, 1999, to February 5, 2001, the criteria for a rating in excess of 20 percent for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100.

2. February 5, 2001, the criteria for a rating of 50 percent, but no higher, for bilateral hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, DC 6100.

3. From March 10, 2005, the criteria for a rating of 80 percent, but no higher, for bilateral hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, DC 6100.

4. From March 23, 2017, the criteria for a rating of 100 percent for bilateral hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, DC 6100.

5. From March 23, 2017, the criteria for entitlement to SMC(k) have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (a)(5),

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had honorable active duty service in the United States Army from July 1963 to June 1966 and from April 1977 to December 1995.  

The Board will address the unusual and extensive procedural history of this appeal more fully in the section below; however, the rating decision on immediate appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) was issued in January 2025 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  The modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies to this appeal.

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket and waived his right to switch to another docket to avoid further delay in the adjudication of his appeal.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024) (Under the AMA, absent some form of waiver, the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an AMA docket switch has elapsed).  The Board appreciates the Veteran's proactive communication regarding this waiver.

Therefore, in deciding the claim on appeal, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2025 AOJ rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board further acknowledges that in March 2025 it separately issued a decision regarding pending contentions alleging clear and unmistakable errors (CUE) in prior rating decisions and that also addressed the Veteran's historic hearing loss ratings.  The Board's instant decision purely addresses the Veteran's claim for increased ratings throughout the pending appeal period and does not address specific instances of potential CUE in AOJ rating decisions.  

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket.

1. Whether a disability rating in excess of 20 percent is warranted from July 28, 1999, to February 5, 2001, for service-connected bilateral hearing loss.

See section five, below.

2. Whether an effective date prior to March 28, 2008, is warranted for the assignment of a 50 percent disability rating for service-connected bilateral hearing loss.

See section five, below.

3. Whether an effective date prior to August 1, 2014, March 10, 2005, is warranted for the assignment of an 80 percent disability rating for service-connected bilateral hearing loss.

See section five, below.

4. The claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 23, 2017, for the award of a 100 percent disability rating for service-connected bilateral hearing loss.

See section five, below.

5. Whether an effective date prior to May 19, 2017, is warranted for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of SMC(k).

Regarding his service-connected bilateral hearing loss, the Veteran seeks the highest available disability ratings from the earliest possible effective dates, consistent with applicable caselaw and regulations.  More fundamentally, the Veteran's lay statements to the Board make clear that he simply wishes for his bilateral hearing loss disability to be accurately rated and fully adjudicated-throughout the entire pending appeal period-based on all relevant and existing evidence now of record.  See, e.g., Correspondence received January 30, 2025, and February 10, 2025.

The Board will briefly summarize the extensive procedural history of this matter before proceeding to the merits of the underlying claim for increase.

An August 2018 rating decision increased the Veteran's rating for hearing loss from 80 percent to 100 percent effective August 30, 2017.  The Veteran submitted a timely Notice of Disagreement (NOD).  In April 2019, the Regional Office (RO) issued a Statement of the Case (SOC), but the Veteran later opted this claim into the AMA via a May 2019 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR).  See also, HLR of the April 2019 rating decision.

In a May 2019 HLR decision, VA found an error with the duty to assist and indicated it would develop for a VA examination addendum and to obtain a copy of a 2005 audiogram.  In January 2020, VA issued a rating decision associated with the HLR.  The Veteran appealed the April 30, 2019, and January 30, 2020, rating decisions to the Board.

A Board decision in December 2020 denied the Veteran's claim for an effective date prior to August 30, 2017, for the grant of a 100 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss.  The Board also denied the Veteran's claims regarding whether there was CUE in relevant past rating decisions.  The Veteran appealed the Board's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). 

In a Memorandum Decision dated September 2021, the Court vacated the Board's decision and remanded the case for readjudication.  In a March 2022 decision, the Board granted an earlier effective date of May 19, 2017, for the Veteran's 100 percent hearing loss rating.  This decision also granted a 50 percent rating effective from March 28, 2008, to July 31, 2014.  In April 2023, the Board denied an earlier effective date for the 100 percent rating of bilateral hearing loss.  The Veteran appealed the denial to the Court.

In January 2024, the Court granted a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) submitted by the Veteran and VA's Office of General Counsel (OGC), which vacated the portion of the Board's April 2023 decision denying the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for his 100 percent rating for his bilateral hearing loss.  The Court remanded the case back to the Board for further development.

In June 2024, the Board remanded the matter to the AOJ; however, in so doing, the Board made the significant determination that a July 2000 AOJ rating decision did not become final for increased rating purposes as VA failed to consider evidence constructively received within the year following that rating decision, citing Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348, 1355(Fed. Cir. 2020), 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b), and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  As such, the Board found that the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for bilateral hearing loss had remained pending from July 28, 1999, which was the effective date of the Veteran's 20 percent rating.

On remand, in a July 2024 rating decision, the RO again denied entitlement to an earlier effective date for the assigned bilateral hearing loss ratings.

In parallel to the above actions of the Veteran, the Court, the Board, and the AOJ, the Veteran had made attempts (through Freedom of Information and Privacy Act requests) to obtain all records of his past audiometric evaluations conducted by VA examiners as well as by his treating VA audiologists in Atlanta.  See May 2018 letter from VA's OGC (detailing the steps VA took to obtain copies of the audiology records and concluding that some of the electronic audiometric test record files were "corrupted" and that paper copies were missing).  Undeterred, the Veteran continued his efforts to obtain copies of the records, which eventually led him to petition the Court for extraordinary relief in the form of a Writ of Mandamus.  

In December 2024, the Veteran submitted a copy of OGC's November 2024 answer in response to his petition.  Of most importance to the Board's instant decision, OGC determined that as of September 2024, "new information" had been obtained to explain previous negative search results as described in OGC's 2018 letter.  According to OGC, prior to 2019/2020, the Atlanta VA's audiology department did not have a computer-based audiometer, so data had to be manually entered into a software system.  A now-retired audiologist at that location entered some of the Veteran's audiometric data only into one records system but not into VA's Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).  Apparently, once this was discovered, the test results were easily accessed and printed.  OGC attached three exhibits to its filing, which included the theretofore "missing" hearing tests dated March 5, 2001, and March 10, 2005, as well as a copy of an April 2001 hearing aid evaluation note (that did not contain audiometric data).  Accordingly, it was at the time of this submission that the Veteran's complete VA audiometric data, which had been constructively of record since its creation, became formally associated with the Veteran's claim file. 

Regrettably, it appears that when the Board issued its most recent remand in early December 2024, the Board was not aware of OGC's filing with the Court (likely due to the timing that the OGC filing was associated with the electronic claims file) as the Board's December 2024 remand directed the AOJ to obtain a medical opinion that accounted for what it still considered to be missing data.  

Additionally regrettable is that it appears that the AOJ, in promptly responding to the Board's remand, did not notice or consider the OGC response and exhibits prior to obtaining a medical opinion as directed by the Board, as the audiologist who provided the December 2024 opinion did not acknowledge the existence of that new data.  

Fortunately, the Board need not rely on that examiner's opinion regarding those specific test results as the record now contains the previously missing audiometric results, and the Board may apply the rating criteria to these results as it normally would without the need for separate interpretation from a clinician.  The Board understands the Veteran to affirm that there is no need for the Board to remand this matter for additional clarification from another audiologist.  According to a February 2025 Correspondence, the Veteran stated that "there is no missing data for any VA hearing test since 1996," and the Veteran expressly indicated that his desire is for a final Board decision that considers all of his audiometric data in rating his hearing loss disability.  

Genuinely, the Board appreciates the Veteran's diligence in ensuring that his appeal be properly adjudicated based on all existing relevant evidence and the Board acknowledges the lengths the Veteran has gone to in achieving resolution of this claim.  See, e.g., Correspondence received January 30, 2025, and February 10, 2025.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by the application of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which assigns ratings based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings will be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more closely approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In general, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz).  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, DC 6100.

To evaluate the degree of disability from bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII.  

Speech discrimination tests listed as CID W-22 (Central Institute of the Deaf) or NU-6 (Northwestern University Auditory Test Number Six) are not Maryland CNC.  If the speech recognition scores are not Maryland CNC, then the audiometric evaluation is not adequate for rating purposes under § 4.85(a).  However, if the examiner certifies that use of the speech discrimination test is not appropriate because of language difficulties, inconsistent speech discrimination scores, etc., or when there is an exceptional pattern of hearing loss under § 4.86, then the Hertz decibel readings can be applied to Table VIA.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(a) (if there is an exceptional pattern of hearing loss, the requirements of § 4.85(a) regarding examination adequacy for rating purposes still apply.).

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a).  In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Further, when the average pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b).

Relevant VA examinations and VA medical center audiometric findings generated throughout the rating period are listed below.  The Board has used an "X" to designate any data not included or tested.  

10/27/1999	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	45	55	65	90	63.75	88

LEFT	60	70	90	105	81.25	74

Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level III in the right ear (rounding up to 64) and Level VI in the left ear (rounding down to 81).  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designations to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a 10 percent disability rating under DC 6100.  However, an exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was shown in the left ear.  Applying the results to Table VIA yields Level VII in the in the left ear.  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level III for the right ear and Level VII for the left ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a 20 percent disability rating under DC 6100, as currently assigned.  Here, Table VIA yields the highest rating for the left ear and the Board accepts that as the appropriate rating based on this data.

02/05/2001	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	50	65	X (75)	95	71.25	56

LEFT	65	80	X (100)	115	90	44

This February 2001 testing data is located within a document titled, "VA9K Summary Audiological Data."  The speech reception threshold (SRT) word test use is not identified; however, results appear to be 56 percent in the right ear and 44 percent in the left ear, and, without evidence to the contrary, the Board accepts these as valid discrimination scores.  See January 2020 VA medical opinion.  

The Board acknowledges that a reading at 3000 Hz is not included in this summary; however, complete data was collected in the heretofore missing hearing test dated a mere one month later (listed below).  Resolving this absent data in a way most favorable to the Veteran, the Board has utilized the 3000 Hz reading from the later March 2001 test in applying the rating criteria to these readings.  The Board finds this interpretation consistent with the December 2024 VA examiner's opinion, which stated that all one could determine for the missing 3000 Hz data was that it would more likely than not be between the earlier 1999 test data and the 2005 data.  Again, as noted above, it appears this examiner did not have access to the March 2001 data.  The Board has thus applied the logic of the examiner's reasoning to the now available data, as the examiner opined that the Veteran's thresholds from 1996 to 2005 were "consistent and progressive" even without access to data at 3000 Hz.

Applying this interpretation of the results to Table VII, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level VIII in the right ear and Level IX in the left ear.  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designations to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a 50 percent disability rating under DC 6100, effective February 5, 2001.

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was shown in the left ear.  Applying the results to Table VIA yields Level VIII in the in the left ear.  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level VIII for the right ear and Level VIII for the left ear to Table VII, also equates to a 50 percent disability rating under DC 6100, as currently assigned.  

A March 2001 VA treatment evaluation shows the following:

03/05/2001	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	50	65	75	95	71.25	X

LEFT	65	80	100	115	90	X

An exceptional pattern of hearing loss was only shown in the left ear.  This data does not result in a higher than 50 percent rating, even if the Board were to utilize the CNC score from the February 2001 test.

Results from a March 2005 examination are as follows:

03/10/2005	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	55	65	80	100	75	48

LEFT	65	80	110	110	91.25	32

The Board acknowledges that an accompanying March 15, 2005, VA treatment note states that the Veteran's examination findings were "essentially unchanged from his previous examination in 2001; however, as the Board now has access to the exact measurement data, it has applied that data to the rating criteria.  The Board notes that the word test used was not clearly identified in the record and will favorably presume that the test used was adequate for rating purposes.  See January 2020 VA medical opinion.  The examining clinician noted in a contemporaneous record that the Veteran's word recognition ability was poor, bilaterally, and noted he had "a severe hearing handicap and would benefit from stronger binaural hearing aids."

Applying these results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level IX in the right ear and Level XI in the left ear (rounded down to 91), resulting in a percent disability rating under DC 6100.  Applying the results to Table VII results in an 80 percent rating.  An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment was shown in both ears.  Application to Table VIA yields Level VI in the right ear and level IX in the left ear, equating to a lower rating of 40 percent.  Here, Table VI yields the highest rating based on these results.  These results support the assignment of an 80 percent rating from March 10, 2005.

03/28/2008	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	55	70	95	100	83.75	X

LEFT	65	75	85	105	91.25	X

This examination utilized the NU-6 word test that is inapplicable for rating purposes.  As there is no word score and as these results demonstrate an exceptional pattern of hearing loss, application of the results to Table VIA, yields a numeric designation of Level VIII in the right ear (rounding up to 84) and Level IX in the left ear (rounding down to 91).  Applying these bilateral numeric designations to Table VII, equates to a 50 percent disability rating.  

11/01/2011	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	55	75	100	100	82.5	X

LEFT	70	90	95	95	87.5	X

This treatment evaluation did not include speech scores.  See January 2020 VA examination, restatement of requested opinion.  A November 2011 VA audiology assessment note indicates that the Veteran's "hearing sensitivity is essentially unchanged from previous hearing evaluation 3/28/2008 with the exception of 250 Hz in the left ear which showed a 10 dB decrease in hearing sensitivity."  His word recognition had not improved.  As an exceptional pattern of hearing was again shown, application of the results to Table VIA, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level VII in the right ear (rounded up to 83) and Level VIII in the left ear (rounded up to 88).  Application to Table VII, equates to a 40 percent disability rating.  

The Board notes here that because the above test results from 2008 and 2011 do not include CNC word scores, and because there is no indication from the lay or medical evidence of record that the Veteran's hearing acuity actually improved following the 2005 test, the Board finds it would be inappropriate to use these results to assign lower disability ratings during this specific period.  Multiple VA clinicians have opined that the Veteran's hearing loss has been consistent and progressive throughout the period on appeal, and it would be nonsensical and inconsistent with applicable regulations to rely on these results for rating purposes.

Next, a May 2015 VA examination showed the following results:

05/21/2015	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	60	80	95	100	83.75	48

LEFT	65	90	105	105	91.25	12

The Veteran reported difficulty hearing and understanding speech, especially in background noise.  He noted difficulty hearing and communicating at work with coworkers, supervisors, and in staff meetings.  He had difficulty communicating over the telephone.  He felt that others misjudged his skills and abilities due to his hearing loss.  Applying, this data to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level IX in the right ear (rounding up to 84) and Level XI in the left ear (rounding down to 91).  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designations to Table VII, equates to an 80 percent rating.  

As an exceptional pattern of hearing was again shown, application of the results to Table VIA, provides a designation of Level VIII in the right ear and Level IX in the left ear.  Applying these results to Table VII, would equate to a 50 percent disability rating.  

A May 2017 examination for treatment purposes showed the following:

05/19/2017	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	55	70	100	100	81.25	X

LEFT	65	90	105	105	97.50	X

This treatment evaluation did not include speech scores.  See January 2020 VA examination, restatement of requested opinion.  As an exceptional pattern of hearing was again shown, application of the results to Table VIA, provides a designation of Level VII in the right ear (rounding down to 81) and Level X in the left ear (rounding up to 98).  Applying these results to Table VII, would equate to a 60 percent disability rating.  

In August 2018, the Veteran received another examination for rating purposes, which showed:

08/01/2018	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	60	65	100	100	81.25	32

LEFT	70	95	110	115	97.50	20

During this examination, the Veteran reported, "I can't hear in all situations whether it's TV, human speech, music, anything."  38 C.F.R. § 4.10; Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007).  Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level XI in the right ear (rounding down to 81) and Level XI in the left ear (rounding up to 98).  Applying the results to Table VIA, for exceptional patterns of hearing loss, yields Level VII in the right ear and Level X in the left ear, which would equate to a lower rating of 60 percent under Table VIA.

In considering the date from which to assign a 100 percent evaluation, the Board first acknowledges the Veteran's contention that because the 2018 examination was provided only after he filed a CUE claim on March 23, 2017, the March 2017 date should be the effective date of the increase.  See February 2020 Correspondence.  In past filings with the Court, OGC recognized that in the AOJ's July 2018, rating decision, it accepted the Veteran's March 23, 2017, statement as an intent to file benefits (and even used that date as the effective date for an increased rating for another service-connected condition).  

Because the instant increased rating appeal has been pending since 1999, the March 23, 2017, contentions are relevant to the Board for effective date purposes as an indicator as to when the Veteran's hearing may have worsened, even though a responsive medical examination did not occur for many months.  Further, the AOJ's acceptance of the March date as an intent to file is favorable to the Veteran.  In this case, the Board finds the March 23, 2017, lay statement and CUE claim to be evidence that the Veteran was seeking an appropriate rating for his deteriorating hearing acuity, which he clearly believed to have been worse than rated at the time he filed the claim.  Resolving all doubt on this issue in his favor, the Board finds the lay and medical evidence to support assignment of a 100 percent rating from March 23, 2017.  See Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 223 (2015).  

Based on the evidence above, the currently assigned 20 percent rating, must continue from July 28, 1999, to February 5, 2001.  From February 5, 2001, a disability rating of 50 percent is warranted.  From March 10, 2005, a disability rating of 80 percent, is warranted.  From March 23, 2017, a 100 percent disability rating is warranted.  Further, from March 23, 2017, entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k) for deafness is warranted.

In making the above findings, the Board expressly acknowledges it has considered lay evidence included in medical treatment records and as submitted directly by the Veteran when adjudicating this claim.  To the extent possible under the rating criteria, the Board has resolved doubt in favor of the Veteran.  See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).  The Board notes that the rating criteria contemplate speech reception thresholds and ability to hear spoken words on Maryland CNC testing.  The functional impact that the Veteran has described is contemplated by the rating criteria.  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017); Rossy v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 142, 145 (2017).  The Veteran is also now entitled to SMC(k) based on his 100 percent rating from an earlier effective date.  For completeness, it appears from the Veteran's April 2019 VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability that he ceased working at the end of September 30, 2007, and that he has been in receipt of unemployability benefits from October 1, 2007, due to his service-connected disabilities.  As such, a claim for an earlier effective date for unemployability benefits is not raised based on the date from which the Veteran reported having last worked. 

Accordingly, the Board finds the evidence of record in at least approximate balance as to whether higher disability ratings are warranted based on the audiometric and lay evidence outlined above.  To that extent, the Veteran's appeal is granted.  Similarly, ratings higher than designated above are not supported by the evidence of record, given the available rating criteria and specific audiometric data available for consideration.  See Lendenmann, 3 Vet. App. 345.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.
