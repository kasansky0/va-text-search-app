DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

An evaluation in excess of 30 percent for left kidney stone residuals with scar and chronic kidney disease is denied.

REMANDED

An evaluation in excess of 10 percent prior to December 15, 2023, for the removal of a rib is remanded.

An evaluation in excess of 20 percent beginning December 15, 2023, for the removal of a rib is remanded. 

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's left kidney stone with residual scar and chronic kidney disease does not manifest in GFR of less than 45 mL/min/1.73m2, or the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for left kidney stone residuals with scar and chronic kidney disease have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7508-7509.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1970 to September 1974.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in April 2023, August 2023, and March 2024.  They constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). These rating decisions each have separate evidence review and evaluation periods, as will be explained below.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the respective agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  Evidence was added after each rating decision on appeal.  Some of this evidence that was not considered by the Board because it falls outside a permissible evidence window.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.   The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  For the claims being remanded, the AOJ will consider the evidence on remand.

In his April 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran disagreed with a March 2021 rating decision that granted service connection for a rib resection effective January 2021.  He further disagreed with other rating decisions prior to the March 2021 decision.  The April 2024 Notice of Disagreement is untimely as to the March 2021 and earlier rating decisions because the NOD was filed more than a year following the notice of the rating decisions.  Therefore, the Board does not address the Veteran's disagreement with the March 2021 and earlier rating decisions.

Nonetheless, in November 2024, the Board issued a decision awarding an earlier effective date of April 2000 for the grant of service connection.  The Board decision arose from the Veteran's April 2021 Notice of Disagreement.  

Increased Ratings

The Board first reviews the rating decisions on appeal and the evidence review periods associated with them.

In March 2023, the Veteran filed a claim for increased ratings for his rib and kidney disabilities.  The April 2023 rating decision continued the 30 percent rating for the left kidney stone residuals with a scar and continued the 10 percent evaluation for removal of floating ribs.

In July 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for Compensation for increased rating for the removal of the floating rib. The August 2023 rating decision continued the 10 percent evaluation for removal of floating ribs.

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File, followed by a VA Form 21-526EZ claim.  The Veteran sought increased ratings for his kidney and rib disabilities.  He asserted he should be awarded a 100 percent evaluation.  The March 2024 rating decision continued both evaluations.

The Board is limited to reviewing the evidence of record at the time of each rating decision on appeal.  Generally, for the April 2023 rating decision, the Board is limited to reviewing the evidence of record as of April 19, 2023, for both the rib and kidney disabilities.  For the August 2023 rating decision, the Board is limited to reviewing the evidence of record as of August 13, 2023, with respect to the rib disability.  Finally, for the March 2024 rating decision, the Board is limited to reviewing the evidence of record as of March 8, 2024.  

In general, the date of claim for each rating decision affects the period for which an increased rating can begin.  In this case, that would result in separate review periods.  For the rib disability, the review periods are: March 2023 to April 2023; July 2023 to August 2023; and December 2023 to March 2024.  For the kidney disability, the review periods are March 2023 to April 2023 and December 2023 to March 2024.  

The evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision includes the evidence between the other two rating decisions and the March 2024 rating decision.  Further, increased rating rules permit a one-year lookback period for increases.  There is less than one year between the December 2023 claim and the March 2023 claim.  Due to the very short appeal periods for the April 2023 and August 2023 rating decisions, the Board will not attempt to separate the appeal periods in its evaluation.  Instead, it will treat the issues as increased ratings for the period from March 2023 to March 2024.  Therefore, the Board has recharacterized the issues from the several different rating decisions into the issues as described above.

An evaluation in excess of 30 percent for left kidney stone residuals with scar and chronic kidney disease.

The Veteran seeks a 100 percent evaluation for his disabilities.  He reports that his muscle was left weak after it was cut through to remove the kidney stone.  He also asserted that the water at Camp Lejeune added to his overall medical problems.  He further asserts that he was forced to retire due to problems caused by the water he drank for four years.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part IV.  If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's kidney disability is rated under Diagnostic Code 7508-7509.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  In this case, the rating for nephrolithiasis under Diagnostic Code 7508 requires Diagnostic code 7509 for hydronephrosis as the basis for the evaluation.

Diagnostic Code 7508 provides, under the rating criteria effective November 14, 2021, nephrolithiasis/ureterolithiasis/ nephrocalcinosis are rated as hydronephrosis, except for recurrent stone formation requiring invasive or non-invasive procedures more than two times/year, which are evaluated as 30 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7508.

Diagnostic Code 7509 for hydronephrosis, which was not amended, provides a 10 percent rating for only an occasional attack of colic, not infected and not requiring catheter drainage.  A 20 percent rating is warranted when there are frequent attacks of colic, requiring catheter drainage.  A maximum 30 percent evaluation is warranted when there are frequent attacks of colic with infection (pyonephrosis), with impaired kidney function.  If hydronephrosis is severe, it is rated as renal dysfunction. 

Under the criteria for renal dysfunction effective November 14, 2021, chronic kidney disease with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or requiring regular routine dialysis; or eligible kidney transplant recipient warrants a 100 percent rating.  Chronic kidney disease with GFR from 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months warrants an 80 percent rating.  Chronic kidney disease with GFR from 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months warrants a 60 percent evaluation.  Chronic kidney disease with GFR from 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months warrants a 30 percent evaluation.  A note to the criteria states that GFR, estimated GFR (eGFR), and creatinine-based approximations of GFR will be accepted for evaluation purposes under this section when determined to be appropriate and calculated by a medical professional. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

Currently, the Veteran has the maximum 30 percent evaluation under Diagnostic Codes 7508 and 7509 without using the criteria for renal dysfunction.  The question before the Board is whether the Veteran had renal dysfunction that manifested as chronic kidney disease with GFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months, or if he required routine dialysis or was an eligible kidney transplant recipient.

At the March 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported being diagnosed with a left kidney stone around 1974 while on activity duty.  He stated that he continued to have kidney stones, the last one being the prior month.  He also reported having cysts on his kidneys.  The Veteran was not taking continuous medication.  Symptoms were reported as recurrent kidney stones.

The examiner found the Veteran did not have renal dysfunction.  The examiner reported the Veteran had a history of recurrent symptomatic urinary tract or kidney infections of an unknown etiology.  These required hospitalizations one or two times per year and oral antibiotics.  The examiner reported GFR of 75 mL/min/1.73 on the laboratory tests taken March 27, 2023.  The examiner noted that result was normal. The examiner found the kidney disability did not impact his ability to perform any type of occupational task. 

A January 2024 VA kidney conditions examination was conducted.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran's condition as post operative left kidney stone with residual scar with chronic kidney disease stage IIIa.  The examiner found the Veteran has renal dysfunction, but does not require dialysis.  There were no attacks of colic due to obstruction other than upper urinary tract urolithiasis.  The examiner found the treatment for recurrent stone formation was most recently performed in 1974.  The Veteran did not have any signs or symptoms due to upper urinary tract urolithiasis, according to the examiner.  Laboratory tests conducted in conjunction with the examination show normal BUN, high creatinine of 1.55, normal RBCs/HPF, normal protein, and GFR of 47.  The examiner found that the diagnosis of post operative left kidney stone with residual scar is changed to include the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD).  The examiner noted that the signs and symptoms due to renal dysfunction are decreased renal function.

The GFR results under each VA examination were not less than 45 mL/min/1.73m2.  The Veteran did not have renal dysfunction at the March 2023 examination.  The January 2024 examination shows he does not require dialysis.  There is no indication he would require or be eligible for a kidney transplant.  Accordingly, the VA examination evidence is against a rating greater than 30 percent under the renal dysfunction criteria.

Treatment records also show no GFR results lower than 45.  Private treatment records in March 2022 and February 2023 show eGFR greater than or equal to 60.  VA treatment records for July 2023 show eGFR was 60.82.  In November 2023 it was 76.7.  In February 2024 it was 75.8.  

The Board notes that the Veteran stated in his April 2024 Notice of Disagreement that an area of disagreement was "service connection."  The Board notes that the Veteran has already been awarded service connection for this disability.  Therefore, any argument related to obtaining service connection, such as the connection of his disabilities to the water at Camp Lejeune, are no longer relevant.  The relevant evidence and arguments at this point are the severity of the disabilities, not how they arose.

Based on the foregoing, the criteria are not met nor more nearly approximated for a rating higher than 30 percent for the Veteran's kidney stones with chronic kidney disease.

Scar

A component of the Veteran's evaluation for his kidney disability is the surgical scar associated with the in-service removal of the kidney stone.  The Board will now review whether a separate compensable evaluation is warranted.

Scars are rated under Diagnostic Codes 7800 to 7805, depending on their characteristics, such as burn scars, nonlinear scars, and scars of the head, face, or neck.  In this case, the Veteran's scar is linear and from surgery and it not of the head face or neck.  The Board thus, first looks at Diagnostic Code 7804 for unstable or painful scar(s).

Under Diagnostic Code 7804, one or two scars that are unstable or painful scars warrants a 10 percent rating.  Three or four scars that are unstable or painful scars warrants a 20 percent rating.  Five or more scars that are unstable or painful warrants a 30 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 7804 instructs that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  Id.  

A March 2023 VA scars examination shows the Veteran has a left abdominal surgical scar.  The examiner found the scar was not painful or unstable, and it did not have frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  The scar measured 28 cm by 0.5 cm.  The area of the scar was 14 square cm.

The August 2023 VA scars examination reported the Veteran's scar was not painful or unstable, and it did not have frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  The scar measured 25 cm by .2cm.  The scar was not tender to palpation.

The January 2024 VA scars examination reported the Veteran's scar was not painful or unstable, and it did not have frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  The scar is measured 9 cm by .3 cm.

Nonetheless, the August 2023 VA bones examination showed that the Veteran had mild tenderness at the left lateral inferior ribs.  

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7804 because the Veteran's scar is not manifest by one or two scars that are unstable or painful.  Although the August 2023 bones examination showed tenderness over the area near where the scar is, it is not clear that the examiner was addressing tenderness to the scar itself or the area in general.  The scars examinations, however, are clear that they are addressing the scar itself.  There were three scars examinations since the March 2023 claim.  The number and specificity of these examinations persuasively outweighs the finding of tenderness on the one examination. 

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars.  However, the Veteran's scar is not of the head, face, or neck, is not deep and nonlinear, and is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  Although it is superficial and not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, it does not cover an area or areas of 144 square inches or greater.  Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7800 through 7802 are inapplicable.  Finally, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 as contemplated under both pre- and post-August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7805.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects.  Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms.  However, the Veteran has not reported that his scar is painful, unstable, or that there are any other disabling effects.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a higher rating for his kidney disability with scar.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for the scar, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. An evaluation in excess of 10 percent prior to December 15, 2023, for the removal of a rib is remanded.

2. An evaluation in excess of 20 percent beginning December 15, 2023, for the removal of a rib is remanded.

Remand is necessary for an adequate medical examination during the claim period beginning December 15, 2023.  Remand for the period prior to December 2023 is warranted because the issue is inextricably intertwined with the evidence developed on remand for the period beginning December 2023.  

The Veteran seeks a 100 percent evaluation for his disabilities.  He reports that his muscle was left weak after it was cut through to remove the kidney stone.  He also asserted that the water at Camp Lejeune added to his overall medical problems.  He further asserts that he was forced to retire due to problems caused by the water he drank for four years.

The Veteran's rib disability has been rated under Diagnostic Code 5297, which relates to the removal of ribs.  Under Diagnostic Code 5297, a 10 percent rating is warranted for the removal of one rib or the resection of two or more ribs without regeneration. Higher ratings, up to a maximum 50 percent, are warranted when there has been the removal of two or more ribs. 38 C.F.R. §4.71a.  The provisions under 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, and 4.59 with respect to painful motion do not pertain to Diagnostic Code 5297 because that diagnostic code does not rate based on limitation of motion. See Johnson v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 7, 11 (1996).  

Pertaining to his March 2023 claim, the Veteran was afforded a March 2023 VA bone conditions examination.  At that examination, the Veteran reported increased pain in left side and states that he was told that he had arthritis.  The examiner found the Veteran had one rib removed and cited a March 2021 bilateral rib x-ray to confirm the finding.  The examiner found no benign or malignant tumor related to this disability.

In conjunction with his July 2023 claim, the Veteran underwent an August 2023 VA examination.  At this examination, the Veteran reported having a left kidney stone removed while on active duty.  He reported that during the process, the clinicians noted an unusual appearing rib, which was removed.  The Veteran reported doing well until 2013 when he developed pain overlying the previous incision site.  His current symptoms were burning sensation to sharp pain.  Treatments included Percocet and Gabapentin.  The examiner noted that one rib was removed.

In conjunction with his January 2024 claim (initiated by a December 2023 Intent to File), the Veteran underwent a January 2024 VA bone conditions examination. At this examination, the Veteran reported developing a left kidney stone in 1974 that was so big that he needed surgery to remove it. During the surgery, it was found that he had rib cancer involving the last 2 floating ribs, which were removed, he reported.  The examiner reported that two ribs were removed and that the Veteran had a malignancy.  The examiner stated that there were no diagnostic tests associated with the examination.

The Board finds that the January 2024 VA examination is inadequate.  The examiner did not address the March 2021 X-ray report showing only 1 rib removed.  Furthermore, the Veteran's service treatment records show that only the 12th rib was resected.  More importantly, laboratory testing on the resected rib was normal.  Thus, the Veteran's report about cancer is not accurate.  It appears the examiner merely took the Veteran's report at face value.  Because the examination is not factually accurate, the Veteran has not received an adequate VA examination associated with his January 2024 claim.  Accordingly, remand is warranted.

3. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability is remanded.

The Veteran raised the issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) in his April 2024 VA Form 10182.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) In a statement in that form connected with his kidney disability, the Veteran asserted that he was forced to retire early due to problems cuased by the water he drank for years at Camp Lejeune.  The AOJ should develop the issue and consider the issue in connection with the claims on appeal, not as a new claim.

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Ask the Veteran to complete a TDIU claim form.  

2. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of the service-connected 12th rib removal.  The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria, and the examiner should elicit from the Veteran the complete educational, vocational, and employment history and should note any complaints regarding the impact of the resected rib on employment.  

Although an independent review of the claims file is required, the examiner's attention is called to the July 1974 operative report in service and a March 2021 x-ray showing one rib removed; and a July 1974 tissue examination report of the resected rib showing it was grossly normal.
