ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) disability, secondary to the service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) disability, to include obesity as an intermediate step, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service-connected mental health condition caused him to become obese, resulting in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Army from October 2008 to April 2009 and from March 2020 to May 2011.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for an obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) disability, secondary to a service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) disability, is granted. 

The Veteran contends that his mental health condition caused him to become obese, which subsequently resulted in his obstructive sleep apnea. 

Entitlement to service connection requires evidence of three elements: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (2007).

Also, a Veteran may establish service connection on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Or for any increase in the severity of a nonservice-connected disease or injury that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progression of the nonservice-connected disease.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b).

Entitlement to service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) or (b) requires evidence of three elements: (1) evidence of a current disability that is not service-connected; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) evidence of nexus establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

Obesity may serve as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service connected on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a).  Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020); see also VAOGCPREC 1-2017.  In such a case, the evidence would need to reflect that (1) a service-connected disability or disabilities caused the Veteran to become obese or aggravated the Veteran's obesity, (2) the obesity or aggravation of obesity resulting from service-connected disability or disabilities was a substantial factor in causing another disability, and (3) the disability would not have occurred but for the obesity caused by the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities or the obesity is aggravated by the service-connected disability or disabilities.  Walsh, 32 Vet. App. at 306-7.

In order to prevail on a claim for benefits, the Veteran need only demonstrate the evidence is approximately balanced.  This is because the Veteran is entitled to the "benefit of the doubt" when the evidence is approximately balanced, which means nearly equal evidence.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Initially, the Board observes that the AOJ found the Veteran has been diagnosed with OSA.  The AOJ also noted the Veteran has been service connected for post traumatic stress disorder.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Thus, the only remaining issue is whether a nexus can be established. 

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a private opinion regarding his OSA.  The private examiner noted the Veteran's service-connected right knee, lower back, and mental health conditions.  The examiner also noted that the Veteran's BMI was 50, which classified as medically obese.   Citing various studies related to OSA, the examiner opined that the Veteran's acquired mental health condition, right knee condition and lower back condition caused him to become obese, which, in turn, caused the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea.  The Board finds this opinion probative.  

The Board notes the record contains two negative opinions regarding the Vetera's OSA.  Critically, neither of these opinions considered whether the Veteran's obesity served as an intermediate step to his OSA.  As such, the Board affords these opinions no probative value. 

Ultimately, the weight of the persuasive evidence favors the Veteran's claim for secondary service connection entitlement for an OSA disability.  Accordingly, this service-connection claim must be granted.
