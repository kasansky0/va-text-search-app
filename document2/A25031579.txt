DOCKET NO. 230921-379206
DATE:  April 7, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis is dismissed. 

The appeal as to entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for right lower extremity sciatica is dismissed. 

The appeal as to entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for left lower extremity sciatica is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

There is currently no justiciable case or controversy for active consideration by the Board as to these claims in the present appeal, as the Board, in a separate decision, has granted earlier effective dates of August 27, 2019, for the awards of service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis, right lower extremity sciatica, and left lower extremity sciatica.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

As the benefit sought on appeal has been granted in full, there no longer remains a case or controversy concerning the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis, right lower extremity sciatica, and left lower extremity sciatica; the issues are dismissed as moot.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1988 to September 1992.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2023, Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  In that rating decision, the RO denied entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis, left lower extremity sciatic, and right lower extremity sciatic. 

In September 2023, VA received the Veteran's 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD). The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

The Direct Review docket does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Thus, as this is a Direct Review appeal, the record closed as of the March 2023 rating decision.

Evidence added during an ineligible period will not be considered.  Should the Veteran want VA to consider evidence submitted outside the eligible period, the Veteran should submit a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, identifying such evidence.

The Veteran's service-connected degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis was initially awarded service connection in an August 2022 rating decision.  The RO granted service connection for right lower extremity sciatica and left lower extremity sciatica in a November 2022 rating decision.  The assigned effective date for each award of service connection of these claims was July 16, 2021, the date of receipt of a July 16, 2021 Supplemental Claim.  However, prior to the August 2022 and November 2022 rating decisions, the Veteran submitted an April 2021 VA Form 10182 NOD, properly appealing the June 2020 rating decision that denied the initial claims of entitlement to service connection, to the Board.  The Board, in a separate decision under that appeal stream (#210421-516112), has adjudicated these claims, granting them in full.  Accordingly, given that there are no remaining allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration in the present appeal, the appeal as to these issues is dismissed as moot.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.
