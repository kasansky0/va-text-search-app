DOCKET NO. 230922-378921
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for an effective date earlier than August 2, 2019, for the award of service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is dismissed.  

REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating prior to August 4, 2022, and in excess of 10 percent thereafter for hiatal hernia with GERD associated with hiatal hernia is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The August 2022 rating decision was not continuously pursued as to the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date assigned to award of service connection for GERD; and the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date in the September 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement is therefore a "freestanding claim" for an earlier effective date.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for GERD have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; Calhoun v. McDonough, No. 21-6125; see also Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1990 to June 1991 and from November 1993 to November 1996.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

Within the framework of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), in September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) in response to the July 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision and elected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d).  The July 2023 HLR decision on appeal considered the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 decision.  Therefore, under the direct review option, the Board will only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 rating decision.  It may consider argument, but not evidence, that was received at any time after the January 2023 rating decision.

By way of background, in August 1999, the RO granted service connection for hiatal hernia, assigning a noncompensable rating, effective February 18, 1999.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision or submit new and material evidence within one year and it became final.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

On August 2, 2019, the Veteran submitted an intent to file.  Within a year from the intent to file, in December 2019, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ for entitlement to service connection for GERD.  Service connection for the Veteran's GERD was granted in an August 2022 rating decision, which was added to the Veteran's already service-connected hiatal hernia to be evaluated together based on the same manifestations of symptoms to avoid pyramiding, with a noncompensable rating, setting the effective date as August 2, 2019, the date the Veteran filed his intent to file.  

In an August 3, 2022 notice to the Veteran of the August 2022 decision, the AOJ provided directions to the Veteran and his representative as to how to proceed if the Veteran disagreed with the decision.  In accordance with the regulations referenced above, the AOJ explained that the Veteran could seek review within one year by submitting a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, or a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  

Subsequently, in a January 2023 rating decision, the Veteran's evaluation of hiatal hernia with GERD was increased to 10 percent, effective August 4, 2022.  In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, appealing the August 2022 rating decision and the January 2023 rating decision as to the evaluations assigned to the service-connected hiatal hernia with GERD.  In a July 2023 HLR rating decision, the RO considered the evidence at the time of the January 2023 rating decision, and denied the increased rating claim.  

In September 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, appealing the January 2023 and July 2023 rating decisions.  He expressed disagreement to the ratings assigned and also stated that he wanted an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for GERD.

The Board acknowledges that the July 2023 HLR rating decision did not address the matter of entitlement to an earlier effective date.  However, as will be explained below, as this particular claim must be denied as a matter of law, no benefit would result from remanding the claim for initial AOJ consideration and dismissal is appropriate.  

The Board also acknowledges that prior to the Veteran's submission of the March 2023 HLR request, he had submitted a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) in August 2022 also requesting an increased rating for the service-connected hiatal hernia with GERD.  Under the AMA, a claim can be continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, specifically a higher-level review, a supplemental claim, or an appeal to the Board within one year from the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues a notice of a decision on a claim or issue.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a) and (c).  If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  An initial claim for an increased rating on VA Form 21-526EZ cannot establish continuous pursuit, regardless of whether it was received within one year of the issuance of the prior VA decision.  Id.   

Nevertheless, resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, considering the Veteran had submitted a HLR request that specifically identified he was disagreeing to the August 2022 rating decision that awarded service connection for GERD regarding to the rating assigned, the Board will find that he has continuously pursued a higher initial rating for the service-connected hiatal hernia with GERD following the August 2022 rating decision.  As such, the Board has characterized the increased rating issue on appeal as an initial increased rating claim.  The Board will address the rating assigned for this disability during the period dating back to the August 2, 2019 effective date of service connection, as opposed to the later August 4, 2022 date (the date considered if based on the August 2022 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation)).  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  Under the circumstances of this specific case, the Board waives any claims processing violation as to this particular increased rating claim issue.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the earlier effective date claim for the award of service connection for GERD, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on this particular claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, as the Board is remanding the increased rating claim for the service-connected hernia with GERD for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of this claim.

Effective Date

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 2, 2019, for the award of service connection for GERD.

In Rudd v. Nicholson, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court/CAVC) held that Veterans are prohibited from collaterally attacking a prior final decision by filing a freestanding earlier effective date claim.  The Court specifically held that, once a decision has become final, a claimant may not properly file, and VA has no authority to adjudicate, freestanding earlier effective date claim to overcome the finality of a decision.  The Court reasoned that to allow such claims would vitiate the rule of finality.  See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299.  The only way to modify the effective date for a service connection issue after the appeal period is by asserting clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a prior final decision.  38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a).

In Calhoun v. McDonough, No. 21-6125 (2024), CAVC addressed a similar situation in the AMA system.  Under the AMA appeal system, an effective date can be based on the date a claim was first submitted if the issue is continuously pursued through one of the review avenues allowed under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2).

The Board reiterates that under the AMA, a Veteran may continuously pursue a claim or issue by timely filing a request for higher-level review, a supplemental claim, or an appeal to the Board within one year from the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues a notice of a decision on a claim or issue.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a) and (c).  If a claim is continuously pursued, then the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the receipt date for the initial claim or the date when entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

As previously indicated, the Veteran's March 2023 filing is accepted only as a claim for an increased rating in response to the August 2022 rating decision that awarded service-connection for GERD.  The Board finds this is the proper interpretation of this claim, filed on a March 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, in which the Veteran specifically indicated he was disagreeing with the disability evaluation assigned to his service-connected hiatal hernia with GERD.  If the Veteran intended to disagree with the effective date assigned for the grant of service connection, he needed to file one of the appropriate review options allowed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the August 2022 rating decision (higher-level review, supplemental claim, or Board appeal), specifying he was disagreeing with the assigned effective date on the appropriate form.  As the Veteran did not file one of these review options within one year of the August 2022 rating decision and express disagreement with the effective date assigned until the September 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran did not continuously pursue the August 2022 rating decision as to the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date.  Id. 

The Board has considered the Veteran's correspondence in April 2023 in which he reported that he had been dealing with GERD since 1991, listing the symptoms and impact the condition had on his life.  Notwithstanding that the Board does not find that the Veteran specified in the April 2023 correspondence that he was claiming entitlement to an earlier effective date assigned to his service-connected GERD in the August 2022 rating decision, the Board notes that standardized claims and appeals forms have been in effect even before the implementation of AMA.  Specifically, under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a), to initiate an appeal under AMA, a Notice of Disagreement must be properly completed on a form prescribed by the Secretary within one year of the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision, a (i) supplemental claim, (ii) higher-level review (HLR), or (iii) VA Form 10182, Board appeal, that adequately identifies the issue appealed.  This is not the case with the aforementioned correspondence, associated with the claims file in April 2023, and thus it cannot initiate an appeal as to entitlement to an earlier effective date.

If the Veteran believes that a CUE occurred in a prior decision, the Veteran is free to file the appropriate motion.  The motion must clearly identify the specific decision which contains error, identify the specific issue within that decision, and provide persuasive reasons why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error.  However, as it stands, the Board cannot adjudicate the Veteran's earlier effective date claim without violating the Court's express prohibition in Rudd and Calhoun against freestanding earlier effective date claims.  See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 296; see also Calhoun, No. 21-6125.

As there is no legal entitlement to an effective date earlier than that assigned, the earlier effective claim must be dismissed as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating prior to August 4, 2022, and in excess of 10 percent thereafter for hiatal hernia with GERD associated with hiatal hernia is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that an increased rating is warranted for his service-connected hiatal hernia with GERD associated with hiatal hernia because the assigned ratings does not reflect the severity of the disability. 

Service connection for the Veteran's GERD was granted in an August 2022 rating decision, which was added to the Veteran's already service-connected hiatal hernia to be evaluated together based on the same manifestations of symptoms to avoid pyramiding, with a noncompensable rating, effective August 2, 2019 (the beginning of the current appeal period).  

In assigning a disability rating, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medications where such effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria.  Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).  The Veteran's hiatal hernia with GERD associated with hiatal hernia (hereinafter "gastrointestinal disability") has been rated by analogy under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7399-7346, as 0 percent disabling from prior to August 4, 2022, and 10 percent disabling thereafter.  At the time of the July 2023 rating decision, the schedule of ratings for the digestive system did not contain a diagnostic code specifically addressing GERD.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114.  Here, the Veteran's service-connected gastrointestinal disability has been rated pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7346, which does not contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication and, therefore, such effects must be discounted in evaluating the severity of the disability.

(The Board is aware VA revised the schedule of ratings for the digestive system (38 C.F.R. § 4.114), effective May 19, 2024.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 19,735 (Mar. 20, 2024).  One revision was the creation of a specific DC for GERD, DC 7206.  DC 7346 was also amended.  In the context of this decision, the Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise.  See Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).)

The most recent VA esophageal conditions examination of record was obtained in September 2022 and reflects that the Veteran's treatment plan includes taking continuous medication for his gastrointestinal disability.  It is unclear to the Board whether the VA examiner considered the ameliorative effects of the Veteran's GERD medication in describing the severity of his symptoms.  Accordingly, the Board finds the September 2022 VA examination to be inadequate and that remand is warranted for a new VA examination that clearly evaluates the severity of the Veteran's gastrointestinal symptoms without consideration of the ameliorative effects of his medication.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311-12 (2007) (holding that once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, VA must ensure that the examination provided is adequate).  Considering the medical examination obtained in this case is inadequate to rely upon for adjudication, such failure constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error necessitating a remand for correction of the error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the severity of his service-connected hiatal hernia with GERD associated with hiatal hernia, without considering the ameliorative effects of medications used to treat his service-connected gastrointestinal disability.  

(A) The examiner must elicit a complete history from the Veteran regarding relevant symptoms during examination, to include from 2019 to present.  

(B) After obtaining the Veteran's reported symptoms during the entire period on appeal, the examiner is to opine as to whether, when not considering the ameliorative effects of medication, the Veteran's service-connected gastrointestinal disability would have been productive of:

(i.) Symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptoms productive of severe impairment of health.

(ii.) Persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health; or,

(iii.) Two or more of the above-noted symptoms (persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, regurgitation, substernal arm or shoulder pain), productive of less than considerable impairment of health.

(C) If the Veteran's gastrointestinal disability has undergone variations in severity (i.e., improved or worsened) over the review period, beginning August 2, 2019, the examiner should indicate which period(s) are associated with each level of severity.

A complete and thorough rationale must be provided for all opinions.  In forming the opinion, the examiner must consider and address all relevant lay statements of record.  If the examiner is unable to offer the opinions requested, he or she must explain in detail why that is the case.

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to attest to matters of which he has had first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation.

The Board does not, at this time or by this remand, make any determination, express or implied, concerning the credibility of any statements on file.

If the examiner cannot provide the requested opinion without resorting to speculation, it must be so stated, and the examiner must provide the reasons why an opinion would require speculation.  The examiner must indicate whether there was any further need for information or testing necessary to make a determination.  The examiner must indicate whether an opinion could not be rendered due to limitations of knowledge in the medical community at large and not those of the particular examiner.
