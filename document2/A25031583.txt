DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, as due to exposure to herbicide agents is granted on a direct basis.

Entitlement to service connection for left jaw cancer, as due to exposure to herbicide agents is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

1. Resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the diagnosed hypertension is etiologically related to the presumed exposure to herbicide agents during service.

2. A current diagnosis of jaw cancer is not shown.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension as due to exposure to herbicide agents are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria to establish service connection for jaw cancer are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to June 1970.

As pertinent here, VA received the Veteran's original service connection claims for hypertension and left jaw cancer in January 2015.  The claims were denied in a September 2015 rating decision.  The Veteran submitted a timely notice of disagreement in April 2016 under the legacy appeal system, and the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued a Statement of the Case in January 2020.  The Veteran opted-in to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) framework by submitting a March 2020 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR).

An August 2020 HLR rating decision reconsidered but denied the claims.  The Veteran submitted an April 2021 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, electing the Evidence Submission docket.  In December 2022, the Board remanded the appeal for further development.  Thereafter, October 2023 and February 2024 rating decisions deferred a decision regarding the claimed hypertension and left jaw cancer. 

An October 2024 rating decision again reconsidered but denied the claims.  

In the December 19, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or attorney with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

The Board acknowledges the Court's holding in Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), that "because the regulation gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the AOJ mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up."  Although this period has not passed, the Veteran's attorney submitted additional evidence in connection with the appeal in December 2024 and a docket switch is now precluded.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2).

Service Connection - Applicable Laws and Regulations

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service.? 38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).? Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).? 

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.? Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

The Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence that it finds persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24?Vet. App.?428, 433 (2011).  This includes weighing the credibility and probative value of lay evidence against the remaining evidence of record.  See King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Kahana, 24 Vet. App. at 433-34. 

A claimant bears the evidentiary burden to establish all elements of a service connection claim, including the nexus requirement.  Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2009). 

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event.? 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §?3.102.? The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination.? See?Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021); Ortiz?v.?Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Service Connection for Hypertension - Evidence and Analysis

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

On review, the Board finds that the evidence is in relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran's hypertension is etiologically related to his exposure to herbicide agents during service.  

There is evidence of a current disability as the medical evidence shows a current diagnosis of hypertension.  

Moreover, the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents while stationed in Korea.  See July 2024 toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) Memorandum.

The Board notes further that in the "Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 11 (2018)," the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) found that there was "sufficient" evidence of an association between hypertension and exposure to herbicide agents used during the Vietnam War.  The undersigned finds this study highly probative.  Based on the foregoing, and after resolution of any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the evidence is in relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed hypertension is etiologically related to his exposure to herbicide agents during service.

The Board recognizes that, on August 10, 2022, the President signed into law the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (to be codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 136 Stat. 1759 (2022).  In pertinent part, this law added hypertension to the list of diseases acknowledged to be presumptively related to exposure to herbicide agents, effective October 1, 2026, with certain specified exceptions to the listed effective if the claimant is determined to be terminally ill, homeless, under extreme financial hardship, more than 85 years old, or capable of demonstrating other sufficient cause. 

While presumptive service connection for hypertension is warranted pursuant to the PACT Act, the award herein of service connection for hypertension on a direct basis is more favorable to the Veteran.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.  

The appeal is granted.

Service Connection for Jaw Cancer - Evidence and Analysis

The Veteran generally asserts that service connection for jaw cancer as due to exposure to herbicide agents is warranted.

Although the Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents is established, the Board finds that the threshold element of the claim for service connection, i.e., a current disability, is not met.  In this regard, the Veteran has not presented competent evidence showing he currently has jaw cancer.  That is, there is no competent evidence of jaw cancer diagnosis from the date of this claim and during the pendency of the appeal.

Review of the available medical records shows no complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of jaw cancer.  Jaw cancer is not mentioned at all by any medical record.  The only reference to the jaw is the Veteran's lay reports to VA medical professionals that he had arthritis in his jaw and hands.  See e.g., December 2014 VA treatment records.  To-date, the Veteran has not identified nor provided any medical evidence that confirms a diagnosis of jaw cancer.  Neither the Veteran nor his attorney provided any evidence or argument in support of the appeal.

While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay assertions and his belief that he has jaw cancer that is related to exposure to herbicide agents during service, he is a lay person, and under the facts of this case, is not shown to possess the necessary medical knowledge and expertise to make such determination.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376, n. 4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Under McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), in initial service connection claims, the VA must provide a VA medical examination where there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service; (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service; and (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for VA to make a decision on the claim.  Here, the claim contains no competent evidence of a current diagnosis of jaw cancer or any persistent or recurrent symptoms of the disability.  A mere conclusory generalized lay statement that military service caused the claimant's current condition is insufficient to require an examination under McLendon.  See also Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274 (2010), 601 F.3d at 1278-79 (rejecting appellant's argument that his "conclusory generalized statement that his service illness caused his present medical problems was enough to entitle him to a medical examination under the standard of [38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d)(b)(B).]").  Accordingly, a VA examination is not warranted in this case.

The Board concludes that the Veteran has not presented competent evidence showing that he has a current diagnosis of jaw cancer during the pendency of the appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (a) ("[A] claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits."); Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that it is the claimant's general evidentiary burden to establish all elements of the claim).  The medical evidence outweighs the lay evidence in this case.  Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service connection to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 255 (1992).  In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim.  Id.

The Board notes that in Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), the Federal Circuit held that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."  Id. at 1367-69.  Pain is not at issue under the facts of this case, and the Veteran has not identified any symptoms related to the claimed jaw cancer let alone those resulting in the requisite level of a functional impairment of earning capacity.  

Because the evidence is persuasively against the claim for service connection for jaw cancer, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  

The appeal is denied.
