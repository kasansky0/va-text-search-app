FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's GERD is related to his active duty service.

2.  The evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's asthma is related to his active duty service.

3.  The evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea had its onset during his active duty service.

4.  Audiological testing shows that the Veteran had no more than Level I hearing loss in both ears throughout the entire appeal period. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for GERD are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2.  With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for asthma are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3.  With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for sleep apnea are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4.  The criteria?for?an increased?compensable?disability?for?bilateral?hearing?loss are not met at any point during the appeal period.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.10, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6100. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1995 to November 1999.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from July 2023, December 2023, January 2024, and March 2024 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that, among other things, confirmed and continued the previous denials of the claims of service connection for GERD, asthma, and sleep apnea, denied the claims of service connection for low back joint pain and shoulder joint pain, and continued the noncompensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss.  The Board is bound by the favorable findings in the decisions that the Veteran has diagnoses of GERD, asthma, and sleep apnea, and was subjected to toxic exposure based on confirmed service in Bosnia.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran timely appealed the July 2023, December 2023, January 2024, and March 2024 rating decisions in a July 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) (VA Form 10182) and selected direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(b)(1).  Accordingly, the Board will review the evidence of record as of the date of the July 2023, December 2023, January 2024, and March 2024 rating decisions, including evidence associated with the claims file while the record was closed because the GERD, asthma, and sleep apnea claims were pending adjudication after identification of a duty to assist error during Higher-Level Review.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103(c)(2)(ii), 20.301.  The Board will not consider evidence added to the record after the dates of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  If evidence was added during any ineligible period, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, he may at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

The Board notes that the Veteran indicated in his July 2024 VA Form 10182 that he was also appealing an April 2023 rating decision that denied the claim of service connection for hypertension, a May 2017 rating decision that denied the claim of service connection for toe fungal condition, and a June 2008 rating decision that denied the claim of service connection for right knee condition.  However, these issues are not currently on appeal here as the July 2024 VA Form 10182 was submitted more than one year after the above discussed rating decisions denying the claims, and the Veteran has not argued and the evidence does not reflect that there is a basis for waiving this important and mandatory claims processing rule or that there was good cause for an extension under 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).  Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262, 269 (2024) ("The Board thus erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of Mr. Ferko's appeal because his NOD was not filed within section 7105(b)'s one-year period.  This doesn't mean, however, that the one-year deadline is irrelevant.  It is an "important and mandatory" component of section 7105(b)'s claim-processing rule.  Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. 428, 435 (2011).  Such a claim-processing rule would be subject to waiver or forfeiture, but if the "mandatory claim-processing rule" is properly invoked, it "must be enforced."  Hamer v. Neighborhood Hous. Servs., 583 U.S. 17, 20, 138 S. Ct. 13, 199 L. Ed. 2d 249 (2017).  Hence, VA need not accept an NOD filed outside that one-year period unless a claimant establishes an adequate excuse for the NOD's untimeliness"); id. at 271 (38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) "sets forth a well-established regulatory standard for seeking acceptance of an untimely NOD").

The Veteran also indicated in the July 2024 VA Form 10182 that he was appealing a February 2023 rating decision that denied a compensable disability rating for bilateral hearing loss.  However, this rating decision led to a Request for Higher-Level Review and the December 2023 rating decision that is on appeal here, as noted above, and is not currently on appeal. 

Finally, it has been more than one year since the AOJ's March 12, 2024 notification of the decision in regard to the claims of service connection for GERD and asthma and more than 60 days since the July 25, 2024 NOD, and there is no basis for delay of issuance of a decision in this case.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024) ("because [38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2)] gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the AOJ mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the NOD to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up"). 

Entitlement to service connection for GERD, asthma, and sleep apnea

The Veteran contends that he has experienced continuous GERD, asthma, and sleep-related symptoms, to include snoring, an inability to breath, and choking both in and since separation from service as a result of toxic exposure related activities (TERA) in Bosnia.  Given that service connection is being granted on a direct basis for the claims, and there is no indication that the grants of service connection based on any other theory of entitlement would result in an earlier effective date, the Board will not address any other theory of entitlement in connection with the claims.  See Johnson v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-7589, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 383 (Mar. 26, 2025) (indicating that effective date consequences can be considered by the Board in cases in which the issue before it is entitlement to service connection).

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For the following reasons, entitlement to service connection for GERD, asthma, and sleep apnea is warranted.

The Board is bound by the favorable findings in the January and March 2024 rating decisions that the Veteran has diagnoses of GERD, asthma, and sleep apnea.  Thus, the Veteran meets the current disability requirement for the claims.

The Board is bound by the favorable finding in the January 2024 rating decision that the Veteran was subjected to TERA while deployed to Bosnia.  Therefore, the Veteran meets the in-service injury requirement for the claims.

The Veteran has reported throughout the entire appeal period that he experienced continuous GERD, asthma, and sleep-related symptoms, to include snoring, an inability to breath, and choking, both in and since separation from service.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (holding lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence).  The Veteran's reports are credible and therefore competent as they have been consistent throughout the appeal period.

In addition, the Veteran's statements indicating sleep-related symptoms, such as snoring, an inability to breath, and choking, both in and since separation from service, combined with the diagnosis of sleep apnea, are sufficient to establish that the Veteran's sleep apnea had its onset in service.  Furthermore, as was reasoned in Maples v. Wilkie, No. 18-2016 (Vet. App. Feb. 11, 2019), sleep apnea is the type of disability for which lay evidence can be sufficient to support a claim for service connection for sleep apnea.  Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).

Further, a March 2024 VA opinion found that the Veteran's asthma was at least as likely as not related to TERA in service given that exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and some pesticides are associated with an increased risk of asthma.  This opinion is entitled to some probative weight when reading the opinion as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record as the nurse practitioner explained the reasons for the conclusion based on an accurate characterization of the evidence of record.  Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning).

August 2023 and December 2023 VA opinions that found that the Veteran's GERD and sleep apnea were less likely than not caused by TERA in service are inadequate given that they did not consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding continuous GERD and sleep apnea symptoms both in and since separation from service, and, in any event, did not address whether sleep apnea had its onset in service, regardless of cause.  Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1336 (VA's examiner's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the veteran's] disability such that his claim for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence"); Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) ("Congress has designed and fully intends to maintain a beneficial non-adversarial system of veterans benefits.  This is particularly true of service-connected disability compensation where the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty").

To the extent that the grants of service connection for GERD and sleep apnea are based primarily on lay evidence, "[i]f the Board concludes that the lay evidence presented by a veteran is credible and ultimately competent, the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence should not be an absolute bar to the veteran's ability to prove his claim of entitlement to disability benefits based on that competent lay evidence."  Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1337.

At this point, the Board could remand the claims of service connection for GERD and sleep apnea for VA examinations or opinions.  However, a request for opinions could be construed as obtaining additional evidence for the sole purpose of denying the claims, which is impermissible.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c) ("The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination"); Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021) ("Remand is inappropriate where the predominant purpose is not to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision unencumbered by error but to allow VA to obtain more evidence so that it can properly deny the claim").

For the above reasons, the evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's GERD and asthma are related to his active duty service and whether his sleep apnea had its onset during his active duty service.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for GERD, asthma, and sleep apnea is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Entitlement to an increased compensable disability rating for bilateral hearing loss

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Where service connection has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary importance.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the whole recorded history to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition.  The medical as well as industrial history is to be considered, and a full description of the effects of the disability upon ordinary activity is also required.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

VA received the Veteran's claim for an increased compensable disability rating for bilateral hearing loss in July 2022.

Impairment of auditory acuity (hearing?loss)?is?evaluated pursuant to the provisions set forth at 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.  Under that regulation, an examination?for?hearing impairment must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a puretone audiometry test.  Examinations are to be conducted without the use of?hearing?aids.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85(a).  To evaluate the degree of disability from defective?hearing, the?Rating Schedule establishes 11 auditory acuity levels from Level I?for?essentially normal acuity through Level XI?for?profound deafness.  These are assigned based on a combination of the percent of speech discrimination and the puretone threshold average, as contained in a series of tables within the regulations.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85(b).  The "puretone threshold average"?is?the sum of the puretone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz, divided by four.  This average?is?used in all cases to determine the Roman numeral designation?for?hearing?impairment from Table VI or VIa.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85(d). 

Table VIa, "Numeric Designation of?Hearing?Impairment Based Only on Puretone Threshold Average,"?is?used to determine a Roman numeral designation (I through XI) for?hearing?impairment based only on the puretone threshold average.  Table VIa will be used when the examiner certifies that the use of speech discrimination test?is?not appropriate because of language difficulties, inconsistent speech discrimination scores, etc., or when indicated under the provisions of section 4.86.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85(c). 

Table VII, "Percentage Evaluations?for?Hearing?Impairment,"?is?used to determine the percentage evaluation by combining the Roman numeral designations?for hearing impairment of each ear.  The horizontal rows represent the ear having the better?hearing?and the vertical columns the ear having the poorer?hearing.  The percentage evaluation?is?located at the point where the row and column intersect.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85(e). 

The regulatory provisions also provide two additional circumstances under which alternative tables can be employed.  When the puretone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz)?is?55 decibels or more, determine the Roman numeral designation?for?hearing?impairment from either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Each ear will be evaluated separately.  The second?is?where puretone thresholds are 30 decibels or less at frequencies of 1000 Hertz and below and are 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86. 

For?the following reasons, an increased?compensable?disability?rating?for?bilateral hearing loss is?not warranted at any point during the appeal period. 

The Veteran underwent a VA-authorized audiological examination in November 2022.  Puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows: 

	?????????? 	?? 	HERTZ?????????? 	?????????? 	?????????? 

?????????? 	500?????????? 	1000?????????? 	2000?????????? 	3000?????????? 	4000?????????? 

RIGHT?????????? 	25	20	20	30	35

LEFT????????? 	30	35	40	50	50

 

The average puretone thresholds were 26 decibels in the right ear and 44 in the left ear.  In addition, speech discrimination testing using the Maryland CNC word list was 100 percent in both ears.  These examination results reflected Level I hearing loss in both ears.

Under Tables VI and VII in the?Rating?Schedule, the criteria?for?an increased compensable disability rating?for?hearing?loss?are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, DC 6100.  The Board has also considered the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.86, but the results of the audiometric examinations show that the alternative table?is?not more beneficial to the Veteran. 

In Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007), the Court addressed a challenge to VA's audiological testing practices.  Specifically, the Court discussed whether VA's policy of conducting all audiometry testing of?hearing loss?claimants in a sound-controlled room was valid and upheld VA's policy of conducting audiometry testing in a sound-controlled room.  The Court also held that, in addition to dictating objective test results, a VA audiologist must fully describe the functional effects caused by a?hearing?disability in his or her final report.  In this case, the Veteran reported during the November 2022 VA examination that it was difficult for him to understand speech and that he sometimes had to ask for repetition.  Therefore, the report complied with Martinak. 

For?the above reasons, the evidence?is?neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether a?compensable?disability?rating?for bilateral hearing loss is?warranted at any point during the appeal period.  Rather, the evidence at this time weighs persuasively against the criteria required?for?a compensable disability rating, and the benefit of the doubt doctrine?is?therefore not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for back disability and shoulder disability

The Veteran contended in his April 2023 Fully Developed Claim (VA 21-526EZ) and May 2023 Report of General Information (VA Form 27-0820) that his joint pains, to include back and shoulder pain, were related to carrying rucksacks, road marches, and firing weapons in service.

In disability compensation claims, VA must provide a VA medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies; and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability; but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  The threshold under McLendon is low.  

Here, the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has current disabilities or persistent or recurrent symptoms of back and shoulder disabilities that may be associated with service.  As the Veteran was not afforded VA examinations in connection with the claims, remand based on this pre-decisional duty to assist error is warranted to obtain VA examinations.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) (providing that AMA remands may be based on pre-decisional duty to assist errors or any other errors in satisfying a statutory or regulatory duty).  

Accordingly, the matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  Schedule the Veteran for an examination with an appropriate clinician to determine whether it is approximately at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any back disability had its onset in or is related to service, to include carrying rucksacks, road marches, and firing weapons in service.  In this regard, disability does not require a diagnoses, rather, pain causing impairment can constitute disability.

The claims file should be provided to and reviewed by the clinician.  

A complete rationale should accompany any opinion provided.  

2.  Schedule the Veteran for an examination with an appropriate clinician to determine whether it is approximately at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any shoulder disability had its onset in or is related to service, to include carrying rucksacks, road marches, and firing weapons in service.  In this regard, disability does not require a diagnoses, rather, pain causing impairment can constitute disability.

The claims file should be provided to and reviewed by the clinician.
