REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from June 2014 to May 2015. 

This appeal is being adjudicated according to the appellate process set forth under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  See 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 169 (Jan. 18, 2019); 38 C.F.R. § 19.2.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Regional Office of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Evidentiary Standards

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal.  VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  It follows, that when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

The law requires the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran.  Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-29 (2000).  The Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence within the period on appeal and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim. 

Any findings favorable to the Veteran made by the VA Regional Office in notification of a decision are binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the finding.  38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).  "Findings" means "conclusions on questions of fact and application of law to facts made by an adjudicator concerning the issue under review."  Id.  

Service Connection 

VA provides compensation for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  This is referred to as a "service connection."  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1164, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease as incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

Increased Ratings 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  

Diagnostic codes are assigned to individual disabilities.  Diagnostic codes provide rating criteria specific to a particular disability.  If two diagnostic codes are applicable to the same disability, the diagnostic code that allows for the higher disability rating applies.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  

Effective Dates

38 U.S.C. § 5110, which governs the assignment of an effective date for an award of benefits, provides: 

Unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim, or a supplemental claim, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 

38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(1).  The implementing regulation similarly provides that the effective date generally "will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later."  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  "Date of receipt" means the date on which a claim, information, or evidence was received by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).  Exceptions to the general rule exist. 

Analyses

1. The appeal for service connection for GERD is dismissed.  

The Veteran's claim for service connection for GERD was originally denied in a May 19, 2023, rating decision.  On August 20, 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, continuing pursuit of his service connection for GERD claim.  A March 2024 rating decision granted the Veteran's claim for service connection for GERD.  

The Board hs an obligation to ensure that a case or controversy exists.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105.  A case or controversy ceases to exist, and a case become moot, "when the issues presented are no longer 'live' or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome."  Godsey v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 207, 218 (2019).  When the relief sought by an appeal has been accomplished, the appropriate course of action is for the Board to dismiss the matter as moot.  See Long v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 555, 557 (2004).  Here, the Board finds service connection for GERD has been granted.  Thus, there are no additional benefits to award.  Seri v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 441, 447 (2007) (the grant of a claim of service connection constitutes an award of full benefits sought on an appeal of the denial of a service connection claim). 

Accordingly, the appeal for service connection for GERD is dismissed. 

2. The appeal for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is dismissed. 

The Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability was originally denied in a March 2022 rating decision.  In August 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, seeking service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability.  A March 2024 rating decision granted service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (also claimed as major depressive disorder and sleep disturbance).

Accordingly, the appeal for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is dismissed. 

3. The appeal for service connection for sleep disturbance is dismissed. 

The Veteran's claim for service connection for sleep disturbance was originally denied in a May 2023 rating decision.  On August 20, 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Application Claim, continuing pursuit of his service connection for sleep disturbance claim.  A March 2024 rating decision granted the Veteran's claim for sleep disturbance, including it in its grant of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (also claimed as major depressive disorder and sleep disturbance).  

The Board has an obligation to ensure that a case or controversy exists.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105.  A case or controversy ceases to exist, and a case become moot, "when the issues presented are no longer 'live' or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome."  Godsey v.

App. 441, 447 (2007) (the grant of a claim of service connection constitutes an award of full benefits sought on an appeal of the denial of a service connection claim). 

Accordingly, the appeal for service connection for sleep disturbance is dismissed. 

4. The appeal for service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 17 for unspecified depressive disorder is dismissed.

The Veteran's claim for service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 17 for unspecified depressive disorder was originally denied in a March 2021 rating decision.  On August 20, 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, again seeking service connection for treatment purposes only for an acquired psychiatric disability.  A March 2024 rating decision granted the Veteran's claim for service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 17 for unspecified depressive disorder. 

The Board has an obligation to ensure that a case or controversy exists.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105.  A case or controversy ceases to exist, and a case become moot, "when the issues presented are no longer 'live' or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome."  Godsey v.

App. 441, 447 (2007) (the grant of a claim of service connection constitutes an award of full benefits sought on an appeal of the denial of a service connection claim). 

Accordingly, the appeal for service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 17 for an acquired psychiatric disability is dismissed. 

5. The appeal for an effective date prior to August 20, 2023, for the grant of service connection of an acquired psychiatric disability is dismissed. 

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, within a year from the date of issuance of a decision a claimant may elect one of three review options; a request for higher-level review; a Board appeal; or a supplemental claim.  Where the claimant has elected one of those review options, they may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option.  Id. at 3.2500(b). 

The Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability was originally denied in a March 2022 rating decision.  On August 20, 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application again seeking service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability.  A March 2024 rating decision granted the Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability and assigned a 50 percent rating from August 20, 2023.  On April 1, 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review, in response to the March 2024 rating decision.   

On June 22, 2024, while a decision on the Veteran's April 1, 2024, Request for Higher-Level Review, was still pending, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, seeking direct review of the March 2024 rating decision.  The Veteran did not withdraw the previously filed April 1, 2024, Request for Higher-Level Review.  The April 1, 2024, Request for Higher-Level Review was adjudicated by the Regional Office, which issued a Rating Decision responding to the Veteran's appeal in July 2024.  

As the AMA prohibits concurrent election of claims, the June 2024 appeal of the March 2024 rating decision which granted service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability and assigned a rating of 50 percent with an effective date of August 20, 2023, must be dismissed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). 

6. The appeal for an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for an acquired psychiatric disability is dismissed. 

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, within a year from the date of issuance of a decision a claimant may elect one of three review options; a request for higher-level review; a Board appeal; or a supplemental claim.  Where the claimant has elected one of those review options, they may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option.  Id. at 3.2500(b). 

The Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability was originally denied in a March 2022 rating decision.  On August 20, 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application again seeking service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability.  A March 2024 rating decision granted the Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability and assigned a 50 percent rating from August 20, 2023.  On April 1, 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review, in response to the March 2024 rating decision.   

On June 22, 2024, while a decision on the Veteran's April 1, 2024, Request for Higher-Level Review, was still pending, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, seeking direct review of the March 2024 rating decision.  The Veteran did not withdraw the previously filed April 1, 2024, Request for Higher-Level Review.  The April 1, 2024, Request for Higher-Level Review was adjudicated by the Regional Office, which issued a Rating Decision responding to the Veteran's appeal in July 2024.  

As the AMA prohibits concurrent election of claims, the June 2024 appeal of the March 2024 rating decision which granted service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability and assigned a rating of 50 percent with an effective date of August 20, must be dismissed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). 

7. An effective date of February 8, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for GERD is granted. 

The Veteran was granted service connection for GERD in a March 2024 rating decision.  In its March 2024 rating decision, the Regional Office assigned an effective date of June 7, 2023, the date the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim for compensation; however, the Board finds that on careful review, the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim was February 8, 2023.  

On February 8, 2023, the Veteran filed VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, seeking service connection for GERD.  The Regional Office denied the Veteran's claim in a rating decision dated May 19, 2023.  On August 20, 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, continuing pursuit of his claim for service connection for GERD.  The Regional Office granted the Veteran's claim in its March 2024 rating decision.  

Based on the foregoing the Board finds that the proper effective date for the award of service connection for GERD Is February 8, 2023, the date of the Veteran's claim for service connection, which he continuously pursued through the March 2024 rating decision which granted his claim.   Accordingly, an effective date of February 8, 2023, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for GERD is granted. 

8. An initial rating of 30 percent for GERD is granted. 

At the time of the rating decision on appeal, GERD did not have its own Diagnostic Code (DC) and the RO accordingly rated it by analogy to hiatal hernia under DC 7399-7346.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20 ("When an unlisted condition is encountered it will be permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous"); 38 C.F.R. § 4.27 ("When an unlisted disease, injury, or residual condition is encountered, requiring rating by analogy, the [DC] number will be 'built-up' as follows: The first 2 digits will be selected from that part of the schedule most closely identifying the part, or system, of the body involved; the last 2 digits will be '99' for all unlisted conditions"); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.27 ("if the rating is determined on the basis of residual conditions, the number appropriate to the residual condition will be added, preceded by a hyphen"). 

Diagnostic Code 7346 provides:

	Rating (%)

Hernia hiatal:	

Symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health	60

Persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health	30

With two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity	10

Diagnostic Code 7346 does not define the terms "considerable impairment of health" and "severe impairment in health." Absent an express definition, it is presumed that VA regulations employ words using their ordinary dictionary meanings at the time the regulations were promulgated. See Nielson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d 802, 805-06 (Fed. Cir. 2010). 

An "impairment" from a disease or injury is "any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological or anatomical structure or function." World Health Organization, International classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps: A manual of classification relating to the consequences of disease, May 1976, available at https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/41003 (last visited March 31, 2025). 

The terms "considerable" and "severe" are adjectives that advise of the degree of impairment required to warrant a 30 and 60 percent disability rating, respectively. "Considerable" means "large in extent or degree." Considerable, Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/considerable, Definition 2 (last visited March 31, 2025). "Severe" means "very painful or harmful" and "of a great degree." Severe, Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/severe, Definitions 6.b. and 8 (last visited March 31, 2025).

In addition, where the rating criteria are written in the conjunctive, to establish entitlement to a particular rating, a claimant must demonstrate each of the criteria listed in the rating.  Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 366 (2007).

Using the above definitions as guidance, the Board must arrive at an equitable and just decision based on an evaluation of all relevant evidence. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

During the pendency of the appeal, VA published amendments to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, the Schedule of Ratings for the Digestive System.  These revisions are effective My 19, 2024.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 19,735 (Mar. 20, 2024).  Under the amended criteria, a new diagnostic code (DC 7206) was added for GERD, which provides the same criteria as DC 7203 for stricture of the esophagus. 

Diagnostic Code 7206 provides: 

7206 Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease		Rating (%)

Documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction of esophageal stricture(s) or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube)	80

Documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year; (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement	50

Documented history of recurrent esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year	30

Documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic	10

Documented history without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications

Note (1): Findings must be documented by barium swallow, computerized tomography, or esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

Note (2): Non-gastrointestinal complications of procedures should be rated under the appropriate system. 

Note (3): This diagnostic code applies, but is not limited to, esophagitis, mechanical or chemical; Mallory Weiss syndrome (bleeding at junction of esophagus and stomach due to tears) due to caustic ingestion of alkali or acid; drug-induced or infectious esophagitis due to peptic stricture; and any esophageal condition that requires treatment with sclerotherapy.  

Note (4): Recurrent esophageal stricture is defined as the inability to maintain target esophageal diameter beyond 4 weeks after the target diameter has been achieved.  

Note (5): Refractory esophageal stricture is defined as the inability to achieve target esophageal diameter despite receiving no fewer than 5 dilatation sessions performed at 2-week intervals	0

If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change.  38 U.S.C. § 5110.  Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claim under the old criteria prior to May 19, 2024, and both the old and revised rating criteria from May 19, 2024.  The criteria that is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied. 

Here, the Veteran asserts entitlement to an initial disability rating of 30 percent from February 7, 2023.  He was granted service connection for GERD in a March 2024 rating decision, which assigned a 10 percent rating from the date of claim.  

VA treatment records throughout the appeal period are silent for evidence regarding the severity of the Veteran's GERD.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination regarding the severity of his GERD in March 2023.  The VA examiner documented an in-person examination in combination with review of the Veteran's records.  The VA examiner documented the Veteran's report that his GERD began in service with heartburn and vomiting that required him to sleep sitting up in a chair if he ate late at night.  The Veteran reported that he was diagnosed with GERD in 2021.  The Veteran reported current symptoms of burning in chest and throat and reflux that caused coughing.  The VA examiner documented symptoms of reflux.  The Veteran did not have esophageal stricture, spasm of esophagus (cardiospasm or achalasia), or an acquired diverticulum of the esophagus. The Veteran did not have a benign or malignant neoplasm or metastases.  The VA examiner documented that the Veteran's GERD impacted his ability to work in that occupational tasks that do not allow frequent bathroom breaks due to reflux or potential regurgitation should be avoided.  

On subsequent VA examination in March 2024, the VA examiner documented an in-person examination in combination with review of the Veteran's records.  The Veteran reported current symptoms of heartburn, chest pain, stomach burning, regurgitation, and burping.  The VA examiner documented symptoms persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, reflux, and regurgitation.  Additionally, the VA examiner documented sleep disturbance caused by GERD 4 or more times per year, with an average duration of 10 days or more, episodes of nausea 4 or more times per year with an average duration of 10 days or more, and episodes of vomiting 4 or more time per year with an average duration of 10 days or more.  There Veteran did not have esophageal stricture, spasm of the esophagus (cardiospasm or achalasia), or an acquired diverticulum of the esophagus.  The VA examiner documented that the Veteran's GERD impacted his ability to work in that he had lost greater than 5 weeks of work time in the last 12 months due to difficulty working with constant abdominal pain, chest pain, burping, nausea, abdominal burning, vomiting and diarrhea.  

On careful review, the Board finds that the Veteran's GERD is manifested by symptoms which more closely approximate the criteria for a 30 percent disability from the date of service connection, applying the former version of DC 7346 that was in effect prior to May 19, 2024.  The evidence of record consistently show that he experiences symptoms such as dysphagia, reflux, and regurgitation, which are listed as criteria for a 30 percent rating under DC 7346.  Accordingly, the Veteran's symptoms of GERD more nearly approximate those required for an increased 30 percent disability under 7346.  

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's GERD symptoms include material weight loss, hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  

Based on the foregoing evidence, an initial rating of 30 percent but no higher for GERD is granted.
