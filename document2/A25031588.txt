REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1976 to November 1977.

The case is on appeal from a December 2022 notification of the Debt Management Center (DMC).

In the February 2025 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 DMC notification on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the notification on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Regional Office (RO) in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that, in February 2025, the Board granted an extension of the period for filing the February 2025 NOD with respect to the validity of the debt based on a finding of good cause.  In addition, and although the February 2025 letter in that respect references a December 9, 2022 decision of the Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC), the DMC issued the December 9, 2022 notification on appeal.  As such, the scope of the appeal is limited to whether the overpayment was validly created.

The Board notes that in a statement accompanying the February 2025 NOD, the Veteran's attorney waived a docket switch per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).

Additionally, the Board notes that the Veteran has an appeal pending in a separate appeal stream with respect to a higher rate and effective earlier date for special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for aid and attendance.  Those issues will be addressed in a separate decision.

Validity of an overpayment of VA compensation benefits in the amount of $87,130.74.

The overpayment of VA compensation benefits in the amount of $87,130.74 was created as a result of the RO's grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), effective in August 1984.  See December 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran's attorney asserts that the Veteran was paid correctly.

In a June 2024 letter, the Veteran's attorney requested an explanation as to how the debt was created and requested an audit.  See January 2025 Debt Disagreement/Dispute. 

Thereafter, January 2025 Email Correspondence notes that the Veteran disputed an overpayment of $59,000 and reflects a retroactive payment of $208,884.27 on December 20, 2022.

In a statement accompanying the February 2025 NOD, the Veteran's attorney noted that, of the total award of $411,957.00 for the period August 1, 1984 through February 1, 2002, the Veteran was paid $204,428.00 for that same period, and thus, the payment of $207.529.00 was the correct amount ($411,957.00 - $204,428.00).  Additionally, the attorney stated that the payment of $208,884.27 noted above exceeds $207.529.00.

Under the AMA, the Board may remand for correction of either a pre-decisional duty to assist error or any other error by the RO in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  A remand is necessary to provide the Veteran an audit to ensure that the amount of overpayment was validly created.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a); 38 C.F.R. § 1.911(c) (stating that a claimant has the right to dispute the existence and amount of a debt, which is a right that may be exercised separately from a request for waiver or at the same time).  That correction raises a reasonable possibility of aiding the challenge to the validity of the overpayment.  Accordingly, remand under the AMA for these and similar circumstances remains appropriate.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the Veteran a paid and due audit of compensation benefits for the period beginning August 1, 1984.

2. After completion of the above, adjudicate the matter of the validity of the debt in the amount of $87,130.74, clearly explaining the amount owed and the amount paid, to include addressing the asserted discrepancies, including between the payment to the Veteran of $207.529.00 and a payment of $208,884.27 noted in January 2025 Email Correspondence and the assertion of sole administrative error.
