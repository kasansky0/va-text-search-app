ORDER

The reduction of the 100 percent rating for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with asthma to a 60 percent rating, effective August 1, 2022, was not proper; therefore, the 100 percent rating is restored.

The reduction of the 60 percent rating for OSA with asthma to a 50 percent rating, effective August 9, 2022, was not proper; therefore, the 100 percent rating is restored.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran did not sustain material improvement in his OSA with asthma during the period on appeal.

2. The Veteran is in receipt of the maximum disability rating for OSA with asthma during the period on appeal.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The reduction in the rating assigned for asthma with OSA from 100 percent to 60 percent, effective August 1, 2022, was not proper; as such, restoration of the 100 percent rating is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.344, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6847.

2. The reduction in the rating assigned for asthma with OSA from 60 percent to 50 percent, effective August 9, 2022, was not proper; as such, restoration of the 100 percent rating is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.344, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6847.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1992 to June 1998.  

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

These matters have a complicated procedural history. 

Based on a special review of the Veteran's claim by way of an April 2021 VA examination, in a May 2022 rating decision, the RO reduced the Veteran's rating for asthma with OSA from 100 percent to 60 percent, effective August 1, 2022.  

In July 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ claim for an increased rating for his OSA with asthma disability. 

The Board notes that under the modernized review system, a claim for an increased rating on a VA Form 21-526EZ is an "initial claim" that requests a higher rating based on a change or worsening of the condition and should not be interpreted as requesting review of a rating assigned in a prior decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(1) (defining a claim for increased rating as an "initial claim" rather than a supplemental claim); see 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(b). Accordingly, in the modernized review system, when a claimant files an increased rating claim on a VA Form 21-526EZ, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) should consider the appropriate rating for the service-connected disability for the period from receipt of the claim through the issuance of the decision on the claim (to include the 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o) one-year lookback period, when appropriate). Moreover, a VA Form 21-526 EZ does not maintain continuous pursuit of the prior claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). Instead, if a claimant would like to continuously pursue a rating assigned in a prior decision, within a year of issuance of that decision, they should file a request for higher-level review (HLR) (on a VA Form 21-0996), supplemental claim (on a VA Form 21-0995), or Board appeal (on a VA form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a).

Here, given that the submission containing the VA Form 21-526EZ was received within one year of the May 2022 rating decision, and the AOJ erroneously accepted this form, the Board will construe the Veteran's submission to be a claim seeking review of the May 2022 rating decision and not an "initial claim" that requests a higher rating based on a change or worsening of the condition.

As noted above, although generally a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, is interpreted as a new increased rating claim, given this unique procedural posture, the Board will interpret the July 2022 claim submitted within one year of the May 2022 rating decision as a supplemental claim.  

In response to the July 2022 claim, in an October 2022 rating decision, the RO again reduced the Veteran's OSA with asthma rating from 60 percent to 50 percent, effective August 9, 2022. 

In an April 2023 rating decision, the RO continued the Veteran's 50 percent rating for OSA with asthma. This Veteran was informed of this decision in a May 2023 notification letter.  

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2022, October 2022, and April 2023 decisions.  In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2022 and October 2022 decisions, and the May 2023 notification of the April 2023 decision letter.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 notification of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision (as this decision deals with the same matter as the May 2022 and October 2022 decisions, the Board is choosing the longest appeal period because it is most favorable to the Veteran), which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Rating reductions 

Where action by the rating agency would result in the reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments, 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) requires that a rating initially proposing the reduction or discontinuance be prepared setting out all material facts and reasons for the proposed action. The regulation requires that the beneficiary of the compensation payments be notified at his latest address of record of the contemplated action, furnished detailed reasons, and be given 60 days from the date of the notice for the presentation of additional evidence to show that the compensation payments should be continued at their present level. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). Furthermore, 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(i) requires that the Veteran be informed that he may request a pre-determination hearing provided that the request is received by VA within 30 days from the date of the notice of the proposed rating reduction. The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 direct that unless otherwise provided by the subsection (i), final rating action will be taken, and the award will be reduced or discontinued effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).

Congress has provided that a veteran's disability will not be reduced unless an improvement in the disability is shown to have occurred. 38 U.S.C. § 1155. A rating reduction is warranted only where the evidence contains thorough medical examinations demonstrating an actual improvement in disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.13. The standard requires that there be a finding by the rating agency that material improvement in the disability has taken place.  Id.  In any rating reduction case, not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred, but also that the improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work, supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Stern v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 51 (2021).

Moreover, a rating that has been in effect for 5 years or more, such as in the case at hand, may not be reduced on the basis of only one examination in cases where the disability is the result of a disease subject to periodic or episodic improvement, such as asthma. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a). The 5-year period is calculated from the effective date of the rating to the effective date of the reduction. Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 419 (1993).

A rating becomes entitled to heightened protections under § 3.344(c) only when it has existed at the exact same percentage for at least 5 years. Simon v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 403, 410 (2018). The applicability of § 3.344 is premised on how long a disability rating per VA's rating schedule has been in place, as opposed to how long some baseline symptomatology has existed. Id. at 411. Section 3.344(a) applies when a rating exists for 5 years without changing its degree or position on the rating schedule. Id. These requirements do not apply to ratings that have not continued for long periods at the same level (five years or more) or to disabilities which have not become stabilized and are likely to improve. Rather, in such cases, reexaminations disclosing improvement, physical or mental, in these disabilities will warrant a rating reduction. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c).

Reports of examination must be interpreted in the light of the whole evidentiary history and reconciled with the various reports into a consistent picture, so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2.

The reduction of the 100 percent rating for OSA with asthma to a 60 percent rating, effective August 1, 2022

The reduction of the 60 percent rating for OSA with asthma to a 50 percent rating, effective August 9, 2022

The Board finds that both the reduction of the rating for OSA with asthma to a 60 percent rating, effective August 1, 2022, and the reduction of the 60 percent rating for OSA with asthma to a 50 percent rating, effective August 9, 2022, were not proper.  

The Board notes that the Veteran's OSA with asthma was rated at 100 percent disabling from December 28, 2016, to July 31, 2022, and as this is a period of over 5 years, this rating is entitled to heightened protections under § 3.344(c).  

While the Veteran did initially request a hearing in a July 2021 statement in response to the June 2021 notification of proposal to reduce his OSA with asthma disability rating, in a March 2022 statement, he indicated that he was willing to attend a new VA examination instead of a pre-determination hearing.  As the Veteran was afforded a new VA examination in March 2022, the Board finds that his request for a pre-determination hearing was withdrawn.  

The Veteran was granted a 100 percent rating for his OSA with asthma in a March 2018 rating decision based on the medical evidence of record at that time, which included February 2018 VA examinations for OSA and asthma.  A February 2018 VA asthma examination report indicated that the Veteran's symptoms were worsening, as last August he was in the ER three times.  His symptoms were described as variable exacerbations and flares, and the examiner noted that the Veteran uses a Combivent rescue inhaler approximately three times a day, activity and weather dependent.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's asthma requires intermittent courses or bursts of systemic corticosteroids, with 4 or more courses in the past 12 years, and requires daily use of systemic high dose corticosteroids, daily inhalational bronchodilator therapy and inhalational anti-inflammatory medication, and daily oral bronchodilators.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran has had 4 or more asthma attacks with episodes of respiratory failure in the past 12 months, weekly exacerbations, and doctor's visits less frequently than monthly.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's asthma disability impacts his ability to work, as a cold room, walking fast, or temperature changes triggers an asthma attack, and the Veteran has decreased mental clarity and focus with attacks.  

A February 2018 OSA VA examination report indicated that the Veteran's symptoms included daytime sleepiness, snoring, teeth grinding, and drowning dreams.  It indicated that the Veteran requires use of a CPAP machine and has persistent daytime hypersomnolence, loud snoring, and intermittent stops in his breathing at night. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's OSA impacts his ability to work because it limits his ability to think clearly, have good judgement, focus, and causes low energy and fatigue, and indicated that he can fall asleep while driving.  

An April 2021 VA examination report indicated that the Veteran stated that he uses two air purifiers in the house and has easy fatigability, and that his asthma is stable. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's asthma required the use of inhalational bronchodilator therapy on a daily basis and inhalational anti-inflammatory medication on a daily basis.  The examiner stated that the Veteran's asthma impacted his ability to work, because due to exertional shortness of breath and fatigue, the Veteran may not be able to fully exert himself to the full capacity or for a long period of time.  The examiner indicated that symptoms noted in this examination were for the Veteran's asthma, and symptoms noted on the April 2021 sleep apnea VA examination report were for OSA.  

An April 2021 sleep apnea examination report indicated that the Veteran noted some improvement in sleep quality but indicated that he has intermittent compliance with CPAP usage because of his nasal congestion.  The examiner indicate that the Veteran requires the usage of a CPAP.  The examiner indicated that there was no change in the Veteran's OSA.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's OSA did not impact his ability to work. 

A March 2022 VA respiratory conditions examination report indicated that the Veteran stated that over time, his asthma symptoms worsened. The Veteran stated that he cannot go outside for a long period of time and needs air filters and purifiers. The Veteran indicated that he has had multiple rounds of steroids due to asthma exacerbations requiring PCP and emergency care visits.  The examiner stated that the Veteran requires intermittent courses of bursts of systemic corticosteroids and had 4 or more in the past 12 months.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran requires intermittent inhalational bronchodilator therapy and daily inhalational antiinflammatory therapy.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran has had 2-3 episodes of asthma exacerbations where he has to go to the doctor in the past year.  The examiner stated that the Veteran's asthma impacts his ability to work.  He stated that due to exertional shortness of breath, the Veteran is unable to fully exert himself to full physical capacity for a prolonged period of time.  

A March 2022 VA OSA examination report indicated that the Veteran uses a CPAP and has persistent daytime hypersomnolence.  The examiner indicated that there was no change in the Veteran's OSA.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's OSA did not impact his ability to work.

August 2, 2022, VA treatment records indicate that the Veteran had an asthma exacerbation.  They indicated that he came to the emergency department for his asthma.   They noted that he has had several weeks of persistent shortness of breath, with waxing and waning asthma exacerbations.  The Veteran was provided a prednisone taper. 

August 30th, 2022, VA treatment records indicated that the Veteran presented at the ER with an asthma flare.  He stated that in the last few days he has felt like he has more difficulty breathing.  He was provided a steroid burst.  

September 9th, 2022, VA treatment records indicated that the Veteran presented at the emergency department indicating that he needs additional steroids for his asthma.  He was provided with them.  

October 2022 VA treatment records indicate that the Veteran reported frequent exacerbations of his asthma.  

November 2022 VA treatment records indicates that the Veteran reported an asthma attack with intercourse, which was at least ten times as bad as normal. 

After careful review, the Board finds that while the evidence does indicate that the Veteran's OSA with asthma disability has had some improvement, it does not indicate that the Veteran's OSA with asthma sustained material improvement under the ordinary conditions of daily life. Here, the VA treatment records show that the Veteran had to go to the emergency department for breathing difficulties three times between August and September 2022 and was put on additional steroid bursts, and in October 2022 he reported frequent asthma exacerbations.  Both the April 2021 and March 2022 VA examination reports for asthma indicated that the Veteran's asthma impacted his ability to work and noted that the Veteran experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath, easy fatigability, and asthma exacerbations, and need air filters in his house.

In sum, after reviewing the evidence of record, the Board does not find that there was a material improvement in the Veteran's OSA with asthma under the ordinary conditions of daily life.  Therefore, the reduction to 60 percent, effective August 1, 2022, was improper in the May 2022 rating decision, and the reduction to 50 percent, effective August 9, 2022, was improper as well, and a restoration of the 100 percent rating for OSA with asthma, effective August 1, 2022, is warranted.

As the Veteran has been granted a 100 percent maximum schedular evaluation from December 28, 2016, the Veteran has been awarded the maximum benefits allowed by law during the period on appeal. See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993) (a claimant is presumed to be seeking the maximum rating allowed by law).
