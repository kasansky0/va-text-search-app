ORDER

The July 19, 2024, request for an extension of time to file an appeal from a rating decision issued on September 4, 2019, that denied service connection for anxiety/depression, bilateral hearing loss, and bilateral tinnitus is denied, and the attempted appeal is therefore dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not timely file a Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182) with respect to the rating decision issued on September 4, 2019, that denied service connection for anxiety/depression, bilateral hearing loss, and bilateral tinnitus, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The July 19, 2024, Board Appeal request is not timely with respect to the rating decision issued on September 4, 2019, that denied service connection for anxiety/depression, bilateral hearing loss, and bilateral tinnitus, and the criteria for an extension of time to file a Board Appeal request have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 3.2500(b), 20.202, 20.203. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1957 to July 1958. The Veteran filed a July 19, 2024 Board Appeal request seeking to appeal a September 4, 2019 rating decision and selecting the Hearing docket.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran requested a hearing. Hearings are provided to appellants who properly request one in association with appellate review of a VA decision.?38?U.S.C. §?7105; 38?C.F.R. §?20.302. In this case, the Board has not accepted appellate review and no hearing will be provided.  

On the same July 19, 2024, Board Appeal request, the Veteran listed issues denied in legacy system rating decisions issued on May 10, 2018 (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and on November 17, 2017 (bilateral pes planus, cervical spine, lumbar spine, right and left ankle, right and left hip, right and left knee). The modernized Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system applies to claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019 or when the claimant elects review of a legacy claim through the Rapid appeals modernization program (RAMP), or by opting-in to the modernized systems after the issuance of an SOC or SSOC. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2(a), 3.2400. As the 2018 and 2017 rating decisions were issued in the legacy system, they are not eligible to be appealed in the AMA system. 

Timeliness of an Appeal

Under the AMA, an appeal consists of a properly completed NOD on the form prescribed by the Secretary submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(b)(1)(A); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.2500(a)(1), 20.202, 20.203. A question as to the timeliness or adequacy of an NOD shall be decided by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C).

An extension of the period for filing an NOD may be granted for good cause. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Id. When an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38?C.F.R. §?3.109(b). Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c).

Examples of good cause may include serious illness or injury of the appellant or representative, or the appellant's inability to access mail services due to homelessness, or overseas deployment. Examples that would not constitute good cause include change in representation, change in preference of a review option at the AOJ or among the Board review options, difficulty in obtaining evidence, or discovery of new evidence during a period in which the duty to assist does not apply. 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 155 (Jan. 18, 2019).

Timeliness of July 19, 2024 NOD with respect to the September 4, 2019 rating decision.

On July 19, 2024, the Veteran filed a Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the rating decision issued on September 4, 2019 that denied service connection for anxiety/depression, bilateral hearing loss, and bilateral tinnitus. The Veteran asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal because of his "Deterioration of health including sight and overwhelming fatigue necessary to use computer during course of last two years." The Veteran also asserted he had a new medical issue identified on July 15, 2024, that necessitated review of his claim.

For the reasons explained below, the Board concludes that the attempted appeal was not timely and good cause has not been presented to warrant an extension of time to file an appeal from the September 4, 2019 rating decision.

As noted above, the rating decision issued on September 4, 2019 denied service connection for anxiety/depression, bilateral hearing loss, and bilateral tinnitus. The Veteran was notified of the decision in a letter that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letter was sent to the Veteran's address of record and was not returned as undeliverable.

The Veteran's July 19, 2024 Board Appeal request was not timely filed because it was received more than one year after the rating decision issued on September 4, 2019.

The Board finds the Veteran's assertions do not constitute good cause. The Veteran's assertion that deterioration of health including his sight and overwhelming fatigue over the two years prior to his July 19, 2024, Board Appeal request does not explain why he was unable to file an appeal within one year of the rating decision issued on September 4, 2019. Unfortunately, even if the deterioration of health over the past two years constituted serious illness or injury, an appeal submitted two years ago would still have been untimely. Similarly, the Veteran's assertion that a new medical issue was identified on July 15, 2024, that necessitated review of his claim is also not good cause. Further, the record shows that the Veteran was able to submit a statement and supplemental claim for the claims of anxiety/depression, bilateral hearing loss, and bilateral tinnitus in December 2019. These claims were addressed in a February 2020 rating decision. The Veteran also submitted an intent to file on May 19, 2022, a claim for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) on February 7, 2023, and contacted VA several times in March 2023 and April 2023 regarding examinations scheduled for other claims. Given the above, the Veteran's assertions do not explain why the Veteran could not submit a timely Board Appeal request within one year following the rating decision issued on September 4, 2019, or could not file his Board Appeal request earlier than it was.

Accordingly, the July 19, 2024 Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to the rating decision issued on September 4, 2019, that denied for anxiety/depression, bilateral hearing loss, and bilateral tinnitus, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. The extension request is denied and the attempted appeal is dismissed.
