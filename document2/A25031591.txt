FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In an August 2022 rating decision, the Regional Office (RO) denied a claim for service connection for degenerative arthritis of the neck, a left shoulder condition, left thumb condition, and left index finger condition.  The Veteran was notified of the decision the following month.  The Veteran was notified of the rating decision in August 2022 and provided with notice of his appellate rights.  The Veteran did not file a VA Form 10182.  

2. New evidence that is relevant to the claim for service connection for a cervical spine condition has been received since the August 2022 rating decision.

3. New evidence that is relevant to the claim for service connection for a left shoulder disability has been received since the August 2022 rating decision. 

4. New evidence that is relevant to the claim for service connection for a left thumb disability has been received since the August 2022 rating decision.  

5. New evidence that is relevant to the claim for service connection for a left index finger disability has been received since the August 2022 rating decision.  

6. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine is related to service.  

7. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether arthritis of the left shoulder is proximately due to degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine.  

8. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether left thumb numbness is proximately due to the Veteran's cervical spine arthritis.  

9. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether left index finger numbness is proximately due to the Veteran's cervical spine arthritis.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1990 to January 1991 and from September 1992 to November 1997.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Service connection 

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.  That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  As arthritis is considered to be a chronic disease for VA compensation purposes, if chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In addition, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, including arthritis, are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Service connection is also warranted for disability that is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Secondary service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) is warranted where a non service-connected disability would have been less severe but for a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability.  Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023) ("Put together, § 1110 plainly requires compensation when a service-connected disease or injury is a but-for cause of a present-day disability.  This broad language applies to the natural progression of a condition not caused by a service-connected injury or disease, but that nonetheless would have been less severe were it not for the service-connected disability.  Stated another way, § 1110 provides for compensation for a worsening of functionality-whether through an inability to treat or a more direct, etiological cause.  Nothing in the statute limits § 1110 to onset or etiological causes of a worsening in functionality."

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is received with respect to a supplemental claim.  New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.  Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim.  Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.  The new and relevant standard will not impose a higher evidentiary threshold than the previous new and material evidence standard under § 3.156(a).  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The evidentiary record for a supplemental claim includes all evidence received by VA before VA issues notice of a decision on the supplemental claim.  For VA to readjudicate the claim, the evidentiary record must include new and relevant evidence that was not of record as of the date of notice of the prior decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(b).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

New and relevant evidence for service connection for cervical spine disability, left shoulder disability, left thumb contusion, and left index finger contusion 

An August 2022 rating decision denied service connection for degenerative arthritis of the neck, a left shoulder condition, left thumb condition, and left index finger condition.  

The rating decision found that there was no nexus between his current cervical spine disability and service. The rating decision found that a left shoulder condition was not shown in service or within one year of discharge.  The rating decision found that the Veteran did not have a left thumb disability in service and did not have a current left thumb disability.

The rating decision found that the Veteran did not have a left index finger disability in service and did not have a current left index finger disability.

The Veteran was notified of the rating decision in August 2022 and provided with notice of his appellate rights. 

In April 2023, he submitted a request for Higher Level Review.  In May 2023, he submitted a medical opinion from a private chiropractor.  He submitted a Supplemental Claim in October 2023.  

The Board finds that new and relevant evidence has been received. The evidence includes a medical nexus opinion that was not of record at the time of the prior final denial.  The evidence is new and relevant. 

Therefore, readjudication of the claim for service connection for cervical spine, left shoulder, left thumb, and left index finger disabilities is warranted.

Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability 

The Veteran contends that a current cervical spine disability is due to injuries from a motor vehicle accident during service.  He further asserts that he sustained injuries in service from being struck on the head by concrete buoy sinkers and a vertical watertight hatch.  See May 2023 physician statement.  

Service treatment records reflect that the Veteran reported injuries to his head and neck.  An August 1997 entry reflects that he reported hitting his head on a hatch.  He denied a neck problem.  A January 1996 entry reflects that he presented to sick call with sore hands, a stiff neck, and pain in his left knee.  Examination showed tenderness over the right trapezius.  

Post-service treatment records reflect a current diagnosis of degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine.  See June 2022 VA examination.  

The Veteran had a VA examination in June 2022.  The VA examiner opined that degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine and bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy are less likely than not incurred in or caused by the neck condition during service.  The examiner explained that STR's show that the Veteran complained of neck pain during his MVA in 1996, but there was no neck condition diagnosed, only acute trapezius strain.  He had a normal cervical spine exam at that time.  The examiner noted that the Veteran also had normal cervical spine on the separation exam in 1997 and denied having any neck problems.  Also, there were no complaints of neck problems until 2021, well after service.  Degenerative arthritis is due to normal age-related changes.  Degenerative arthritis is causing spinal nerve compression resulting in bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy.

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a medical opinion from a private chiropractor. The opinion noted that the Veteran had been treated in his office for chronic neck pain.  The physician noted occasional episodes of pain that traveled into the left shoulder and left hand, causing numbness in the left hand, and sometimes causing numbness in the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger.  He noted that the Veteran had informed him of injuries during military service, including a motorcycle accident, being struck on the head by concrete buoy sinkers, and being struck on the head by a vertical watertight hatch (of significant weight).  He opined that these incidents, along with a lack of timely treatment, contributed to the Veteran's chronic ongoing spine condition.  

The private medical opinion was based on accurate facts and provided a detailed rationale that considered lay and medical evidence.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  The Board notes that the VA examiner relied on an absence of complaints in service and for several years post service.  An absence of complaints in service is an inadequate basis for a negative opinion.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39-40 (2007).  The Board finds the private chiropractor's opinion probative as to a medical nexus to service.  

The Board finds that the requirements of service connection are met.  The record reflects injuries of the cervical spine and neck pain during service.  The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether his diagnosed cervical spine arthritis is related to service events.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder arthritis

Entitlement to service connection for left thumb and left index finger 

The Veteran contends that left shoulder arthritis is related to injuries in service, including a motorcycle accident and a car accident in service and being hit by concrete sinker blocks.  

A July 1994 entry in the service treatment record noted a complaint of an abrasion of the left forearm from a motor vehicle accident.  Service treatment records reflect that the Veteran reported that he was in a motor vehicle accident in January 1996.  The Veteran did not report left shoulder symptoms at that time.  However, he reported sore hands and a stiff neck.  

The Veteran had a VA examination of his left hand and left shoulder in June 2022.  The examination noted that the Veteran reported a history of a left shoulder injury due to a motor vehicle accident and being hit by concrete blocks.  The VA examiner opined that a left shoulder disability is less likely than not related to service.  The VA examiner opined that STR's are silent for a diagnosis or treatment of a left shoulder condition during active duty or within one year of discharge.  The examiner explained that this is supported by the fact that the Veteran had a normal shoulder exam on separation in 1997 and denied having any shoulder problems.  The VA examiner noted a history of an old traumatic separation of the left acromioclavicular joint.  

The June 2022 VA examination reflects that the Veteran reported a left hand condition from a MVA during service.  He reported that his symptoms included numbness and tingling of the left thumb and left index finger.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran did not have a condition associated with his left hand. 

In Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F. 3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), 886 F.3d at 1364-65, the Federal Circuit held that pain alone could constitute disability under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 if it causes impairment.  The Veteran is competent to report numbness of his left hand.  The Veteran is competent to report experiencing numbness in his fingers.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307-308 (2007) (holding that lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  The Board finds that the Veteran's left hand numbness causes impairment in earning capacity.  Therefore, the requirement of a current disability of the left hand, including the thumb and index finger, is met. 

In the May 2023 opinion discussed above, the private chiropractor opinion noted occasional episodes of pain that travel into the left shoulder and left hand, causing numbness in the left hand and sometimes causing numbness in the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger.  He noted that the Veteran had informed him of injuries during military service, including a motorcycle accident, being struck on the head by concrete buoy sinkers, and being struck on the head by a vertical watertight hatch (of significant weight).  He opined that these incidents, along with a lack of timely treatment, contributed to his chronic ongoing spine condition.  As the May 2023 private medical opinion indicates a causal relationship between the Veteran's cervical spine and left shoulder and left hand disabilities, indicating that his pain traveling from his spine to his left upper extremity.  The opinion provides a nexus on a proximate cause basis secondary to the Veteran's cervical spine disability.  Accordingly, service connection for left shoulder arthritis, and left upper extremity pain and numbness, is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
