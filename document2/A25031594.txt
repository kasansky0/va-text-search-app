ORDER

The January 27, 2025 request for an extension of time to file an appeal from a rating decision issued on August 18, 2023 that denied service connection for sleep apnea is denied, and the attempted appeal is therefore dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not timely file a Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182) with respect to the rating decision issued on August 18, 2023 that denied service connection for sleep apnea, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The January 27, 2025 Board Appeal request is not timely with respect to the rating decision issued on August 18, 2023 that denied service connection for sleep apnea, and the criteria for an extension of time to file a Board Appeal request have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 3.2500(b), 20.202, 20.203. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1969 to July 1971. The Veteran filed a January 27, 2025 Board Appeal request seeking to appeal an August 18, 2023 rating decision and selecting the Evidence Submission docket.  

Timeliness of an Appeal

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an appeal consists of a properly completed NOD on the form prescribed by the Secretary submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(b)(1)(A); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.2500(a)(1), 20.202, 20.203. A question as to the timeliness or adequacy of an NOD shall be decided by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C). 

An extension of the period for filing an NOD may be granted for good cause. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Id. When an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38?C.F.R. §?3.109(b). Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). 

Examples of good cause may include serious illness or injury of the appellant or representative, or the appellant's inability to access mail services due to homelessness, or overseas deployment. Examples that would not constitute good cause include change in representation, change in preference of a review option at the AOJ or among the Board review options, difficulty in obtaining evidence, or discovery of new evidence during a period in which the duty to assist does not apply. 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 155 (Jan. 18, 2019).

Timeliness of the January 27, 2025 Board Appeal request with respect to the rating decision issued on August 18, 2023.

On January 27, 2025, the Veteran filed a Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the rating decision issued on August 18, 2023 that denied service connection for sleep apnea. The Veteran asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal because the August 18, 2023 rating decision denying him disability compensation was vague and ambiguous as to which of his claims was being denied and for what reasons. The Veteran explained he was originally granted service connection for tinnitus on January 24, 2022, and that he filed a claim for sleep apnea on March 9, 2023. The Veteran stated he then filed a supplemental claim on May 21, 2023, which was denied in the August 2023 rating decision, but he asserts that he was never notified about the status of his earlier claim. The Veteran stated he called VA to inquire about that claim and was told that it had somehow disappeared and that he needed to file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The Veteran stated that he filed a FOIA request on September 11, 2024, the records requested were mailed to him on December 10, 2024, and he is now requesting an extension of time to request review of that decision. See January 2025 Correspondence, Veteran Statement.

For the reasons explained below, the Board concludes that the attempted appeal was not timely and good cause has not been presented to warrant an extension of time to file an appeal from the rating decision issued on August 18, 2023. 

As noted above, the rating decision issued on August 18, 2023 denied service connection for sleep apnea. The Veteran and the Veteran's representative were notified of the decision in a letter that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letter was sent to the Veteran's address of record and was not returned as undeliverable.

The Veteran's January 27, 2025 NOD was not timely filed because it was received more than one year after the rating decision issued on August 18, 2023, that denied service connection for sleep apnea. 

The Board finds the Veteran's above-listed assertions do not constitute good cause warranting an extension of time to file his appeal. The Veteran stated he was never informed of the status of his March 9, 2023 claim, however, this statement is not factually correct. VA sent the Veteran a letter on May 9, 2023, informing him that it had received mail indicating that he would like the VA to review a claim for sleep apnea that was previously denied. See May 2023 Request for Application AMA Review Letter. The Board notes that the Veteran was initially denied service connection for sleep apnea in a February 23, 2023 rating decision. The Veteran's March 9, 2023 claim was filed on a VA Form 21-526EZ, and the May 9, 2023 VA letter informed the Veteran that because the claim was previously denied, he needed to file on the proper form. The letter informed the Veteran which form must be used for each available review option. On May 21, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application asserting entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, listing the February 2023 rating decision as the date of the VA decision being appealed. 

The Veteran's filing of a Supplemental Claim on the correct VA form, as instructed in VA's May 9, 2023 letter, reflects an understanding that the Veteran's March 9, 2023 claim that was incorrectly filed on a VA Form 21-526EZ was the same as the claim filed on May 21, 2023, using the correct VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application. In other words, the Veteran was informed of the status of his March 9, 2023 claim and, after he was informed of the proper form to use, he submitted his Supplemental Claim on May 21, 2023 for the same disability. Further, VA then issued a rating decision addressing the claim for service connection for sleep apnea on August 18, 2023. 

Given the evidence that the Veteran was informed of the status of his March 9, 2023 claim, that it was for the same disability as the May 21, 2023, claim, and that the May 21, 2023, claim was filed in response to a VA letter informing the Veteran that he needed to file the same claim on a different form, the Board finds that the Veteran has not explained why a timely appeal was not filed within one year of the August 2023 rating decision or not filed earlier than it was. As noted above, the Veteran was notified of the rating decision issued on August 18, 2023, and within one year of the decision the Veteran filed an intent to file on September 6, 2024, and a request for a copy of documents related to the August 2023 rating decision, submitted on September 11, 2024. Given the above, good cause for an extension of time to file an appeal has not been shown. 

Accordingly, the January 27, 2025 Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to the rating decision issued on August 18, 2023 that denied service connection for sleep apnea, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. The extension request is denied and the attempted appeal is dismissed.
