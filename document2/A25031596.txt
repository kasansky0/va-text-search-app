ORDER

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided from July 6, 2023, to July 25, 2023, is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran received care through the Veterans Community Care Program by an authorized in-network provider from July 6, 2023, to July 25, 2023; the billing process and rates of payment are governed by statutory and contractual authority that does not allow for review by the Board. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical services provided on from July 6, 2023, to July 25, 2023, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1703D, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4030, 17.4035.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1969 to December 1969.

The decisions on appeal were issued in May 2024 by the VA Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical services provided from July 6, 2023, to July 25, 2023, is dismissed.

The Veteran appealed the denial of payment in the May 2024 decisions because the episode of care was authorized under the Veterans Community Care Program.  

At the outset, the record reflects that the Veteran received emergency medical services at a non-VA hospital within the Veterans Community Care Program network of non-VA healthcare providers and the Veteran was authorized to receive medical services under Authorization # VA9005603548 from July 6, 2023, through July 25, 2023. 

VA was directed to enter contracts to establish this network of non-VA healthcare providers to provide sufficient access to medical services.  38 U.S.C. § 1703(h).  This included contracting with a third party administrator to process claims for compensation for the medical services provided by the in-network non-VA healthcare providers.  38?U.S.C. §?1703D(g)(1).  The process for billing for the medical services, including correction of those claims and the rates paid by VA for such services, are governed by the contractual agreements that the provider entered into with VA to be a Community Care Network provider.  38?U.S.C. §?1703D(a)-(g), (i); 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4030, 17.4035. 

Therefore, the governing statute and implementing regulations have established a process for billing medical services furnished through the Veterans Community Care Program that does not contemplate Board review.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1703(h), 1703D; 38 C.F.R. § 17.4030.  

In sum, the applicable statutes and regulations governing the Veterans Community Care Program do not contemplate Board review of a question on whether payment is warranted for in-network medical services provided to the Veteran.  Consequently, the instant appeal seeking payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical services provided from July 6, 2023, to July 25, 2023, must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1703(h), 1703D; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4030, 17.4035.
