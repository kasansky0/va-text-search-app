DOCKET NO. 250205-512858
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and stable angina, to include as secondary to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and insomnia disorder, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The competing lay and medical evidence is in approximate balance regarding whether the Veteran's current cardiovascular disease was incurred in, or otherwise related to his active service, and therefore, the Board resolves the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for cardiovascular disease, to include coronary artery disease and stable angina, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310, 3.326, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.100, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7005.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from January 1963 to July 1964.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2025 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In June 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2024 rating decision.  In September 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued an HLR decision and identified a duty to assist error and issued a separate rating decision in January 2025, the rating decision on appeal.

In the January 2025 rating decision, the RO found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of CAD with stable angina.  The RO also found that the claimed primary disability of insomnia is service-connected, and that he participated in toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), namely that he performed service at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. §?7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. §20.900(c).

The Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  There, the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the time permitted to switch dockets under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has elapsed or the Veteran has waived such time.  In the present case, the decision on appeal was issued on January 16, 2025.  Thus, the one-year period following the decision has not yet elapsed.  However, in this matter the Veteran submitted a motion seeking expedient review of his claim. See February 19, 2025, Motion to Advance on Docket.  Additionally, the decision below represents a complete grant of the benefit sought. See February 2025 VA Form 10182 (requesting "service connection for [CAD] and stable angina").  Thus, given this Veteran's desire for a decision as soon as practicable noted in his filings and that a grant is warranted in this case, the Board concludes there is no prejudice to the Veteran and proceeds with adjudication of the claims.

Applicable Evidentiary Windows

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the June 2024 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2025 AOJ supplemental claim decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for cardiovascular disease, including CAD and stable angina, to include as secondary to his service-connected OSA and insomnia disorder.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for a cardiovascular condition.

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.03.  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in-service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In order to establish direct service connection for the claimed disability, there must be evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In the alternative, establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a)-(b).  Secondary causation exists when, but for the service-connected disability, the non-service-connected was caused by a service-connected disability either in a direct, etiological way or via multiple steps in a causal chain.  Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (citations omitted).  Secondary aggravation exists when the non-service-connected disability not caused by a service-connected disability would be less severe were it not for a service-connected disability.  Id. at 1364.  For example, secondary aggravation may be established where the natural progression of the non-service-connected disability could have been arrested or improved but for the service-connected disability.  Id.

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for certain diseases associated with exposure to contaminants (defined as the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE or PERC), benzene, and vinyl chloride) in the water supply at Camp Lejeune, even though there is no record of such disease during service, if they manifest to a compensable degree at any time after service, in a veteran, former reservist, or a member of the National Guard, who had no less than 30 days (consecutive or nonconsecutive) of service at the United States Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and or Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina, during the period beginning on August 1, 1953, and ending on December 31, 1987. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(7)(iii), 3.309(f).  Subject to the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d), the following diseases shall be service connected even though there is no record of such disease during service: kidney cancer, liver cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, adult leukemia, multiple myeloma, Parkinson's disease, aplastic anemia and other myelodysplastic syndromes, and bladder cancer. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(f).

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.  A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77.

The Board is charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence. Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).  In Jefferson v. Principi, 271 F.3d 1072 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the Federal Circuit Court, citing its decision in Madden, recognized that the Board had inherent fact-finding ability. Id. at 1076; see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  Further, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to weigh and assess the evidence. Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 488-89 (2000); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614, 618 (1992).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) ("[I]f the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance (which includes but is not limited to equipoise), the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt.").

As previously discussed, the AOJ found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis for CAD and stable angina, that his claimed primary disability of insomnia is service-connected, and that he participated in TERA.

The Veteran's service records show that he performed service at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987. See October 2022 Military Personnel Record; see also June 2024 TERA Memo.  As such, he is presumed to have been exposed to contaminants in the water at Camp Lejeune. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(7)(iii).

However, cardiovascular disease is not a condition for which presumptive service connection may be granted based on exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(f).  The Board acknowledges that the absence of a disease from the presumptive list does not preclude the Veteran from otherwise proving, under a direct service connection theory, that his disability resulted from exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for complaints, treatment, or a diagnosis for a cardiovascular condition.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in September 2023, which diagnosed him with CAD and stable angina.  The Veteran reported an onset of 2009 after he felt chest pain and shortness of breath while doing yardwork.  He went to the emergency room and had a stent placed but he experienced the symptoms again in 2014, 2019, 2021, and 2022, requiring additional stents.  He further stated that he is no longer able to walk due to chest pain.  The examiner noted that heart disease is etiologically related to hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  The examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's heart disease was proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected insomnia.  The examiner reasoned studies show that "[p]eople who suffer from insomnia were 69% more likely to have a heart attack compared to those who didn't have the sleep disorder during an average of nine years.  In addition, when looking at sleep duration as an objective measure of insomnia, researchers found that people who clocked five or fewer hours of sleep a night had the greatest risk of experiencing a heart attack."  The examiner also addressed the lay statements of record that supported that the Veteran has had insomnia that preceded his heart disease.

The AOJ requested an addendum medical opinion addressing the September 2023 examiner's reference to the Veteran's heart condition being etiologically related to his hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  The January 2024 addendum opinion, provided by a different examiner, opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's heart disease was proximately due to or the result of Veteran's service-connected insomnia.  The examiner reasoned that CAD and hypertension are separate entities entirely from insomnia and unrelated to insomnia.  The examiner stated she was unable to find medical literature showing a causal relationship.  The examiner stated that the "primary reason that stents are placed are to treat coronary artery disease which is primarily caused by high blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugar levels," and that CAD "is thought to begin with damage or injury to the inner layer of a coronary artery."  The examiner noted various risk factors to include smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or insulin resistance, a sedentary lifestyle, older age, being male, family history, obesity, high stress, and poor diet.  The examiner further noted that various conditions and medications can lead to secondary hypertension, including OSA, kidney disease, adrenal gland tumors, thyroid problems, obesity, congenital defects with blood vessels, certain medications, and illegal drugs.  The examiner found that the Veteran has a history of obesity, hypercholesterolemia, elevated blood sugars, a high stress job as an airline pilot, and that the medical records do not show a diagnosis of insomnia until 2023, which is 14 years after the Veteran required his first stent.

In an October 2024 addendum opinion, the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's heart disease was proximately due to or the result of Veteran's service-connected insomnia.  The examiner reasoned that the Veteran's medical records show a diagnosis for heart disease and obesity in 2009, but do not show a diagnosis of insomnia until 2023.  The examiner also reasoned that the Veteran's obesity is a separate entity and unrelated to insomnia and heart disease, and that she is unable to predict without speculation if his obesity or weight gain caused by insomnia would be a substantial factor in causing the heart disease or that the heart disease would not have occurred but for obesity or weight gain caused by insomnia.  The examiner also found that that it was not at least as likely as not that the Veteran's heart disease was aggravated beyond its natural progression by his insomnia.  The examiner reasoned that the record "does not support evidence of recurrent chronic symptomatology which documents aggravation of [his non-service-connected heart disease] by [his service-connected insomnia]."

The Veteran submitted August 2023 and February 2025 private medical opinions conducted by the same physician. See August 2023 Medical Opinion and February 2025 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.  After a thorough review of lay statements of record and the Veteran's medical treatment records, the physician opined that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's cardiovascular disease and hypertension was caused by and/or aggravated by his service-connected OSA and insomnia disorder.  The physician cited to and reviewed numerous studies in support of her opinion.  For example, the physician discussed studies that showed: (1) OSA and cardiovascular disease have common risk factors, epidemiologic studies show that OSA increases risks for cardiovascular disease independently of individuals' demographic characteristics or risk markers; (2) OSA increases the risk of heart failure by 140%, stroke by 60%, and heart disease by 30%; (3) OSA comprises various pathophysiological triggers for cardiovascular disease; (4) emerging data linking disturbed sleep (including insomnia and short sleep duration) with intermediate mechanisms for heart disease, such as elevations in proinflammatory biomarkers and blood pressure; (5) prospective data suggest that insomnia is associated with an increased incident risk of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary heart disease in patients with insomnia, particularly when coupled with objective measurements of short sleep duration; (6) American Heart Association published findings that individuals with OSA or insomnia are at a significantly greater risk for cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular diseases and they added "sleep" to their list of core health behaviors and health factors that contribute to cardiovascular health; (7) even after adjusting for hypertension, diabetes, and other potential cofounders, short sleep and sleep disturbances contributed to a significantly elevated risk of coronary artery disease; and (8) disease processes related to sleep that may affect blood pressure have the potential to alter cardiovascular morbidity and mortality substantially; among other findings.  The physician then reviewed the September 2023, January 2024, and October 2024 VA examination and opinions and found the January 2024 and October 2024 examiners conclusions were incorrect because they failed to consider the full record that indicated that the Veteran's insomnia had been longstanding prior to him seeking treatment, and that they ignored that he was diagnosed with OSA in 2007, prior to his cardiac diagnosis, and stated the medical literature refutes their conclusions.

The Veteran also submitted a buddy statement from his spouse who indicated that they have been married for over 35 years and the Veteran has complained about difficulties falling asleep since she first met him, thus his sleep disorder existed prior to his heart disease. See August 2023 Buddy/Lay Statement.  She stated he has had insomnia the entire time, and that even after he fell asleep, she has witnessed him waking up shortly after.  She indicated that he was exhausted during the day as a result.

The Board finds that the January 2024 and October 2024 VA addendum opinions are entitled to little weight because they are conclusory, inconsistent with the record, inconsistent with medical literature, and failed to address or discuss the lay statements of record or the private medical opinion or the September 2023 VA examination and opinion.  For example, the addendum opinions failed to consider and discuss the lay statement submitted by the Veteran's spouse and they failed to address and consider his hypertension or his service-connected OSA, even though they found that OSA can lead to secondary hypertension and that high blood pressure is a primary reason that stents are placed.  Additionally, the January 2024 addendum opinion stated they could not find medical literature to support a causal connection but failed to address the numerous studies cited in the August 2023 private medical opinion.  Further, the October 2024 addendum opinion was conclusory in that it found no causal connection, yet the examiner concluded she was unable to predict without speculation if his obesity or weight gain caused by insomnia would be a substantial factor in causing the cardiovascular disease or that the cardiovascular disease would not have occurred but for obesity or weight gain caused by insomnia.  The September 2023 VA examination and opinion and the August 2023 and February 2025 private medical opinions are entitled to great weight as they are consistent with the record, the medical literature, and with each other.

The Board finds the evidence to at least be in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's current cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease and stable angina, was incurred in, or otherwise related to his active service, to include as secondary to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia disorder.  Accordingly, resolving the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran, given that the specific facts and evidence unique to him and his service indicate a causal connection between his obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia disorder with the development of his hypertension and cardiovascular disease, an award of service connection on a direct basis is appropriate. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.
