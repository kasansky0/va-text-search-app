ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral foot disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's bilateral foot disability is related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a bilateral foot disability are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from July 1967 to September 1969. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in July 2024. In October 2024 the Veteran requested review of that decision by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) and selected the Hearing Docket. See October 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge at a virtual hearing in November 2024. The transcript is of record. The evidence available for review is the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 rating decision; the evidence submitted at the November 2024 hearing, to include testimony provided at the hearing; and the evidence, if any, submitted within 90 days of the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran's counsel submitted Privacy Act requests in November 2023 and February 2024, which were fulfilled in May 2024. Ten days later the Veteran's counsel filed another request. However, the Board believes this was done in error as Counsel had not yet been informed that her previous request had been fulfilled. Moreover, as the Board is able to fully grant the Veteran's claim, even if the request is still outstanding, any resulting error would be harmless and the Veteran would not be prejudiced in that regard. As to not further delay fully granting service connection of the Veteran's claim, the Board will proceed with the adjudication of the claim.

Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral foot disability is granted.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection generally requires evidence showing (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran claims that his bilateral foot condition is due to jumping out of airplanes during active service. See November 2024 Board hearing transcript. The Board agrees.

Here, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. See April 2024 VA Examinations. Although the February 2025 private examiner states that, according to the medical record, the Veteran suffers from pes planus, the Board is unable to locate that diagnosis in the record. Significantly, the AOJ has favorably found that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability. See July 2024 Rating decision. Thus, element one of service connection is met.

Regarding element two, in-service incurrence of a disease or injury, the record reflects the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) as that of a medical corpsman. See DD-214. The Veteran asserts that he conducted 15 jumps during active service, which lead to his current bilateral foot pain. The Board finds that due to his MOS it his highly likely that the Veteran would have to jump out of airplanes and is thus consistent with the duties of his MOS, and the Board finds him competent and credible to report the same. See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). Thus, element two of service connection is met. 

For the third element (nexus), there is evidence against and in favor of the claim. Against the claim is the May 2013 VA opinion. The examiner, in opining negatively, opined that he would expect that 15 jumps, without significant injury at any of the jumps, to not be associated with the Veteran's arthritis, and that if the Veteran sustained significant injuries with the parachute jumps, he would expect to have seen more problems many years prior, and it is unlikely the Veteran would have been able to have worked 41 years as an electrician.

Also, against the claim, is the June 2024 VA opinion. The examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral foot condition is not related to service because there are no in-service treatment records noting treatment of the same.

The opinion in favor of the claim was submitted by a private examiner in February 2025. He diagnosed the Veteran with pes planus. The examiner goes into detail relating the Veteran's pes planus to his MOS of paratrooper (although the Veteran's DD-214 states his MOS as a medical corpsman). The significant portion of the opinion discusses how soldiers are subjected to exhausting physical activities during military operations and especially basic training and that given the parachute landings involve repetitive force absorption, often with extreme impact, it is reasonable to conclude that this could contribute to the development of pes plans in paratroopers over time. The examiner reasoned that landing on a surface with greater pressure leads to an increased contact area and higher strain on the foot's arches. The Board will extrapolate from this opinion that it can be applied to someone with arthritis who jumps out of planes, repeatedly and with extreme impact, as part of their duties as a medical corpsman, that their feet can suffer irreparable harm. See Bufkin v. McDonough, 75 F.4 th 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2023) citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979) (stating it is "the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to . . . draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts"); Bastien v. Shinseki, 599 F.3d 1301, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2010)("The evaluation and weighing of evidence and the drawing of appropriate inferences from it are factual determinations committed to the discretion of the fact finder.").

The Veteran testified at the November 2024 Board hearing that he jumped out of airplanes during active service, which caused him to have pain during service and has continued since service. He also testified he has heel spurs, knots, and arthritis and that every day he is in pain.

The Board finds that all of the nexus opinions are inadequate on some basis, to include lack of consideration of the Veteran's lay statements; reliance on the absence of treatment to opine negatively; and basing an opinion on an inaccurate or incomplete factual premise. Additionally, the Board is able to ascertain from the record the Veteran has a current diagnosis, suffered an in-service injury, and that the record is in relative equipoise as to whether or not his current bilateral foot disability is related to service. In resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the third element of service connection is met for the Veteran's bilateral foot disability.

In this regard, a request for another opinion to deny the claim is impermissible. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c) ("The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination"); Gardner-Dickson v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 50, 62 (2020) (denying petition for a writ of mandamus challenging a remand for additional development but agreeing "with the petitioner that it 'would not be permissible for VA to undertake... additional development if a purpose was to obtain evidence against an appellant's case'" (citing Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003) and Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 508 (2007)). See Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021) ("Remand is inappropriate where the predominant purpose is not to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision unencumbered by error but to allow VA to obtain more evidence so that it can properly deny the claim.")

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence is in a state of relative equipoise on the matter of nexus. As the reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for a bilateral foot disability is GRANTED. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
