DOCKET NO. 210607-277663
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided on December 31, 2020, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The non-VA Covid-19 testing performed on December 31, 2020, was provided during a period VA policy allowed for reimbursement of all Covid-19 testing claims for eligible Veterans without a referral or pre-authorization. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the payment or reimbursement of the cost of medical expenses incurred on December 31, 2020, are met. 38 U.S.C. § 1703; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4000-17.4040.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a?non-VA healthcare provider that furnished Covid-19 diagnostic testing services to the Veteran on December 31, 2020, and seeks payment for the services provided.? At that time, the Veteran was enrolled in the VA healthcare system under 38?C.F.R. §?17.37 and is thus considered a "covered veteran" for purposes of the Veterans Community Care Program.  See 38?U.S.C. §?1703; 38?C.F.R. §?17.4005. 

The appellant contends that pursuant to an order from the Veteran's provider, the appellant performed a diagnostic Covid-19 test.  The appellant contents that the VHA denial for lack of prior authorization violates the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act). 

In general, non-VA care and medical services that will be paid for by VA through the Veterans Community Care Program must be authorized in advance.  See 38?C.F.R. §?17.4020.  The Board takes notice that the FFCRA, as amended by the CARES Act, provides that testing for Covid-19 should be free to the patient, as long as the federally declared public health emergency is in effect.  The FFCRA states that coverage must be provided without prior authorization or other medical management requirements. Families First Coronavirus Response Act, Pub. L. No. 116-127, 134 Stat. 178 (2020). 

The Board also notes that prior to January 1, 2021, to expedite Covid-19 testing and services for Veterans, VA decided in 2020 to temporarily reimburse all Covid-19 testing, even those without a VA referral.  After January 1, 2021, claims for reimbursement for Covid-19 testing must be approved by way of VA referral or meet the criteria for emergency eligibility requirements to receive payment. 

The Board takes notice that the Office of Community Care lists their current reimbursement policy for Covid-19 testing claims for eligible veterans. On Community Care's "Covid-19 Guidance for Community Providers" webpage, it specifically states that Veterans may be tested for Covid-19 and paid for by VA when the Veteran meets specific criteria as described by CDC and are enrolled in VA health care or otherwise be eligible for VA care.  The VA will reimburse community providers for Covid-19 testing of eligible Veterans at in-network urgent care locations, in-network community care network providers, if referral or authorization exists, and emergency departments if the visit meets the criteria for VA coverage of emergency care services.  See Covid-19 Guidance for Community Providers, Community Care, Health Care, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/providers/COVID-19_Guidance.asp (last updated March 26, 2025). 

As the COVID-19 diagnostic testing in question was provided in December 2020, prior to January 1, 2021, the announced Community Care Program policy is applicable.  

As such, payment for the cost of the Covid-19 testing provided to the Veteran on December 31, 2020, is warranted; the appeal is granted.
