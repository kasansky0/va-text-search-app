REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from June of 1989 to June of 1993. In September of 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) and initially selected the hearing lane in response to a May 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

While the Veteran did not thereafter testify at a Board hearing before a Veterans Law Judge, the Board observes that he actually attempted to withdraw these claims from the current appeal in correspondence received in September of 2024. However, the claims file reflects that the Veteran was respectively awarded service connection for a left knee condition and right knee condition in a January 2025 rating decision. hus, the pending service connection claims in regard to those issues that are currently before the Board have been rendered moot by the January 2025 rating decision granting service connection for those conditions. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (providing that the Board only decides actual questions of law or fact in an actual case); see also 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (providing that the Board may dismiss any appeal where no specific error of fact or law is alleged). Because this development reflects a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal in regard to those issues, those claims have been rendered moot and the appeal of those issues must be dismissed.
