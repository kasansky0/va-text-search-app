ORDER

The appeal of proposed action to sever service connection for sleep apnea syndromes (obstructive and central sleep apnea) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

An August 8, 2024, rating decision proposed to sever service connection for sleep apnea syndromes; this is not a final, appealable decision as to that matter.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of a proposal to sever service connection for sleep apnea syndromes have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1983 to August 1998.

In the August 15, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected Direct Review docket and identified the issue concerning an award of "sleep apnea syndromes" based "on clear and unmistakable error" which was most recently addressed in an August 8, 2024, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision. As the appeal is being dismissed as a matter of law, a waiver of remaining time to switch the selected review docket is not required to proceed at this time. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); see also Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

The Board acknowledges the Veteran also seeks to appeal February 2023 and May 2023 rating decisions but his August 15, 2024, VA Form 10182, Board Appeal, is not timely as to those rating decisions. See VA Form 10182 (August 2024). A veteran, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed notice of disagreement with a decision by the AOJ within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b). VA regulations provide clear recourse in circumstances when a filing extension is required at 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c), which allows for an extension to be granted "for good cause" if the request is offered in writing and submitted to the Board. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b). To date, the Board has not received such extension request concerning the May 2023 and February 2023 rating decisions. The Veteran is advised that where an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, the action required of the claimant or beneficiary must be taken concurrent with or prior to the filing of a request for extension of the time limit, and good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).

Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).

The propriety of proposed severance of service connection for sleep apnea syndromes. 

The August 8, 2024, rating decision sever service connection for sleep apnea syndromes; however, in the August 12, 2024, notification letter concerning that rating decision, VA informed the Veteran that the decision to sever service connection for sleep apnea syndromes was a proposed decision only. See Rating Decision (August 2024); Proposal to Reduce Service Connected Compensation (August 2024). Thus, the August 8, 2024, rating decision is not a final decision and is not appealable as to that issue. 

In response to the August 2024 proposed severance and deferred determination, the Veteran prematurely filed a VA Form 10182 with the Board and attempted to appeal the proposed severance of his service connected sleep apnea syndrome. See VA Form 10182 (August 2024). However, as noted above, the August 2024 rating decision was only a non-final proposed severance and deferred determination, and it was not an appealable decision as to that matter. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.201; Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458 (2011) (concluding that a deferred rating decision does not constitute an appealable adjudicative action). Accordingly, the Veteran has not identified a specific determination with which he can appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d). Therefore, the appeal of this matter is dismissed.

The Board notes that in a November 2024 rating decision, the AOJ continued service connection for sleep apnea syndrome but a later January 6, 2025 rating decision severed service connection; thus, severance of service connection was not effectuated until April 1, 2025. See Rating Decision (November 2024); Rating Decision (January 2025); Rating Decision Code Sheet (January 2025).
