ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for left cubital tunnel syndrome is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's bilateral peripheral neuropathy is related to in-service exposure to herbicide agents.

2. The evidence is in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome is related to in-service exposure to herbicide agents.

3. The evidence is in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's bilateral left cubital tunnel syndrome is related to in-service exposure to herbicide agents.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral peripheral neuropathy have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

3. The criteria for service connection for left cubital tunnel syndrome have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1979 to April 1995.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In that the decision, the RO readjudicated a previously denied claim for service connection for peripheral neuropathy and denied the claim on the merits.

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy most recently addressed in a November 2023 rating decision.  In May 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

While the Veteran was notified of the AOJ's May 2024 decision on appeal within one year of the issuance of this decision and the opportunity to request a different docket has not fully expired, this decision represents a complete grant of the benefits sought and therefore there is no prejudice to the Veteran in adjudicating the claims on appeal.  Williams vs. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

If a veteran was exposed to herbicide agents (to include Agent Orange) during active military, naval or air service and has contracted an enumerated disease, the veteran is entitled to a presumption of service connection, even though there is no record of such disease during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1112 ; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(e). "Early-onset" peripheral neuropathy is one of the diseases associated with herbicide exposure for purposes of the presumption. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e). VA has determined that a positive association exists between exposure to an herbicide agent and early-onset peripheral neuropathy. For early-onset peripheral neuropathy, the disorder must have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year after the last date on which a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome

Entitlement to service connection for left cubital tunnel syndrome

The Veteran asserts that his peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities is related to his exposure to herbicide agents while he was stationed in Guam during his active military service. 

Initially, in Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009), the Court explained that in determining the scope of a claim, the Board must consider the Veteran's description of the claim, symptoms described, and the information submitted or developed in support of the claim. In light of the Court's decision in Clemons, the Board has recharacterized the claims of service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy; bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome; and left cubital tunnel syndrome. As carpal tunnel syndrome is nerve compression of the median nerve in the wrist and cubital tunnel syndrome is compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow, they will be considered as the disability for which the Veteran sought compensation when he claimed service connection for peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremities.

As favorably found in the May 2024 rating decision, and as noted in a November 2023 VA examination report, the Veteran has current diagnoses of bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy; bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome; and left cubital tunnel syndrome. Therefore, the first element of service connection is met. Additionally, the RO favorably found that the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded per the March 2023 TERA memorandum; STRs show that the Veteran served in Guam during the presumptive period associated with herbicide agent exposure (see 38 U.S.C. § 1116(d)(5)); and the diagnosed disability is a condition that has been presumptively linked to exposure as early onset peripheral neuropathy is presumed to be caused by exposure to herbicides. Therefore, the second element of service connection is also met. 

However, the evidence of record does not document that his peripheral neuropathy of either lower extremity or upper extremity became manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year after the last date on which he was exposed to herbicides agent, here June 1980). The evidence of record also does not show that the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. Thus, the presumptive provisions for service connection do not apply to the Veteran.

Notwithstanding the foregoing presumption provisions for herbicide agent exposure, the Veteran is not precluded from establishing service connection with proof of direct causation for the current peripheral neuropathy. See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

In support of his claim, the Veteran submitted a June 2022 treatment note from his private physician, which stated that "Agent Orange is definitely a contributing factor to the patient's peripheral neuropathy." The Board acknowledges that the private physician did not indicate whether the opinion encompassed the bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy; however, the opinion is somewhat probative. See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012) (the fact that the rationale provided by an examiner "did not explicitly lay out the examiner's journey from the facts to a conclusion," did not render the examination inadequate); Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record).

Additionally, a March 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's left upper extremity peripheral; right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy; left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy; and right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy are at least as likely as not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activities, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.  The Board finds these opinions highly probative. Significantly, there are no contrary medical opinions regarding the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy and in-service herbicide exposure of record.

The Board acknowledges the November 2023 VA opinions that the Veteran's left upper extremity peripheral; right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy; left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy; and right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy are less likely than not due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected hypertension because there is no pathophysiologic relationship between the hypertension and neuropathy. However, as there are positive direct nexus opinions of record, secondary service-connection need not be discussed. 

The evidence of record documents a current diagnosis of bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy; bilateral carpel tunnel syndrome; and left cubital tunnel syndrome, presumed in-service herbicide exposure, and a positive medical opinion linking these disabilities to the presumed in-service herbicide agent exposure. Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively in support of the Veteran's claim for service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy; bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome; and left cubital syndrome, and service connection is warranted on a direct basis.
