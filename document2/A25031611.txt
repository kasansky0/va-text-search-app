REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2014 to September 2022. 

The Veteran filed an intent to file in December 2022, and an original disability claim in April 2023, which was denied by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in June 2024. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for GERD.

2. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.

3. Entitlement to service connection for migraines. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for GERD, an acquired psychiatric disorder, and migraines, which he contends were incurred in or caused by his military service. Specifically, he contends that he began experiencing gastrointestinal/ psychiatric problems as well as chronic headaches during his military service. 

The Veteran's service treatment records (STR) show that he was treated for headaches in February 2014 and gastroenteritis in March 2014. However, in several subsequent records, including an April 2021 Report of Medical History, the Veteran specifically denied gastrointestinal/ psychiatric symptoms as well as chronic headaches.

The Veteran submitted an initial claim for service connection for acid reflux, depression, and migraines in April 2023, less than one year after his discharge from service in September 2022.  At that time, he wrote that he began experiencing symptoms of these disabilities as early as November 2017, during his active service. He related his acid reflux to stress/periods of missed meals, depression to long periods of separation, and migraines to sleep deprivation/stress.

In connection with this claim, the Veteran was afforded VA gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and headache examinations in March and April 2024. Notably, the April 2024 VA examination report shows a diagnosis of GERD symptoms of which began in 2017, during the Veteran's active-duty military service. 

The March 2024 VA psychiatric examination shows diagnoses of unspecified depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. It was noted that the Veteran's psychiatric problems began in 2017, following the suicide of his brother, and that his psychiatric problems were related to back and hip disabilities. It was also noted that, during his active-duty military service he suffered from suicidal ideation without an attempt. 

The April 2024 VA headache examination shows a diagnosis of migraine headaches, symptoms of which began in 2017, during his active-duty military service which gradually increased in severity over time. 

Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds that service connection for GERD, an acquired psychiatric disorder, and migraines is warranted. As an initial matter, the Board finds that the Veteran has current diagnoses of such disabilities as reflected by the March and April 2024 VA examination reports. While no formal medical opinions have been obtained in this case, the March and April 2024 VA examiners each noted that these disabilities began in 2017, during the Veteran's military service, and the Veteran, himself, has reported an onset of these symptoms since this time.  

Given the evidence in this case, the Board declines to remand for an opinion as such would resemble a fishing expedition for negative evidence, which, in view of the available medical evidence, a remand is not necessary. Indeed, obtaining such additional evidentiary development in this instance would only result in additional delay with no benefit to the Veteran. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994); VAOPGCPREC 5-04, 69 Fed. Reg. 59,989 (2004).  

In light of the foregoing, based on the Veteran's competent and credible statements regarding the onset and continuity of symptoms of his GERD, acquired psychiatric disorder, and migraines disabilities, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's GERD, acquired psychiatric disorder, and migraines disabilities had its onset in service. Accordingly, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the claims for service connection for GERD, acquired psychiatric disorder, and migraines, are granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 780-81.
