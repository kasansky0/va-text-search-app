ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for glaucoma with dry eye syndrome is denied.

Entitlement to a separate 10 percent disability, but no higher, effective May 11, 2022, but no earlier, for bilateral dry eye syndrome, is granted. 

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for cataracts as secondary to service connected glaucoma is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's bilateral glaucoma has not resulted in decreased corrected visual acuity worse than 20/20 bilaterally, visual field defects, impairment of muscle function, or incapacitating episodes at any time during the period on appeal.

2. From May 11, 2022, and in resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's bilateral dry eye syndrome was manifested by active symptoms; however, the Veteran did not have any visual impairment, visual field defects, or incapacitating episodes due to his bilateral dry eye syndrome. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for glaucoma with dry eye syndrome have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1-4.14, 4.79, Diagnostic Codes 6013.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a separate 10 percent disability rating, but no higher, effective May 11, 2022, but no earlier, for bilateral dry eye syndrome have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.79, Diagnostic Codes 6018.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1997 to August 2001 and from February 2003 to May 2004.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  Although the Veteran initially requested a Higher-Level Review when submitting a July 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims the Board is granting or denying, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for cataracts as secondary to service connected bilateral glaucoma, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board is also cognizant of the ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  In Rice, the Court held that a claim for a total rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU), either expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record, involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability and is part of the claim for an increased rating.  In this case, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's bilateral eye disabilities impact his ability to work (see March 2022 statement in support of claim); however, the Veteran has not argued, nor does the evidence demonstrate, that his service-connected bilateral eye disabilities render him unemployable.  Additionally, the record does not otherwise reflect that the Veteran is unemployable on account of his service-connected bilateral eye disability.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that a claim for a TDIU has not been raised.    

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for glaucoma with dry eye syndrome.

Entitlement to a separate 10 percent disability rating, but no higher, for bilateral dry eye syndrome, effective May 11, 2022. 

The Veteran was initially granted service connection for bilateral glaucoma in a June 2022 rating decision and assigned a 10 percent disability rating, effective January 13, 2022.  In July 2022, within a year of the June 2022 rating decision, the Veteran sought a higher evaluation.  See July 2022 VA Form 20-0996.  Specifically, the Veteran asserted the AOJ did not apply the bilateral factor calculation and did not consider any incapacitating episodes as detailed in his private treatment records.  See July 2022 correspondence.  The Veteran also asserted additional eye diagnoses were identified that are related to his glaucoma.  See June 2024 VA Form 10182.

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The determination of whether an increased rating is warranted is based on review of the entire evidence of record and the application of all pertinent regulations.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  The Board will consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the claim on appeal.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

Evaluations of defective vision are from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of visual acuity (excluding developmental errors of refraction), visual field, and muscle function.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.76(a), 4.79.  The examination for visual impairment must be conducted by a licensed optometrist or by a licensed ophthalmologist and the examiner must identify the disease, injury, or any other pathologic found.  38 C.F.R. § 4.76(b).  Examination of visual fields or muscle function will be conducted only when there is a medical indication of disease or injury that may be associated with visual field defect or impaired muscle function.  Id.  Unless medically contraindicated, the fundus must be examined with the Veteran's pupils dilated.  Id. 

When both decreased visual acuity and visual field defect are present in one or both eyes and are service connected, the evaluation is determined by separately evaluating the visual acuity and visual field defect (expressed as a level of visual acuity) and combined under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.77(c).

The Veteran is currently rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6013.  DC 6013 provides open angle glaucoma is to be evaluated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Ey with a minimal rating of 10 percent disabling if continuous medication is required. 

The General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye indicates that disabilities are to be evaluated on the basis of either visual impairment due to the particular condition or on incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation.  The evaluation of visual impairment is based on impairment of visual acuity (excluding development errors of refraction), visual fields, and muscle function.  38 C.F.R. § 4.75(a). 

Impairment of Visual Acuity is rated under DCs 6061 through 6066 based on the best corrected distance vision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.76. 4.79.  Where the visual acuity in both eyes is 20/40, a zero (0) percent rating is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79, DC 6066.  A 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/50 and the other eye is 20/50 or 20/40; vision in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/70 and the other eye is 20/40; or vision in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/100 and vision in the other eye is 20/40.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79, DC 6066.   

Impairment of Visual Fields is rated under DCs 6080 through 6081 based on the average concentric contraction of the visual field of each eye; asymmetric impairments are converted to their visual acuity equivalents. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.77, 4.79. Compensable ratings are provided for loss of temporal half of visual field, loss of nasal half of visual field, loss of inferior half of visual field, loss of superior half of visual field, concentric contraction of visual field with the remaining field of at most 60 degrees, or unilateral scotoma. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79. 

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the eye, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 but less than 3 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months.  The next higher evaluation of 20 percent is warranted where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 3 but less than 5 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months.  Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 5 but less than 7 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 40 percent rating is warranted. Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring 7 or more treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 60 percent rating is warranted.  Note (1) states that an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes.  Note (2) provides examples of treatment that include, but are not limited to, systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents, intravitreal or periocular injections, laser treatments, or other surgical interventions.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.79.  Note (3) indicates that, for the purposes of evaluating visual impairment due to a particular condition, refer to 38 C.F.R. § 4.75 to 4.78 and to § 4.79, DCs 6061-6091.  

Additionally, applicable to this case, when chronic conjunctivitis is active, it is to be evaluated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye, and a minimum 10 percent rating is warranted.  When the conjunctivitis is inactive, it is to be evaluated based on residuals, such as visual impairment and disfigurement.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79, DC 6018.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran provided private treatment records from the Mississippi Vision Correction Center, EnVision Eye Care, and Mississippi Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgical Associates.  The private treatment records demonstrate the Veteran's corrected visual acuity was 20/20 for the entire period on appeal.  See March 2021 to October 2022 private treatment records.  The Veteran's private treatment records demonstrate the Veteran is diagnosed with glaucoma and treated with medication.  Id.  The Veteran's private treatment records indicate the Veteran's glaucoma is monitored as directed.  See July 2021 private treatment records.  

The Veteran was initially afforded a VA examination in April 2022.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's diagnosis for primary open angle glaucoma that required continuous medication for treatment.  See April 2022 VA examination.  The Veteran reported his vision had gotten progressively blurrier and he used eye drops to help lower his eye pressure.  Id.  The Veteran's corrected visual acuity was 20/20 or better in both eyes.  Id.  There was no anatomical loss, astigmatism, diplopia, or any visual field defects.  Id.  There were no other diagnosed eye conditions at that time.  Id. There were no incapacitating episodes within the past 12 months or scarring/disfigurement attributable to any eye conditions.  Id.  There was no decrease in visual acuity or other visual impairment attributable to the Veteran's glaucoma.  Id.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's glaucoma did not impact his ability to work.  Id.  

The Veteran was afforded a second VA examination in October 2023.  In addition to glaucoma, the Veteran was also diagnosed with bilateral dry eye syndrome and bilateral cortical cataracts.  See October 2023 VA examination.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's glaucoma was asymptomatic and dry eye syndrome resulted in redness and foreign body sensation.  Id.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral dry eye syndrome on May 11, 2022.  Id.  The Veteran's corrected visual acuity was 20/20 or better in both eyes.  Id.  There was no anatomical loss, astigmatism, diplopia, or any visual field defects.  Id.  There were no incapacitating episodes within the past 12 months or scarring/disfigurement attributable to any eye conditions.  Id.  There was no decrease in visual acuity or other visual impairment attributable to any of the Veteran's eye conditions.  Id.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's glaucoma did not impact his ability to work.  Id.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's office visits within the 12 months prior to his claim were for providing care and managing treatment for his glaucoma.  Id.  The VA examiner noted there were no surgeries, injections, or laser treatment.  Id.  The VA examiner noted medication changes and testing to document glaucoma were reported.  Id.  

After review of the evidence of record, the competent medical evidence of record demonstrates the Veteran's corrected visual acuity was no worse than 20/20 in both eyes.  There is no competent evidence that indicates the Veteran's service connected eye condition results in corrected distance visual acuity warranting a disability rating in excess of 10 percent.  The Veteran has not provided any competent evidence that supports the Veteran's corrected distance visual acuity is worse than 20/20 in either eye to warrant a rating in excess of 10 percent.  Therefore, a rating higher than 10 percent under DC 6066 is not warranted.  

The competent evidence of record does not demonstrate, and the Veteran does not contend, any visual field defects or any impairment of muscle function to warrant a disability rating in excess of 10 percent.  As such, DCs 6080-6081, and 6090-6091 are inapplicable in this case.  

Although the Veteran attends office visits for treatment and monitoring of his glaucoma, the evidence of record does not document incapacitating episodes as contemplated by the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye.  For example, a March 2022 private examiner noted the Veteran must remain diligent to prevent worsening and his treatment records document persistent current care for glaucoma.  See March 2022 correspondence.  None of the Veteran's private treatment records demonstrate the Veteran receives treatment such as systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents, intravitreal or periocular injections, laser treatments, or other surgical interventions.  Both the April 2022 and October 2023 VA examiners determined the Veteran did not have any incapacitating episodes due to any service connected eye disabilities.  As noted, the October 2023 VA examiner affirmed the Veteran's office visits for providing care and managing treatment for glaucoma; however, the VA examiner noted the Veteran did not have any surgeries, injections, or laser treatment.  See October 2023 VA examination.  The VA examiner noted medication changes and testing to document glaucoma were reported.  Id.  As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's eye disability was not severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes as contemplated by 38 C.F.R. § 4.79 to warrant a higher rating.  Therefore, a higher rating based on incapacitating episodes is not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79, DC 6013.  

To the extent the Veteran asserts his bilateral glaucoma warrants a higher rating, the Board notes the Veteran is competent and credible to describe the observable symptoms of his service-connected disability.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, he is not competent to state that his bilateral eye disability warrants a higher rating under DC 6013 because such an opinion requires medical expertise and knowledge that he has not been shown to possess.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  Moreover, the Veteran has not provided any evidence to support the assignment of a higher rating under DC 6013, such as evidence of visual acuity worse than 20/40 in either eye, or incapacitating episodes.  As such, the Board finds the competent medical evidence of record, including the April 2022 and October 2023 VA examinations, are adequate for decision making purposes and entitled to significant probative value.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008).  Therefore, a rating in excess of 10 precent is not warranted at any time during the appeal period for the Veteran's bilateral glaucoma under DC 6013. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, DC 6013.

However, the Board finds that a separate 10 percent disability rating is warranted for dry eye syndrome effective May 11, 2022.  The Board acknowledges that dry eye syndrome is not a disorder specifically listed in the rating schedule and, therefore, it should be rated by analogy to a closely related disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4.27.  Chronic conjunctivitis (DC 6018) and disorders of the lacrimal apparatus (DC 6025) consist of symptoms such as watering of the eyes, redness, and eye discharge, which most closely relate to the Veteran's dry eye syndrome symptoms.  

The evidence demonstrates the Veteran was first diagnosed with bilateral dry eye syndrome in May 2022.  See May 2022 private treatment records.  The evidence of record prior to May 11, 2022 does not demonstrate the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral dry eye syndrome.  For example private treatment records, and the April 2022 VA examination do not demonstrate the Veteran had a diagnosis of bilateral dry eye syndrome.  The October 2023 VA examiner confirmed the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral dry eye syndrome on May 11, 2022, that causes redness and foreign body sensation.  See October 2023 VA examination.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's dry eye syndrome was linked to both the use of glaucoma medications and allergic rhinitis (in which the Veteran is also service connected).  Id.  The VA examiner noted glaucoma drops cause irritation/inflammation of the conjunctiva.  Id.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's bilateral dry eye syndrome did not result in any decrease in visual acuity or other visual impairment.  Id.  The VA examiner also noted the Veteran was not diagnosed with a disorder of the lacrimal apparatus.  Id.  Accordingly, the Board finds it most appropriate that the Veteran's bilateral dry eye syndrome will be rated under DC 6018, by analogy to active chronic conjunctivitis which provides for a minimum 10 percent disability rating.  However, a higher rating is not warranted under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye as the evidence does not demonstrate any decrease in visual acuity, other visual impairment, or incapacitating episodes attributable to his bilateral dry eye syndrome.   

Finally, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that the bilateral factor should have been applied for his bilateral glaucoma.  However, the Board finds there is no basis to apply the bilateral factor to the Veteran's bilateral glaucoma.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.25, 4.26.  Though it is possible to combine different eye disabilities pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.25, such as visual field defect and impairment of visual acuity, separate evaluations are not contemplated by the rating criteria for DC 6013.  Rather, glaucoma, whether in one eye or bilaterally, is collectively rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye with a minimum 10 percent rating warranted for continuous medication.  Separate 10 percent ratings for the left eye and the right eye is not contemplated by the rating criteria under DC 6013.  As separate 10 percent ratings for the left eye and the right eye are not warranted for glaucoma, the bilateral factor does not apply.          

In sum, the evidence is persuasively against a finding that an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent is warranted for bilateral glaucoma; and a separate 10 percent disability rating, but no higher, effective May 11, 2022, but no earlier, for bilateral dry eye syndrome is warranted.  To the extent the Veteran seeks a higher rating, the evidence is persuasively against the claim, and the benefit of the doubt rule is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

The Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 495 (2016); Doucette v. Shulkin, 38 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).     

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for cataracts as secondary to service connected glaucoma is remanded.

Under the AMA, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2)?AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.? See?38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).? The Board finds that remand for pre-decisional?duty to assist errors is necessary as discussed below.

The October 2023 VA examiner noted the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral cortical cataracts.  See October 2023 VA examination.  The VA examiner noted the etiology of the Veteran's cataracts is normal aging, sunlight exposure, and possible link to intranasal steroid use.  Id.  The VA examiner noted that cortical cataracts could be linked to long term steroid use; intranasal or topical steroids are associated with cataracts, elevated IOP, glaucoma, and retinopathy; and that cataracts could also be age related.  Id.  However, the VA examiner did not provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's cataracts are secondary to the Veteran's service connected bilateral glaucoma and dry eye syndrome.  The Board finds that the AOJ had a pre-decisional duty to assist the Veteran with the development of any secondary service connected claim.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 70 (2006); Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 197 (2021).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Forward the record and a copy of this Remand to a clinician for completion of an addendum medical opinion regarding the Veteran's bilateral cortical cataracts.  Schedule the Veteran for an examination only if one is required by the clinician.  After reviewing the Veteran's claims file, the clinician should opine:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that his cortical cataracts are proximately due to or the result of service-connected glaucoma with dry eye syndrome.

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that his cortical cataracts are aggravated (worsened) by service-connected glaucoma with dry eye syndrome. 

A complete rationale should be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical evidence and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner does not have the knowledge or training.
