ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus onset in service, and has persisted since.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1978 to October 1981.

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) review system.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in December 2023.  The December 2023 decision was a supplemental review decision that readjudicated the claims of service connection for tinnitus and for bilateral hearing loss, on the merits, and denied the claims.  The Veteran appealed that decision by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in June 2024.  He elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

VA regulations require that the Board contact an appellant and request clarification if the Board cannot identify which review option an appellant intends to select. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (f).  An NOD may be unclear if an appellant attaches evidence to an NOD indicating that the appellant is seeking Direct Review, as evidence submitted along with an NOD may not be considered by the Board under that review option.  See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023).

In the instant appeal, the Veteran provided statements within the June 2024 VA Form 10182 to the effect that his tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss is due to exposure to heavy equipment and trucks.  This "evidence" was previously before the AOJ at the time of the decision on appeal.  Therefore, the Veteran's statements are posited as errors of application of the law and the argument is properly before the Board, as it is not new evidence.  The present appeal is therefore factually distinguishable from Edwards, and the Board can proceed with a decision without clarifying the Veteran's intent pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (f).

As a final preliminary matter, in June 2024, contemporaneous to the filing of his VA Form 10182, the Veteran submitted a new VA Form 21-22, Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative electing a new representative as noted on the title page.  The Veteran's current representative was not provided with a copy of the July 2024 Board docketing letter.  However, in August 2024, the Veteran's current representative submitted an Appellate Brief in support of the Veteran's appeal.  Such establishes that the Veteran has been afforded representation at all stages of the appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.5.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The determination as to whether these requirements are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and an evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).

For VA compensation purposes, impaired hearing is considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory threshold for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  When audiometric test results at separation from service do not meet the regulatory requirements for establishing a "disability" at that time, a Veteran may nevertheless establish service connection for a current hearing disability by submitting evidence that the current disability is related to service.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 160 (1993).  The threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels.  Id. at 157.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b), where a chronic disease is shown as such in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease are generally service connected; if a chronic disease is noted in service but chronicity in service is not adequately supported, a showing of continuity of symptomatology after separation is required.  

Entitlement to service connection based on chronicity or continuity of symptomatology pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) applies only when the disability for which the Veteran is claiming compensation is due to a disease enumerated on the list of chronic diseases in 38 U.S.C. § 1101 (3) or 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a), which includes sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus as organic diseases of the nervous system.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271 (2015).  In addition, such chronic diseases are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101 (3), 1112 (a) (1), 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a), 3.309 (a).

Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a layperson.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a) (2).  Competent medical evidence is necessary where the determinative question requires medical knowledge.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Competent medical evidence means evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions.  Competent medical evidence may also mean statements conveying sound medical principles found in medical treatises, as well as statements contained in authoritative writings, such as medical and scientific articles and research reports or analyses.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a) (1).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b).  When the evidence persuasively favors against the claims of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable and the claim will be denied on its merits.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Factual Background

Personnel records show that the Veteran had a military occupational specialty (MOS) of motor transport.

In June 1978, the Veteran had an enlistment examination.  The associated audiogram showed hearing acuity pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15	15	5	5	15

LEFT	20	15	5	15	25

In May 1979, the Veteran had a hearing conservation periodic audiometric evaluation.  The associated audiogram showed hearing acuity pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	20	15	10	15	20

LEFT	5	5	0	5	5

In April 1980, the Veteran had another periodic evaluation.  The associated audiogram showed hearing acuity pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15	15	10	10	10

LEFT	15	10	10	10	10

Service treatment records (STRs) further indicate the Veteran underwent audiometric testing in February 1981.  The recordings are difficult for the Board to interpret/decipher. However, an August 2019 VA audiologist indicated "Feb. 1981 showed no changes AU compared to enlistment audiogram from 500-6000 Hz." An October 2023 VA audiologist similarly indicated "hearing WNL on exams on 6/1978, 5/10/1979, 4/20/80, 2/1981, with no STS." A December 2023 VA audiologist noted "normal hearing enlistment 6/1978, 5/1979, 4/1980, and termination exam of 2/1981. No STS in either ear."  In other words, three examiners reviewed the February 1981 audiogram and found that it was normal.

STRs do not include an audiogram contemporaneous to the Veteran's October 1981 separation, as the Veteran indicated at that time, that he did not desire a separation medical examination.

?

The Veteran was provided a VA audiological examination in August 2019, for hearing loss and tinnitus, wherein audiometry revealed that pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:  

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	35	40	40	40	45

LEFT	40	40	35	45	40

While the audiologist diagnosed the Veteran with sensorineural hearing loss in both ears (in frequency range of 500-4000 Hz), the audiologist noted that pure tone results are not valid for rating purposes as the examination indicated non-organic hearing loss.  The audiologist wrote that the speech discrimination scores were 36 percent in the right ear and 32 percent in the left ear, but that the use of speech discrimination scores was not appropriate because of language difficulties, cognitive problems, or inconsistent word recognition scores.  The audiologist noted the Veteran's medical history included a stroke in 2018, that affected the Veteran's left ear.  Further, the audiologist indicated that modified performance intensity on the right and left ears was not obtained because the results were considered unreliable and not commensurate with provided SRT scores, therefore, testing was discontinued. 

The August 2019 VA audiologist furnished negative medical opinions for each ear.  He stated the Veteran's hearing thresholds in the right and left ears were within normal limits at enlistment in June 1978 and at separation in February 1981 without significant shift or decrease during service tenure.  The audiologist stated that if hearing thresholds are normal or there is no evidence of permanent threshold changes during military service, there is no direct evidence of a link between the current hearing loss and in-service events.  See August 2019 VA audiological examination report.  

For tinnitus, the Veteran reported recurrent tinnitus described as a buzzing sound that has been in his ears for 20 years or more.  The audiologist furnished a negative medical opinion citing lack of complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of tinnitus during service; and that despite moderate noise exposure during service, the Veteran reported onset of tinnitus in the 1990's, and not during service.  The audiologist concluded the Veteran's tinnitus was likely related to post-military noise exposure, to included reported manufacturing for over 30 years with hearing protection.  See August 2019 VA audiological examination report.  

In a September 2023 statement, the Veteran reported that he "never said" that his tinnitus onset in the 1990s, "because the onset was in service in 1980."  The Veteran stated that "what I said was in the 1990's it started getting a lot worse not started."  He reported that his in-service duties included driving many different vehicles including ammo carriers and that he was involved in many situations where he was on the live firing ranges with plenty of different types of ammunition to include machine guns and artillery shells.  He stated, "I feel this exposure is a direct result of my bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus and due to my military service and the noises I was exposed to."  

The Veteran was provided a new VA audiological examination in October 2023, for hearing loss and tinnitus, wherein audiometry revealed that pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	55	50	55	70	75

LEFT	75	75	75	70	80

?

The audiologist also diagnosed the Veteran with sensorineural hearing loss in both ears (in the frequency range of 500-4000 Hz), yet noted that pure tone results are not valid for rating purposes as the results were not consistent with speech reception threshold or "3PTA" results.  The audiologist wrote that the speech discrimination scores were 60 percent in the right ear and 26 percent in the left ear, but the use of speech discrimination scores was not appropriate because of language difficulties, cognitive problems, or inconsistent word recognition scores.  

The October 2023 VA audiologist furnished negative medical opinions for each ear.  They stated there was no significant shift in hearing thresholds greater than normal measurement variability from enlistment to separation nor evidence of permanent auditory damage on active duty; there was no record of complaint or treatment of the claimed condition at separation; and that although excessive noise exposure on active duty is conceded, there must be a nexus of auditory damage on active duty to relate current hearing loss to noise on active duty.  The audiologist further remarked that the Veteran's noise exposure during service included noise from trucks, field artillery ammo support, with hearing protection devices provided; and that the Veteran worked with Nestle using hearing protection devices and had no recreational noise exposure.  See October 2023 VA audiological examination report.  

For tinnitus, the Veteran reported recurrent tinnitus that onset in service in 1980-1981 after being with field artillery.  The audiologist furnished a negative medical opinion citing lack of complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of tinnitus during service; and that although excessive noise exposure on active duty is conceded, there must be a nexus of auditory damage on active duty to relate current tinnitus to noise on active duty.  See October 2023 VA audiological examination report.  

?

The Veteran was provided another VA audiological examination in December 2023, for hearing loss and tinnitus, wherein audiometry revealed that pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	25	25	25	25	20

LEFT	20	20	25	25	25

The audiologist noted clear non-organic hearing loss during the 2019 and 2023 audiological examinations.  The audiologist stated that "DPOAES" today indicate normal peripheral hearing in both ears. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) is used to test cochlear function and effectively diagnose or detect hearing loss. See https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3614374/. 

The audiologist noted that thresholds reported 2019 and 2023 were reported to have poor validity.  She further observed that the results would have resulted in significant difficulty communicating with health care providers but that there was no report of hearing difficulty in Veteran's VA medical records.  The audiologist noted the Veteran was told that the results of the DPOAES indicate better hearing than other exams and that he was to respond no matter how soft the tones were so tests could be consistent.  The audiologist found that the pure tone thresholds reported were valid.  The audiologist wrote that speech discrimination could not be tested.  She stated that while speech scores were much better than 2019 and 2023, it was still not valid or consistent with pure tones, DPOAES, or the Veteran's ability to communicate with the examiner, thus, use of speech discrimination scores was not appropriate.

The December 2023 VA audiologist furnished negative medical opinions for each ear.  She stated there is no hearing loss present clinically or according to VA standards in either ear; there is no ratable hearing loss present within a year of separation; and there is no permanent significant shift in hearing thresholds greater than measurement variability from enlistment to separation.  She explained this is objective evidence that although hazardous noise exposure on active duty is reported and conceded, there is evidence of no permanent auditory damage in service from that noise, making any future hearing loss less likely as not related to military service.  Further, the audiologist stated that a TERA opinion is not warranted because there is no diagnosis of hearing loss and research does not support a causal relationship between TERA, exposures from MOS of motor transport, and hearing loss.  See December 2023 VA audiological examination report.  

For tinnitus, the Veteran reported recurrent tinnitus described as ringing in both ears, more often in the right ear, that began on active duty after being on the firing range.  The audiologist furnished a negative medical opinion cited to a lack of complaint or treatment for tinnitus in the Veteran's STRs; evidence of no chronicity or continuity of care regarding tinnitus since military separation; and that although excessive noise exposure on active duty is conceded, tinnitus onset is reported to be in service, and the relationship between noise exposure and tinnitus is well documented, auditory damage, tinnitus, and noise as etiology of tinnitus are not conceded from hazardous noise alone.  The audiologist explained there must be a nexus of auditory damage on active duty to relate the current report of tinnitus to noise on active duty, thus objective evidence is against a nexus in this claim.  Further, the audiologist stated that a TERA opinion is not warranted because research does not support a causal relationship between tinnitus and toxic exposures.  See December 2023 VA audiological examination report.  

The Board will now review the tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss claims.

(a) Tinnitus

The Veteran is competent to identify tinnitus, as ringing in the ears is readily observable by lay persons and does not require medical expertise to establish its existence.  Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002).  The AOJ also made the favorable finding in the December 2023 decision on appeal that the Veteran has a diagnosis of tinnitus.  There is no basis to rebut the AOJ's favorable finding; therefore, the finding is binding on the Board.  

STRs do not show any complaints or treatment for tinnitus.  Personnel records do show the Veteran had a MOS of motor transport.  Moreover, the Veteran's exposure to hazardous noise during service was conceded to by the October 2023 and December 2023 VA audiologists.  The Veteran has also given several reports about his recollections of military noise exposure.  See September 2023 statement.  As the Veteran's statements about military noise exposure incidents are consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service, the Board finds them credible.  Military occupational noise exposure is thereby conceded. 

The August 2019, October 2023, and December 2023 VA medical opinions weigh against the claim.  The Veteran states the August 2019 VA examiner misinterpreted his statement that his tinnitus had worsened, not onset, in the 1990's. The October 2023 and December 2023 VA medical opinions appear to implicitly reject the Veteran's report about symptoms starting in service based upon a lack of contemporaneous medical treatment or medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336, n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (noting that VA's examiner's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the Veteran's] disability such that his claim for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence").  Moreover, unlike hearing loss disability, which must be established by specific testing, tinnitus is a disability that is diagnosed based on self-reports (by the person experiencing it) and is generally incapable of objective confirmation.  See Charles, supra.  With these limitations, the October 2023 and December 2023 VA medical opinions are not persuasive to weigh against a relationship to service through continuous symptoms beginning in service.  

It is not in dispute that the Veteran has tinnitus.  Tinnitus is an inherently subjective disability and is, therefore, readily capable of lay diagnosis.  See Charles, supra. Additionally, as noted, tinnitus is a disease that can be established by showing continuity of symptomology.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).  What the Board must decide is a question of the credibility of the Veteran's accounts that his tinnitus began in service and has persisted since.

Here, the Board finds the Veteran has competently and credibly reported throughout the review period that his tinnitus began in service and has continued since that time.  The Veteran has reported that his tinnitus onset in 1980, during service.  He further reported that his tinnitus worsened in the 1990's, which appears to indicate that his symptoms persisted after service.  See September 2023 statement. Moreover, his reports are consistent with the other evidence of record.  When examined by VA in October 2023 and December 2023, the Veteran reported that his tinnitus onset in service, after being on the firing range.  There is nothing in the record (such as a denial of tinnitus during the intervening periods since service) that directly contradicts his reports of continuity, so as to render them not credible.  The Board has no reason to question the credibility of the Veteran's accounts that his tinnitus became manifest in service and has persisted since.  

Thus, after considering the evidence of record to include the Veteran's competent and credible reports regarding onset during service, and continuous symptoms of tinnitus since service, and resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor (as mandated, see 38 C.F.R. § 3.102), the Board finds that the onset of tinnitus in service with continuity since service has been shown.  Service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  

(b) Bilateral Hearing Loss

For the following reasons, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted as the evidence of record does not demonstrate that the Veteran had bilateral hearing loss for VA disability compensation purposes during or approximate to the appeal period.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

In the December 2023 decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability, stating that "the VA examiner diagnosed you with bilateral hearing loss."  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).  The August 2019 and the October 2023 VA audiologists provided a diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (in the frequency range of 500 to 4000 Hertz).  

Under the AMA, a favorable finding by an AOJ is binding on the Board unless it is rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104 (c), 20.801(a).

There is a three part test for clear and unmistakable error: (1) either the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were not before the adjudicator (i.e., there must be more than a simple disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated) or the statutory or regulatory provisions extant at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the error must be undebatable and of the sort which, had it not been made, would have manifestly changed the outcome at the time it was made; and (3) a determination that there was clear and unmistakable error must be based on the record and law that existed at the time of the prior adjudication in question.  See Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310 (1992); see also Bustos v. West, 179 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (to prove the existence of clear and unmistakable error as set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a), the claimant must show that an outcome-determinative error occurred, that is, an error that would manifestly change the outcome of a prior decision).

Clear and unmistakable error is a very specific and rare kind of error.  It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.  Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993).  Clear and unmistakable errors "are errors that are undebatable, so that it can be said that reasonable minds could only conclude that the original decision was fatally flawed at the time it was made."  Russell, 3 Vet. App. at 313.

A determination of clear and unmistakable error must be based on the record and the law that existed at the time of the prior adjudication.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); Caffrey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 377 (1994).

With regard to requests for revision based on clear and unmistakable error, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable.  Andrews v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 177, 186 (2004) (citing Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310 (1992)) (The benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable in assessing a clear and unmistakable error motion because the nature of such a motion is that it involves more than a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated).

In the Federal Register, it was noted that the clear and unmistakable standard applicable to rebuttal is similar to the definition of clear and unmistakable error found in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a) (1) (i) and 38 C.F.R. § 20.1403 (a) that applies to finally adjudicated issues.  However, application of the clear and unmistakable standard for rebuttal of a favorable finding is legally distinct because, for instance, it is limited to the scope of the favorable finding itself and does not require a further determination that the outcome of the benefit adjudication would undebatably change.  The clear and unmistakable rebuttal standard may be satisfied by a finding that the evidentiary record as a whole completely lacks any plausible support for the favorable finding.  See 84 FR 138, 141-42 (Jan. 18, 2019).  Indeed, the Board so finds in this case for the reasons discussed below.

To the extent that the AOJ's favorable finding that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability based on the August 2019 and the October 2023 VA audiological examination reports, this finding was clearly and unmistakably erroneous.  In this regard, while August 2019 and the October 2023 VA audiologists noted a diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (in the frequency range of 500 to 4000 Hertz), both examiners indicated that the pure tone results are not valid for rating purposes, and that the use of speech discrimination scores was not appropriate for the Veteran.  Accordingly, they cannot be used to establish a present hearing loss disability. 

Moreover, additional testing was undertaken by the December 2023 VA audiologist, who found that "DPOAES" indicated normal peripheral hearing in both ears, and found the pure tone thresholds reported to be valid.  The audiologist found that while speech scores were much better than 2019 and 2023, it was still not valid or consistent with pure tones, DPOAES, or the Veteran's ability to communicate with examiner, thus, use of speech discrimination scores was not appropriate.  There are no indications that the December 2023 VA examiner did not perform their duties correctly, and the Veteran has not asserted that they erred in any way.  

There is no contrary, competent evidence establishing a bilateral hearing loss disability that has been presented or identified.  The Veteran has not reported that he was diagnosed with right or left ear hearing loss at any time, nor has he indicated that he has received any treatment for his hearing, either through a private provider or VA.  VA treatment records show no reports of difficulty hearing or treatment for hearing loss.  Indeed, the Veteran made no report to his VA providers of decreased hearing, hard of hearing, or hearing aids.  See December 2020, March 2021, October 2022, and June 2023 VA treatment records.  There is no other evidence in any of the Veteran's medical records that he has ever had, at any time, a hearing loss disability under 38 C.F.R. §3.385 in either ear.

As such, this error was undebatable as the record lacked any plausible support for the favorable finding such that it represents an incorrect application of the relevant regulatory provision to the facts from the August 2019 and the October 2023 VA audiological examination reports.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board concludes that the AOJ's favorable finding of a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss is rebutted by the evidence showing that the finding was clearly and unmistakably erroneous.  As such, this favorable finding is not binding on the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The existence of a current disorder is a required element of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.2d 1328, 1332 (1997); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  

VA regulation specifically defines the parameters of a hearing loss disability for compensation purposes, and the Veteran in this case does not meet the criteria for establishing a current disability.  Id.  Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability.  In the absence of proof of present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer, at 225; see also McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  

Even if the Board were to accept there was some damage to the Veteran's ears during service, as service connection for tinnitus has hereinabove been granted, there is no evidence of a hearing loss disability in-service or within one year of service.  The Veteran has not alleged that he either had hearing loss in service, or within one year of service.  Moreover, the Veteran does not provide any report about when he began experiencing or noticing impaired hearing symptoms suggestive of hearing loss.  None of the VA audiologists attributed tinnitus to hearing loss or otherwise indicate it was a symptom of hearing loss.  Accordingly, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding continuous symptoms since service or a continuity of symptomatology.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

There is also no evidence whatsoever that links a hearing loss disability to service.  None of the VA audiologists found a positive nexus of a hearing loss disability to service.  Moreover, when reading the December 2023 VA medical opinion as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record, the audiologist did not find sufficient evidence to link a hearing loss disability to in-service noise exposure or to service.  They explained that the hearing acuity shifts from the military audiograms were within the normal measurement variability and found that acoustic trauma was not sustained, and that there was no hearing loss within one year of service.  Their opinion is, therefore, entitled to some probative weight.  See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012) (the fact that the rationale provided by an examiner "did not explicitly lay out the examiner's journey from the facts to a conclusion," did not render the examination inadequate); Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 293 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record).

There is no conflicting medical opinion or competent evidence otherwise linking a hearing loss disability to service.  Moreover, the Veteran has not alleged that he has been told by a medical provider that he has a current hearing loss disability that is related to service.    

While the Veteran has stated that he believes a hearing loss disability was caused by exposure to noise in service, these lay assertions do not constitute probative medical evidence.  The Veteran is competent to describe events that occurred during military service and any symptomatology regarding his perceived hearing loss, but as a lay person, he is not competent to provide a medical diagnosis of hearing loss, as such requires medical testing, or to determine the etiology of hearing loss.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting general competence to testify as to symptoms but not to provide medical diagnosis).  Hearing loss can have many causes, and whether the loud noises the Veteran was exposed to in service are in any way related to a hearing loss disability requires medical expertise to determine.  See Clyburn v. West, 12 Vet. App. 296, 301 (1999).  

The Board also acknowledges that the December 2023 VA audiologist indicated that a TERA opinion was not provided.  VA is now required to provide a disability examination and/or obtain a medical opinion when a Veteran submits a claim for compensation and has: (1) evidence of a disability, and (2) participation in a TERA, but the evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a).  

The Veteran participated in toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).  See November 2023 VA Memorandum.  However, the Veteran has not asserted that a hearing loss disability is related to environmental toxins.  Instead, the Veteran's hearing loss is claimed to have been caused by noise exposure.  Moreover, as there is no current diagnosis for VA purposes, a TERA examination would not have been warranted.

As a bilateral hearing loss disability is not shown at any time during the applicable appeal period, or proximate thereto, service connection for bilateral hearing loss cannot be granted.  See?38 C.F.R. §§?3.303, 3.385; Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1995) (Congress specifically limited entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents had resulted in a disability); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).  The evidence for the claim versus the evidence against this claim is not in "approximate" balance (i.e., nearly equal).  Instead, the most probative and, therefore, most persuasive evidence is against the claim.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.
