REMANDED

The issue of whether the character of the appellant's discharge from service is a bar to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits, to include healthcare under Chapter 17, Title 38, United States Code, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The appellant had active duty service with the United States Navy from July 1966 to July 1971; the character of discharge is the subject of this appeal.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision by a VA Regional Office (RO).

In March 2025 the appellant submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

In this regard, the Board notes for the AOJ that the appellant has submitted new evidence that his period of prolonged AWOL, following which the appellant accepted a discharge in lieu of trial by general court martial, was due to him "fear[ing] for his life."  See March 2025 Statement; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(b).

The issue of whether the character of the appellant's discharge from service is a bar to VA benefits, to include health care under Chapter 17, Title 38, United States Code, is remanded.

The appellant essentially seeks 'veteran' status.  He contends that the character of his discharge should not act as a bar to the receipt of VA benefits as he experiences a mental health disorder. 

The appellant entered active duty on June 25, 1966.  During service, was awarded nonjudicial punishments in March and April 1967 for drinking as a minor and prejudicial conduct, respectively.  

He was convicted by summary court martial in October 1967 for violation of Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 86 for unauthorized absences from July 24, 1967 to July 27, 1967 and from August 7, 1967 to September 1967; and violation of UCMJ Article 92 for failure to obey a lawful order.  He was also convicted by summary court martial for violation of UCMJ Article 86 for an unauthorized absence from May 21, 1969 to June 19, 1969.  

The service record indicates that the appellant was AWOL from October 14, 1969 to January 26, 1971 and from March 10, 1971 to March 8, 1971.  The appellant was discharged under other than honorable conditions by reason of acceptance of a discharge in lieu of general court martial on July 20, 1971.  See Military Personnel Record (added to the claims file April 1979) (indicating that [d]elay in executing the discharge ... shall be explained in writing to the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction).

On October 28,1977, under the Department of Defense (DOD) special discharge review program, the appellant's discharge was upgraded to general, under honorable conditions.  During these proceedings the appellant testified that during his prolonged period of AWOL he was having a very difficult time.  His wife was pregnant and his parents wanted her to get an abortion.  The marriage ended in divorce.  He explained that because of the animosity between his and his wife's families he felt he could not return even long enough to apply for a hardship discharge.  He asserted that he may not have been prepared to enlist and thought that he would not react now the same way as he did then.  "[H]e felt that he was needed at home and any continuation of his service was pointless." 

In July 1978, the Department of the Navy Discharge Review Board determined that the appellant did not qualify for an upgrade. 

In March 2025, the appellant argued that he was punished during service as a Whistleblower which led to his AWOL as he feared for his life.  But see Military Personnel Record (added to the claims file July 2023) (indicating that the appellant, in violation of a direct order, wrote a letter which divulged specific classified information, but was not put on report, brought to mast, nor was any disciplinary action taken as a result). 

Following a review of the record, for the reasons detailed below, the Board finds that a remand is necessary in order to address a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  

First, the Board notes that in a June 2023 decision, this matter was remanded for the AOJ to attempt to obtain complete service personnel records from the appropriate repositories, to include the NPRC and the Service Department.  Although the AOJ contacted the NPRC, there is no indication that the AOJ attempted to obtain the missing records from the Service Department.  As such, another remand is warranted.

Next, in December 2022, in response to a character of discharge development letter, the appellant requested that VA provide a new administrative review of his character of discharge, given that the most recent administrative decision in this case is dated May 1979 and held only that the appellant is barred from eligibility for VA benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(c)(6).  

The Board agrees that a new administrative decision is warranted in this case.  In June 2024, VA issued an amendment to the regulation governing character of discharge.  See Update and Clarify Regulatory Bars to Benefits Based on Character of Discharge, 89 Fed. Reg. 32,361 (April 26, 2024) (codified at 38 C.F.R. § 3.12).  In the Federal Register notice announcing the amendments to the regulation governing character of discharge, VA specified that any claimant with a prior unfavorable character of discharge determination may request a new determination using the amended regulations.  Update, 89 Fed. Reg. 32,361, § V.  Based on the foregoing, on remand, the AOJ should issue a new administrative decision with regard to the appellant's character of discharge.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Contact the appropriate repositories, to include (but not limited to) the Service Department, and request a complete service record, to include any DD-214s, charge sheets, referral of charges, requests for discharge, disposition forms pertaining to the appellant's administrative separation in lieu of general court martial, and discharge upgrade applications and determinations.

2. Issue a new character of discharge determination made using the revised provisions of the character of discharge regulation. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(c)(6) (prolonged AWOL), (d)(1)(i) (acceptance of a discharge in lieu of trial by general court martial).

In doing so, the AOJ should consider the appellant's March 2025 Statement and the March 2012 private medical opinion.
