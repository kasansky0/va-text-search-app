DOCKET NO. 240723-458674
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for loss of teeth is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have a current dental disorder that qualifies for VA disability compensation purposes, as loss of teeth is not a disability for which compensation benefits are payable.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for loss of teeth have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.381, 4.150, 17.161.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had honorable service in the United States Navy from November 1986 to November 1990 and from March 1991 to March 2007.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2024 rating decision.  In June 2024 the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2024 decision.  In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for loss of teeth is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for loss of teeth, which he asserts is the result of poor dental work done during service.

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Generally, to prove service connection there must be: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Compensation is only available for certain types of dental and oral conditions, such as impairment of the mandible, loss of a portion of the ramus, and loss of a portion of the maxilla.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.150.  Treatable carious teeth, replaceable missing teeth, dental or alveolar abscesses, and periodontal disease are not disabilities for compensation purposes, but may be considered service-connected solely for the purpose of establishing eligibility for outpatient dental treatment.  38 U.S.C. § 1712; 38 C.F.R. § 3.381.  Missing teeth may be compensable for rating purposes only where there is bone loss through trauma or disease such as osteomyelitis.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Code 9913.  However, the Note immediately following states "these ratings apply only to bone loss through trauma or disease such as osteomyelitis and not to the loss of the alveolar process as a result of periodontal disease, since such loss is not considered disabling."  Id.

To establish entitlement to service connection for loss of a tooth, the Veteran must have sustained a combat wound or other in-service trauma.  38 U.S.C. § 1712; 38 C.F.R. § 3.381(b).  The significance of finding that a dental condition is due to in-service trauma is that a veteran will be eligible for VA outpatient dental treatment, without being subject to the usual restrictions of a timely application and one-time treatment.  38 C.F.R. § 17.161(c).

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that service connection for loss of teeth is not warranted.  In this regard, service treatment records reveal the Veteran's wisdom teeth, numbers 1, 16, 17 and 32, were extracted prior to entrance.  During service, Veteran had treatment on various teeth during service for dental caries, broken teeth, periodontitis, and subgingival calculus.  However, service treatment records do not contain evidence suggesting treatment for either a traumatic injury to the body of the maxilla or mandible, impairment of the mandible, loss of a portion of the ramus, loss of a portion of the maxilla, or a dental disease other than a periodontal disease.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in February 2024, during which the examiner indicated that the Veteran had a diagnosis of loss of teeth, which the examiner noted was due to periodontal disease and dental caries during service which ultimately led to extraction.  The examiner noted the Veteran was missing teeth 1, 16, 17, 18, 30, 31, and 32.  The examiner did not find that the Veteran had diagnoses of impairment of the mandible, loss of a portion of the ramus, loss of a portion of the maxilla, loss of teeth due to loss of substance of the body of the maxilla or mandible or TMJ.  The examiner further noted that the Veteran's masticatory surfaces can be restored by suitable prosthesis, explaining that the Veteran requires extensive treatment for existing oral conditions but a removable partial denture can be fabricated.  The Board acknowledges that the examiner opined that the Veteran's loss of teeth was incurred in or caused by service.  However, the examiner explained that the Veteran's missing teeth of the right lower quadrant are a direct result of inadequate and sporadic treatment.  

As noted above, compensation is not available for treatable carious teeth, replaceable missing teeth, dental or alveolar abscesses, and periodontal disease are not disabilities for compensation purposes.  Here, the evidence fails to show the Veteran experienced dental trauma during service, and there is no evidence he has a diagnosis of a qualifying dental disability under 38 C.F.R. § 4.150 or experiences functional impairment.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the most probative evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran's claimed loss of teeth was incurred in or caused by service.

In reaching the above conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine; however, as the competing evidence is not in approximate balance, the doctrine is not for application.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
