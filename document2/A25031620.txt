ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for migraine disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's migraine headaches is secondary to, related to and aggravated by his service connection bilateral tinnitus condition.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches as secondary to service-connected tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1154, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1999 to October 1999 and October 2001 to October 2002.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service. 38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303. 

Service connection is also warranted for a disability proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Such secondary service connection is warranted for any increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b).

Entitlement to service connection for migraine.

The Veteran contends that his migraines disability is due to his service-connected tinnitus. Specifically, he argues that "the tinnitus causes [him] stress and this often precedes [his] headaches [and] due to lack of sleep caused by [his] tinnitus [he] has morning headaches."

The Veteran is currently diagnosed with migraine headaches. See June 2022 VA Examination. The key inquiry is whether this disability was caused by his service connection tinnitus.

To that end, in a positive nexus opinion on July 25, 2023, a private physician, D.L., stated the Veteran's migraine headaches are at least as likely as not secondary to, related to, and/or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected bilateral tinnitus condition.  As rationale, the private clinician pointed to medical literature that supported a causality relationship between the symptomatology of headaches in relation to tinnitus. The private physician referenced medical opinions, conducted a thorough review of the Veteran's medical records, his current diagnosis and medical literature in support of the nexus rationale upon the pathophysiological neural mechanisms and processes along with the Veteran's lay statements in support of the claim. The private examiner's opinion was based on full consideration of the pertinent lay and clinical evidence of record and is supported by sufficient reasons for conclusions offered. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). Accordingly, the Board assigns significant probative weight to the July 25, 2023, private medical opinion. 

In the September 2023 negative nexus opinion, the VA examiner conclusively stated that "(t)he conditions of Migraine/Headaches and Tinnitus are not medically related. The Migraine/Headaches is a separate entity entirely from the Tinnitus and unrelated to it" without adequate explanation or addressing aggravation. The VA examiner addressed the direct basis, yet the examiner relied on the silence of migraine headaches during service and did not account for the Veteran's competent report of such symptoms during and since then. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). For these reasons, the Board assigns minimal probative weight to the opinion.

Accordingly, as the July 2023 opinion is the most probative opinion evidence of record and relates the claimed migraine headaches disability to the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus, the Board resolves all reasonable doubts in the Veteran's favor and grants service connection for migraine headaches. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
