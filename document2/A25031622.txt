ORDER

The appeal as to whether termination of nonservice-connected pension benefits, effective November 1, 2015, was proper is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a March 2024 Notification Letter from the Debt Management Center (DMC), the Veteran was informed that the pension debt of $96,043.00 was created due to a data quality issue, which impacted the Income Match program between VA and the Social Security Administration (SSA).  The letter also informed the Veteran that VA would not collect the pension debt because the debt was effectively invalid.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal regarding the termination of nonservice-connected pension benefits, effective November 1, 2015, is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 19.55.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1972 to December 1975.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2023.  In June 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, choosing to continue his appeal via Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  Direct review is the appeal option to the Board in which a Board decision is issued based on evidence of record at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a hearing or accept into the record additional evidence in its direct review.

Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.

Analysis 

In March 2011, the Veteran was awarded nonservice-connected pension benefits.  

In December 2022, VA informed the Veteran that it received information from SSA which showed he had been receiving SSA benefits in September 2015.  As this increased the Veteran's countable income, VA proposed to retroactively terminate the Veteran's pension benefits from November 1, 2015, the date VA began counting the SSA benefits.  

In February 2023, VA effectuated the termination.  The DMC assessed a debt of $96,043.00.  The withholding was scheduled to begin in August 2023.

On May 23, 2023, the Veteran requested a waiver of the overpayment.  On May 25, the waiver was granted in full.  However, in July 2023, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0226, Request for Higher Level Review.  He requested full rate and no reduction in his pension benefits.  In August 2023, the AOJ confirmed the overpayment as was explained in the February 2023 Notification Letter.  The Veteran disagreed with the decision.  

Although outside the period on appeal, in March 2024, DMC informed the Veteran that VA had experienced a "data quality issue" which impacted VA's ability to verify the Veteran's eligibility for pension benefits.  This issue impacted the "Income Match program" between SSA and VA.  After the SSA Income Match was reestablished, VA created a debt on the Veteran's pension account based on updated SSA income information.  VA informed the Veteran that it would not collect this pension debt and had reduced his debt amount accordingly.  VA added if the Veteran had already made payments based on the previous debt notice, he would be refunded the amount.  VA noted the "original" debt balance of $96,043.00 and updated the "current" debt balance to $0.00.  The DMC letter notified the Veteran that the debt was effectively found invalid, and the Veteran did not owe any money.    

Therefore, as the termination was determined to be improper and no overpayment remained, there is no justiciable case or controversy because the benefit sought on appeal was effectively granted in full.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205
