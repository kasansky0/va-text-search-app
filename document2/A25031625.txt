DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 2, 2019, but no earlier, for service-connected chronic fatigue syndrome is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's claim for service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been pending since receipt of a May 2, 2019, fully developed claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of May 2, 2019, but no earlier, for the grant of service-connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from December 1986 to December 1996, and from August 2008 to February 2009, with additional service in the Reserve. He was awarded the Air Force Achievement medal, among other decorations. The Veteran had service in Southwest Asia.

In an April 2024 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction denied an earlier effective date for service-connected chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and denied an increased rating in excess of 40 percent.  In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 2, 2019, but no earlier, for service-connected chronic fatigue syndrome

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an earlier effective date due to continuously pursuing his claim. See July 2024 NOD. As the Veteran specifically cited to an earlier effective date and did not discuss or contend to a higher rating, it is not before the Board and will not be discussed. Id.

Generally, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. In the AMA, a claimant may continuously pursue a claim, thereby preserving the effective date of the first claim in the continuously-pursued chain, by timely and properly filing one of the review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1)-(4) after any decision by the AOJ, Board, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claim, or the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

The AMA applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2. 

The Board notes that the Veteran was granted service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome based on the PACT Act presumption that became law on August 10, 2022, the effective date of his CFS. However, consideration has not been given to a date prior to the PACT Act.

Prior to the PACT Act, service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for a Persian Gulf Veteran who exhibits objective indications of qualifying chronic disability, including resulting from undiagnosed illness, that became manifest either during active service in the Southwest Asia (SWA) theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, or to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than December 31, 2026, and which by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis. 38 U.S.C. §1117; 38 C.F.R. §3.317 (a)(1). a qualifying chronic disability means a chronic disability resulting from any of the following (or any combination of the following): (a) an undiagnosed illness; or (b) a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness (MUCMI) that is defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms, such as: (1) chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS); (2) fibromyalgia; or (3) functional gastrointestinal disorders (excluding structural gastrointestinal diseases). Id. Such chronic disability must not be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis by history, physical examination, or laboratory tests. Id.; see also Stewart v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 383, 389 (2018) (holding that under 38 C.F.R. §3.317, "an illness is a MUCMI where either etiology or pathophysiology of the illness is inconclusive"). VA is authorized to pay compensation to any Persian Gulf veteran suffering from a "qualifying chronic disability." Id. 

Conversely, a multi-symptom illness with, at the minimum, both a partially understood etiology and pathophysiology is not a MUCMI. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(ii). To fulfill the requirement of chronicity, the illness must have persisted for a period of six months. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(2), (3). Signs or symptoms that may be manifestations of undiagnosed illness include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) fatigue; (2) signs or symptoms involving skin; (3) headache; (4) muscle pain; (5) joint pain; (6) neurologic signs or symptoms; (7) neuropsychological signs or symptoms; (8) signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or lower); (9) sleep disturbances; (10) gastrointestinal signs or symptoms; (11) cardiovascular signs or symptoms; (12) abnormal weight loss; and (13) menstrual disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (b). 

Compensation shall not be paid, however, if there is affirmative evidence that an undiagnosed illness was not incurred during active military, naval or air service in the SWA theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War; or if there is affirmative evidence that an undiagnosed illness was caused by a supervening condition or events that occurred between the appellant's most recent departure from active duty in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War and the onset of the illness; or if there is affirmative evidence that the illness is the result of the appellant's own willful misconduct or the abuse of alcohol or drugs. 38 U.S.C. §1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(c). If an examiner has determined the Veteran's disability pattern to be either a diagnosable chronic multi-symptom illness with a partially explained etiology, or a disease with a clear and specific etiology and diagnosis, then service connection cannot be granted under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 and may only be granted if the medical evidence is sufficient to establish service connection on a direct basis. See generally Combee v. Principi, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (1994).

In claims based on qualifying chronic disability, unlike those for "direct service connection," there is no requirement that there be competent evidence of a nexus between the claimed illness and service. Gutierrez v. Principi, 19Vet. App.1, 8-9 (2004). Notably, laypersons are competent to report objective signs of illness.

The Veteran filed his claim for unexplained chronic multi-system illness as a Gulf War Veteran in May 2019. The Veteran's service personnel records confirm that he served in the SWA theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War. He was awarded a Southwest Asia Service medal. Therefore, he qualifies for consideration for presumptive service connection for disabilities resulting from an undiagnosed illness or MUCMI.

In the September 2019 rating decision issued by the AOJ, service connection for CFS was denied because there was no evidence of an event, disease or injury inservice nor of a current diagnosed disability. The Veteran was not offered a VA examination. The Veteran appealed the decision, and a February 2021 Board decision denied service connection as he did not report any signs or symptoms he may experience associated with these conditions and medical records do not support the conclusion that any of these symptoms have ever been chronic or manifested to a compensable level. 

In May 2021, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for CFS secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 

In June 2021, the Veteran was provided a VA examination for his CFS claim. The Veteran described symptoms as extreme fatigue performing any activity. Additionally, he reported symptoms of nonexudative pharyngitis, generalized muscle aches or weakness, fatigue lasting more than 24 hours after exercise, headaches, and sleep disturbance. The examiner found a diagnosis of CFS was present. When asked for an opinion as to whether the CFS was secondary to PTSD, the examiner stated it was more likely due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 

In July 2021, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim again asserting he had a current CFS diagnosis that was related to his service in the Gulf war. 

In October 2021, the Veteran presented for a second VA examination for his CFS claim. He reported symptoms of sleep disturbances and headaches. The examiner did not diagnose him with a CFS disability. Instead, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with an undiagnosed illness. As such, the examiner did not provide a rationale as the diagnosis on the questionnaire did not require a rationale as an undiagnosed illness is presumed to be caused by service in Southwest Asia.  

The AOJ continued denial of the claim in an October 2021 decision. The decision noted the Veteran had been diagnosed with CFS in the June 2021 decision, but did not provide an adequate rationale for the denial. 

The Veteran filed another supplemental claim in August 2022. The claim was initially denied in November 2022 but re-opened upon special review under the PACT Act. 

The Veteran presented to two more VA examinations in March and April 2023 for his claim. The March 2023 VA examiner did not find the Veteran met the conditions for a diagnosis of CFS; however, did find an undiagnosed illness that is presumed to be caused by service. The April 2023 VA examiner found a diagnosis of CFS and was not required to provide a rationale as such a finding was presumed to be caused by service in Southwest Asia. 

The Board finds the Veteran has continuously pursued the claim during the pendency of the appeal. While the Veteran was denied service connection in the February 2021 Board decision, he timely filed a supplemental claim pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(3). The supplemental claim led to an October 2021 VA examination that found an undiagnosed illness was related to service. As such, the Board finds an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for CFS is warranted. 

During the period on appeal, the Veteran provided competent statements of symptoms related to CFS. See July 2021, October 2021, March 2023, and April 2023 VA examinations. Additionally, there is no affirmative evidence that the Veteran's undiagnosed illness or CFS was not related to his service in Southwest Asia or his own willful misconduct. Accordingly, having resolved all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds an earlier effective date of May 2, 2019, the date the Veteran filed his claim, is warranted for service-connected CFS.
