ORDER

An effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy is denied.

An initial compensable rating for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy is denied.

An initial compensable rating for left testicle removal is denied.

An initial compensable rating for carcinoma-basal, face right cheek, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526 seeking service connection for testicular cancer in June 2007 that was denied in a February 2008 rating decision; the Veteran did not finalize his appeal of that decision and the February 2008 decision is final. 

2. The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ seeking to reopen his claim for service connection for testicular cancer that was received in June 2012 and denied in a June 2013 rating decision; the Veteran did not appeal that decision or submit new and material evidence during the appeal period and that decision is final.

3. The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, that was received on June 7, 2023; service connection for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy was granted effective August 10, 2022.

4. There is no indication that a formal claim for service connection for left testicular cancer was filed prior to the June 7, 2023, the date on which the VA Form 21-0995 was received, or that an informal claim for service connection for left testicular cancer was filed prior to March 24, 2015.

5. The Veteran's left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy is not manifested by local reoccurrence or metastasis or residual disability in the form of either voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction.

6. The Veteran has only had his left testicle removed and there is no evidence that his remaining right testicle is nonfunctioning.

7. The Veteran's carcinoma-basal, face right cheek, is not manifested by at least one characteristic of disfigurement.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155 (2014), 3.400 (2024).

2. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528.

3. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for left testicle removal have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7524.

4. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for carcinoma-basal, face right cheek, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service from July 1989 to July 1993. His participation in combat is evident in his receipt of a Combat Action Ribbon.

The rating decision on appeal concerning the claim involving carcinoma-basal, face right cheek was issued in May 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review in June 2023, which was adjudicated in a June 2023 rating decision and not pending at the time the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was received. See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 14 (2023).  

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of a claim for left testicular cancer most recently addressed in a June 2023 rating decision. In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which granted service connection for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy and service connection for left testicle removal, assigning noncompensable ratings to both effective August 10, 2022. The AOJ also granted entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on anatomical loss of a creative organ effective August 10, 2022.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 and March 2024 AOJ decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Date Claim

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy.

The Veteran filed a claim to establish service connection for testicular cancer in June 2007. A February 2008 rating decision denied service connection for carcinoma of the left testicle and the Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement (NOD). The AOJ then issued a statement of the case (SOC) in December 2009, but the Veteran did not formalize the Legacy appeal and the February 2008 rating decision became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156 (b); 20.302, 20.1103; see also Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011); see also Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 251-52 (2010).

The Veteran filed a claim to reopen the previously denied claim in June 2012. A June 2013 rating decision treated it as an original claim and denied it on the merits, with notice sent in a June 19, 2013, letter. This rating decision became final when the Veteran did not initiate an appeal or submit new and material evidence during the appeal period. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103. 

The Veteran filed two VA Forms 526EZ that were received on May 15, 2022, and April 21, 2023, seeking service connection for testicle cancer. A May 15, 2023, letter from the AOJ informed him that this was not the correct form on which to file the claim, and the Veteran subsequently submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, that was received on June 7, 2023, seeking service connection for carcinoma of the left testicle. 

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act and the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) effective August 10, 2022, the date on which the PACT Act was enacted.

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy, broadly asserting that he is entitled to an earlier date because he originally filed his claim in 2007. See VA Form 10182.

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection is the date the claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The same is true for an award based on a claim reopened after final adjudication, as VA laws and regulations stipulate that the effective date of such an award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date the claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See id; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (r).

Prior to March 24, 2015, the VA administrative claims process recognized formal and informal claims. A formal claim was one that had been filed on the form prescribed by VA. See 38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a) (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.15 (a) (2014). An informal claim was any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under VA law. See Thomas v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 197 (2002); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.155(a) (2014). An informal claim needed to be written, see Rodriguez v. West, 189 F. 3d. 1351 (Fed. Cir. 1999), and it had to identify the benefit being sought. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-5 (1998).

For claims received on or after March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations governing how to file a claim. The effect of the amendment was to standardize the process of filing claims, and the forms accepted, to increase the efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness of claims processing, and to eliminate the concept of informal claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155; 79 Fed. Reg. 57660-01.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.114, when a benefit is awarded pursuant to a liberalizing law, the effective date shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but no earlier than the effective date of the liberalizing law. If a claim is reviewed within one year of the effective date of the liberalizing law, then the award of benefits may be authorized from the effective date of the liberalizing law. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (a)(1). However, if a claim is reviewed more than one year after the effective date of the liberalizing law, then benefits may be authorized for a period of one year prior to the date of receipt of such request. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (a)(3).

Under the law discussed above, the effective date for a grant of service connection following a final prior disallowance, which in this case occurred on two occasions, first when the Veteran did not formalize his appeal of mathe February 2008 rating decision and second when he did not appeal or submit new and material evidence within one year of notice of the June 2013 rating decision, is the date of receipt of the application to reopen, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. In this case, that would be June 7, 2023, the date on which the VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting readjudication of the previously denied claim for service connection for carcinoma of the left testicle was received. However, since the VA Form 20-0995 was received within one year of the enactment of the PACT Act on August 20, 2022, the RO correctly assigned the earliest possible effective date for its grant of service connection for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy, which based on the procedural history as outlined in detail above, was August 10, 2022. See Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2005); Sears v. Principi, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003). There is no indication that a formal claim for service connection for left testicular cancer was filed prior to the June 7, 2023, the date on which the VA Form 21-0995 was received, or that an informal claim for service connection for left testicular cancer was filed prior to March 24, 2015. 

No earlier effective date is warranted; accordingly, the claim for an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy is denied.

Increased Rating Claims 

1. An initial compensable rating for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy.

2. An initial compensable rating for left testicle removal.

Service connection for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy was granted in the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, which assigned a noncompensable (zero percent) rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528, effective August 10, 2022. The March 2024 rating decision on appeal also granted service connection for left testicle removal as secondary to the left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy and assigned a noncompensable (zero percent) rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7524, also effective August 10, 2022. 

The Veteran seeks initial compensable ratings, asserting that they are warranted because he has lost a reproductive part. See VA Form 10182. The Board notes that the Veteran has already been compensated for the loss of his left testicle in the March 2024 rating decision's grant of entitlement to SMC based on anatomical loss of a creative organ effective August 10, 2022.

Diagnostic Code 7528 provides the rating criteria for malignant neoplasms of the genitourinary system. A note provides that following the cessation of surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure, a rating of 100 percent shall continue with a mandatory VA examination at the expiration of six months. If there has been no local reoccurrence or metastasis, the note instructs to rate on residuals as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant.

Diagnostic Code 7524 provides the rating criteria for removal of the testis. If both testes are removed, a 30 percent rating is warranted. If only one testis is removed, a zero percent rating is warranted. A note indicates that an evaluation of 30 percent will be assigned for the service-connected testicular loss in cases of the removal of one testis as the result of a service-incurred injury or disease, other than an undescended or congenitally undeveloped testis, with the absence or nonfunctioning of the other testis unrelated to service. 

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7528 for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy and a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7524 for left testicle removal. The medical evidence of record dated during the relevant evidentiary window of this appeal does not include reference to treatment for either service-connected disability, leaving a June 2023 VA male reproductive organ conditions DBQ as the only medical evidence specific to the disabilities. 

During the June 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his condition had improved since onset and that he followed up with his VA doctor who originally found the testicular cancer. There is no reference to local reoccurrence or metastasis of the testicular cancer since the 2006 diagnosis and the 2007 left orchiectomy, and the VA examiner specifically indicated that there was no voiding dysfunction and no renal dysfunction. Physical examination revealed that the Veteran's right testicle was present and normal. 

Since there is no assertion or evidence to support a finding that the Veteran has exhibited local reoccurrence or metastasis of his left testicular cancer, or residual disability in the form of either voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction as a result of the left testicular cancer, the assignment of a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7528 is not warranted for the service-connected left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy. 

Similarly, since there is no assertion or evidence to support a finding that the Veteran has had both testicles removed or that his remaining right testicle is nonfunctioning, the assignment of the next highest (30 percent) rating under Diagnostic Code 7524 is not warranted for the service-connected left testicle removal.

The Board has considered whether a separate, compensable rating would be warranted for the residual scar from left orchiectomy. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994) (evaluations for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury can be combined so long as the symptomatology for one condition was not "duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology" of the other condition.) In this case, however, the Veteran does not contend, and the evidence does not show, that a separate compensable rating is warranted for the scar since it has not been described during VA examination as painful and/or unstable and the total area was not greater than 39 square cm (6 square inches). See June 2023 VA scars/disfigurement DBQ.

In sum, the weight of the evidence supports the currently assigned zero percent ratings for left testicular cancer status post orchiectomy and left testicle removal. The evidence in this case is not in approximate balance to warrant application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

3. An initial compensable rating for carcinoma-basal, face right cheek.

Service connection was granted for carcinoma-basal, face right cheek, pursuant to the PACT Act in the May 2023 rating decision on appeal, which granted an initial noncompensable (zero percent) rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7818-7800, effective August 10, 2022.

The Veteran seeks a higher initial rating based on the assertion that he has right face numbness. See VA Form 10182. Since an October 2024 rating decision has granted service connection for trigeminal neuropathy (claimed as facial neuropathy) and assigned a 10 percent rating, the Board will only consider whether an increased initial rating is warranted under the diagnostic criteria currently assigned.

Diagnostic Code 7818 provides the rating criteria for malignant skin neoplasms (other than malignant melanoma) and provides the disability is to be rated as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (Diagnostic Code 7800), scars (Diagnostic Codes 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), or impairment of function. A note provides that if there has been no local recurrence or metastasis, an evaluation will be made on residuals. 

Diagnostic Code 7800 provides the rating criteria for burn scar(s) of the head, face, or neck; scar(s) of the head, face, or neck due to other causes; or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck. 

Under Diagnostic Code 7800, one characteristic of disfigurement warrants a 10 percent rating. A scar with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with two or three characteristics of disfigurement warrants a 30 percent rating. A scar with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with four or five characteristics of disfigurement warrants a 50 percent rating. A scar with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion of three or more features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with six or more characteristics of disfigurement warrants an 80 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 7800 list the eight characteristics of disfigurement: a scar 5 or more inches in length; a scar at least one-quarter inch wide at widest part; surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation; scar adherent to underlying tissue; skin hypo- or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding six square inches; skin texture abnormal in an area exceeding six square inches; underlying soft tissue missing in an area exceeding six square inches; and, skin indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches. Id.  

Note (4) provides that disabling effects other than disfigurement that are associated with individual scar(s) of the head, face, or neck, such as pain, instability, and residuals of associated muscle or nerve injury, are to be separately rated under the appropriate diagnostic code(s). Id. As noted above, the Veteran is separately rated for trigeminal neuropathy (claimed as facial neuropathy).

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7800 for the service-connected carcinoma-basal, face right cheek, because the Veteran does not have at least one characteristic of disfigurement.  

The medical evidence of record dated during the relevant evidentiary window of this appeal does not include reference to treatment for the service-connected disability, but there are several relevant VA examinations of record.

During an August 11, 2022, VA scars/disfigurement DBQ, a scar located on the right infraocular area measuring 6.0 by 0.1 centimeters was reported, with no elevation, depression, adherence to underlying tissue, or missing underlying soft tissue. Hypopigmentation measuring approximately 0.6 centimeters squared was reported. There was no gross distortion or asymmetry of facial features or visible or palpable tissue loss; no limitation of function; and no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms. The scar was not painful or unstable with frequent loss of covering of the skin over the scar.

The Veteran underwent another VA scars/disfigurement DBQ in May 2023, at which time two scars were reported on the right cheek, one measuring 3 by 0.2 centimeters and the other measuring 3 by 0.1 centimeters. Three was no elevation, depression, adherence to underlying tissue, or missing underlying soft tissue; no abnormal pigmentation or texture; no gross distortion or asymmetry of facial features or visible or palpable tissue loss; no limitation of function; and no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms. The scars were not painful or unstable with frequent loss of covering of the skin over the scar.

A third VA scars/disfigurement DBQ was conducted a month later in June 2023. A scar located on the right lower face measuring 3.0 by 0.2 centimeters and a scar located on the right medial eye measuring 1.5 by 0.1 centimeters were reported. Hypopigmentation of both scars measuring approximately 0.75 centimeters squared was reported. There was no elevation, depression, adherence to underlying tissue, or missing underlying soft tissue; no gross distortion or asymmetry of facial features or visible or palpable tissue loss; no limitation of function; and no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms. The scars were not painful or unstable with frequent loss of covering of the skin over the scar.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars.  However, neither of the Veteran's scars are deep and non-linear and are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Although they are superficial and not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, they do not cover an area or areas of 144 square inches or greater. Moreover, the Veteran's scars are not unstable or painful. Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7801, 7802, and 7804 are inapplicable. Finally, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 as contemplated under Diagnostic Code 7805.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects. Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms and these reports are credible. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, the Veteran does not assert, and medical records do not show, that the scars on his right face are manifest by one characteristic of disfigurement.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for an initial compensable rating for the service-connected carcinoma-basal, face right cheek. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
