REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Coast Guard, including from September 1989 to September 1991, September 2001 to January 2002, and January 2003 to July 2003.

This matter is on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision.  In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, notice of disagreement, requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge.  The Board will consider evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. ยง 20.301.  

While the Board notes that this appeal arises from a rating decision issued in the past year, the Veteran's representative, in a September 2024 brief presentation, clearly indicated that the Board to review the Veteran's claim and render a decision.  The Board views this brief as a waiver of the Veteran's right to switch dockets in the remainder of the one-year period and will proceed with a decision in this case.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Regrettably, the Board finds a remand is necessary prior to the Board's final adjudication.  Specifically, the Board finds further development is warranted.

One of the effects of the AMA is to narrow the set of circumstances in which the Board must remand appeals to the AOJ for further development instead of immediately deciding them directly.  Nevertheless, even under the AMA, the Board still has the duty to remand issues when necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error.  See 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.802(a).

VA has a duty to assist a claimant in the development of a claim.  VA is obligated to provide an examination or obtain a medical opinion in a claim of service connection when the record contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability or signs and symptoms of a current disability; evidence of an in-service event, injury, or disease; that the disability or signs and symptoms of disability may be associated with active service; and the record does not contain sufficient information to decide the claim.  38 U.S.C. ยง 5103A(d); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  The threshold for finding a link between a current disability and service is low.  McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83.  The Veteran's reports of a continuity of symptomatology can satisfy the requirement for evidence that the claimed disability may be related to service.  Id.

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  See April 2020 Private Sleep Study.  The Veteran asserted that his OSA started in service and has continued since.  See April 2024 VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim.  In view of this, a VA medical opinion is necessary under McLendon to correct the pre-decisional error of not obtaining a VA medical opinion.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

The AOJ should obtain a VA medical opinion with an appropriate medical professional to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's OSA.  The examiner must review the claims file, including a copy of this remand.

The examiner must address whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's OSA is related to service.  All opinions must be supported by a rationale.
