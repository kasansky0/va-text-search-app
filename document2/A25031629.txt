ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date, for service connection, prior to March 9, 2012, for the award of a 50 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating for compensation based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) prior to December 9, 2013, is denied.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate from June 20, 2007, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  Following the issuance of a final August 2008 rating decision that denied service connection for PTSD, the Veteran did not file a formal or informal claim to reopen such previously denied claim prior to the receipt of his informal claim on March 9, 2012.

2. On December 9, 2013, VA received a VA-Form 21-8940 from the Veteran for TDIU.

3. The Veteran has not been awarded TDIU prior to December 9, 2013, and also did not have one disability rated as 100 percent disabling for this period that would otherwise raise consideration for SMC at the housebound rate; for the period between December 9, 2013, and August 22, 2016, the Veteran was unable to maintain gainful employment due to multiple service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an earlier effective date, for service connection, prior to March 9, 2012, for the award of a 50 percent rating for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) prior to December 9, 2013, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, 4.16.

3.  The criteria for entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate from June 20, 2007, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(s), 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.400, 3.2500(c).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1972 to December 1979.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2023 for earlier effective dates for the Veteran's claimed, PTSD and TDIU and in December 2022 for SMC and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

The Board notes that after a review of the Veteran's notice of disagreement and attached argument, the Veteran is not seeking an appeal based on a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) and instead is seeking an earlier effective date based on the application of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  Therefore, the Board will not be consideration this matter in the context of whether any relevant prior final decision contained CUE.  

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Direct review is the appeal option to the Board in which a Board decision is issued based on evidence of record at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a Board hearing or accept into the record additional evidence in its direct review. 

Laws and Regulations

In general, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection, shall be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

Prior to March 24, 2015, VA was required to construe any communication or action from a Veteran indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits as an informal claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(3); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.155(a).  VA is not required to anticipate any potential claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed.  Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998) (holding that before VA can adjudicate a claim for benefits, the claimant must submit a written document identifying the benefit and expressing some intent to seek it).

The effective date of an award based upon receipt of new and material evidence after a final disallowance will be the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (q)(2).  When there is a prior final decision in the claims file and a later reopened claim results in a grant of the benefit, the general rule for effective dates for reopened claims applies.  In such cases the effective date cannot be earlier than the subsequent claim to reopen. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400 (q)(2), 3.400(r); Leonard v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2004); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 246-50 (2002), aff'd, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  

New and material evidence received prior to the expiration of the appeal period, or prior to the appellate decision if a timely appeal has been filed (including evidence received prior to an appellate decision and referred to the agency of original jurisdiction by the Board without consideration in that decision in accordance with the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304(b)(1) of this chapter), will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal period.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  

Entitlement to an earlier effective date, for service connection, prior to March 9, 2012, for the award of a 50 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

The Veteran contends that his disability warrants the assignment of an earlier effective date for service connection.

The Veteran initially filed a claim for service connection for PTSD in July 2007.  Service connection for such claimed disorder was denied in an August 2008 rating decision.  Additionally, no new and material evidence was physically or constructively associated with the record within one year of the issuance of such decision and no relevant service department records have since been received.  In this regard, while updated VA treatment records and unrelated VA examination reports were subsequently associated with the record in March and May 2009, such include findings duplicative to those previously of record, or are irrelevant to the instant claim.  Therefore, the August 2008 rating decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 20.302, 20.1103 (2008).

On March 9, 2012, VA received the Veteran's application to reopen his previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  Further, the record does not show, nor does the Veteran contend, that he filed a formal or informal claim to reopen such previously denied claim after the issuance of the August 2008 rating decision and prior to March 9, 2012.

In March 2019, the Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision that awarded service connection effective from March 9, 2012.

In general, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection, shall be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

Prior to March 24, 2015, VA was required to construe any communication or action from a Veteran indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits as an informal claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(3); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.155(a).  VA is not required to anticipate any potential claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed.  Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998) (holding that before VA can adjudicate a claim for benefits, the claimant must submit a written document identifying the benefit and expressing some intent to seek it).

The effective date of an award based upon receipt of new and material evidence after a final disallowance will be the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (q)(2).  When there is a prior final decision in the claims file and a later reopened claim results in a grant of the benefit, the general rule for effective dates for reopened claims applies.  In such cases the effective date cannot be earlier than the subsequent claim to reopen.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400 (q)(2), 3.400(r); Leonard v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2004); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 246-50 (2002), aff'd, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

In sum, the Board finds that entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD is not warranted.  A review of the record shows that VA did not receive any communication from the Veteran or his representative indicating an intent to reopen the claim for service connection during the time period following the August 2008 rating decision and prior to the Veteran's informal claim that was filed on March 9, 2012.  The Board notes that the Veteran is in receipt of the earliest possible effective date for the award of service connection for this disability, which is the date that the Veteran filed to reopen this claim.  Thus, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence is against entitlement to an earlier effective date for the establishment of service connection for PTSD, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply, and the claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for this disability must be denied.

Entitlement to earlier effective date for total disability individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied.

The Veteran contends he should have been awarded an earlier effective date for TDIU.

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran identified June 20, 2007, as the date that should be established as the earlier effective date assigned.

The effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).  TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

In the present case, the Veteran's claim for TDIU was filed on December 9, 2013.  See December 9, 2013, Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.  

At a January 12, 2017, hearing, the Veteran acknowledged that he has continued employment but requested consideration for individual unemployability prior to August 22, 2016; for the period prior to his employment.

The Board's November 1, 2018, decision determined that the Veteran experienced functional limitations due to both mental and physical health problems during the pendency of his appeal and that entitlement was warranted prior to August 22, 2016.  In March 2019, the Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision that found that the Veteran was entitled to TDIU effective December 9, 2013; the date VA received the Veteran's claim for this benefit.  

The RO discontinued the award of TDIU effective August 22, 2016, as this is the date the Veteran regained employment. 

The Board finds that the evidence weighs against a finding of entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 9, 2013.  The Veteran's TDIU claim was filed on December 9, 2013.  Accordingly, an effective date earlier than December 9, 2013, for TDIU is not warranted.

In sum, the Board finds that TDIU is also not warranted effective from July 20, 2007.  Upon consideration of the record in its entirety, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation in accordance with his occupational background from December 9, 2013, to August 22, 2016.  Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that entitlement to TDIU is not warranted prior to December 9, 2013.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate from June 20, 2007, is denied.

The Veteran contends that his disability warrants the entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate from June 20, 2007.  Based on the Board's decision to deny an effective date earlier than December 9, 2013, for the award of TDIU, the Board need not consider whether the Veteran is entitled to TDIU based on one service-connected disability for entitlement to SMC prior to December 9, 2013.  The Veteran also did not have one disability rated as 100 percent disabling for this period that would otherwise raise consideration for SMC at the housebound rate.  The Board will therefore focus primarily on the period of December 9, 2013, to August 22, 2016, during which he was awarded TDIU.  

In this regard, the Board notes the Court decision in Bradley recognizes that a separate award of a TDIU predicated on a single disability may form the basis for an award of special monthly compensation (SMC).  Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).  SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) may be warranted in addition to his regular compensation if the Veteran has a total disability rating for a single disability and additional service-connected disabilities rated at 60 percent or more.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i).  The total rating for the single disability for SMC purposes may be schedular, or may be based on TDIU, so long as TDIU was granted solely because of that single disability.  Id. 

The Veteran was granted TDIU from December 9, 2013, to August 22, 2016.  

The Veteran's May 2015 VA examination indicated that the Veteran's mental health condition affected his ability to be employed.  Additionally, VA examiners found that the Veteran had functional limitations due to his lumbar spine disability, pes planus and bilateral ankle disabilities.

The Veteran's application for TDIU noted that the Veteran's inability to work was due to "all physical conditions."  Accordingly, as there is no evidence individual unemployability was granted solely due to a single disability and was granted due to multiple service-connected disabilities.

Thus, the Board finds that the requirements for entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) were not met.  In summary , the Board finds that entitlement to the award of SMC at the housebound rat

e is not warranted.  After a review of the record, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence is against entitlement to the award of special monthly compensation, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply, and the claim for entitlement to the award of special monthly compensation based on the housebound rate is not warranted and must be denied.
