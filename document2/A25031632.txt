ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) received on August 22, 2024 was not timely filed and good cause to grant an extension for the filing is not shown.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) received on August 22, 2024 is not timely, and the criteria for an extension of time for filing are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203, 20.1103.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The record demonstrates that the Veteran served on active duty with the United States (U.S.) Air Force from February 2009 to February 2013 and active duty under Title 32 with the Louisiana Air National Guard from March 2017 to July 2017.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

For the reasons set forth below, the Board finds that there is a claims processing defect and the request for an extension is denied. Thus, the claim must be dismissed. 

Dismissal

Although the Board sent a letter to the Veteran in September 2024 acknowledging receipt of a Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)), a review of the Veteran's file reveals that the Veteran's appeal related to this issue must be dismissed.

The August 2024 Notice of Disagreement was not submitted within one-year of notification of the February 2023 decision and good cause has not been demonstrated. 

Within one year from the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues a notice of a decision on a claim or issue as defined in § 3.151(c), a claimant may elect one of the following administrative review options by timely filing the appropriate form prescribed by the Secretary: (i) A request for higher-level review under § 3.2601; or (ii) An appeal to the Board (Notice of Disagreement) as outlined in 38 C.F.R. § § 20.202. At any time after VA issues notice of a decision on an issue within a claim, a claimant may file a supplemental claim under § 3.2501.

A claimant or his or her representation, must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement with a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision. The date of mailing the letter of notification of the decision will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed. An extension of the period for filing a Notice of Disagreement or a request to modify a Notice of Disagreement may be granted for good cause. A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

Notice of the February 2023 denial of service connection for sleep apnea was sent in March 2023. The Notice outlined the Veteran's appeal options and applicable timelines.

The Veteran submitted a written statement with his August 2024 Notice of Disagreement indicating that due to work life circumstances, his ability to focus on a review option for his claim in a timely manner was not feasible. He further stated that he was a single father and was unaware of the one-year deadline to request review. 

In this case, the Board does not find that the Veteran's contention rises to the level of good cause required to extend the period to file a VA Form 10182. The Veteran was notified of the timeframe that he had to submit his notice of disagreement, and the Veteran submitted his Notice of Disagreement over 17 months after the rating decision that he sought to appeal was issued. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that his life circumstances resulted in his delayed filing. These contentions, however, are too vague and unsupported for the Board to find that good cause has been presented. Compared to other examples of good cause provided in VA regulations (such as illness or hospitalization of the claimant, or the death of an immediate family member), the Veteran's description of why he was not able to file sooner does not rise to the level of good cause. See, e.g., 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.655, 20.704. Absent additional information, the Board cannot find that good cause has been presented to warrant an extension to file a Board Notice of Disagreement.

The Board finds that the one-year period in which a claimant can initiate a review of the February 2023 decision had expired prior to submission of the August 2024 Notice of Disagreement or that good cause for the delay has been established. As such, the claim must be dismissed. Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).

In sum, the issue of service connection for sleep apnea has a clear procedural defect and is noncompliant with applicable claim processing rules. No exception to the applicable claims processing rule applies. Accordingly, the appeal of the February 2023 decision for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.
