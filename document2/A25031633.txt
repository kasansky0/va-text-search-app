ORDER

Service connection for osteoarthritis of the left temporomandibular joint is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's osteoarthritis of the left temporomandibular joint had its clinical onset during his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for osteoarthritis of the left temporomandibular joint are met.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1984 to December 2005.  The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claim in a March 2023 rating decision. The Veteran subsequently requested higher level review of the March 2023 rating decision and in response, the AOJ issued a May 2024 higher level review rating decision indicating that a duty to assist error was identified and additional development would be done.  The AOJ again denied the claim in an August 2024 rating decision after a special review.

The Veteran selected the Direct Review Lane on his August 28, 2024 Notice of Disagreement (NOD).  Thus, in adjudicating the claim, the Board may consider evidence associated with the record at the time of the August 2024 rating decision.

Turning to the merits of the service connection claim, generally, service connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.  This means that the facts establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table).

Service connection may also be granted through the application of statutory presumptions for chronic conditions, such as arthritis.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101 (3), 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). Arthritis is included under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); therefore, 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) also applies.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Presumptive service connection for "chronic diseases" must be considered on three bases: chronicity during service, continuity of symptomatology since service, and manifestations within one year of the claimant's separation from service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker, 708 F.3d at 1336-38.  The application of these presumptions operates to satisfy the "in-service incurrence or aggravation" element and establish a nexus between service and a current disability, which must be found before entitlement to service connection can be granted.

Determinations as to service connection will be based on review of the entire evidence of record, to include all pertinent medical evidence.  VA must also consider all favorable lay evidence of record.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has actually observed and is within the realm of his or her personal knowledge).

Here, in addressing the criterion of a current diagnosis, the Veteran has been diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the left temporomandibular joint.  See December 2022 Temporomandibular Disorders VA Examination.

In addressing in-service incurrence, the Veteran contends that he developed a jaw condition after his wisdom teeth were removed during his active service in 1988.  The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) document wisdom teeth removal in 1988 or 1989.  The Veteran's STRs also document complaint of jaw/biting pain and diagnosis of cracked tooth syndrome in August 1994, and complaint of temporomandibular click in June 2005.

In addressing nexus, the Veteran is competent to report on his observed symptoms and on the circumstances of his injuries during and after service.  The Veteran has consistently stated that his symptoms started during his active service and continued thereafter.  The Veteran also stated that he was seen at Advance Dental Care in Valdosta, VA by Dr. W. who told him that his jaw condition could be related to the removal of the wisdom teeth due to the torquing during the procedure.  Per the Veteran, Dr. W stated that the condition is related to the meniscus in the temporomandibular joint which may possibly have damage in the joint.  The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report what his treating physicians have said to him.  See Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469.  Consistent with the Veteran's statements, VA examiners have indicated that osteoarthritis of the left temporomandibular joint can be caused by trauma or improper bite.  See March 2023 VA Addendum.  See June 2024 VA Addendum.  The AOJ also found that the evidence showed that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service.  See March 2023 Rating Decision.  See May 2024 Rating Decision.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.

Accordingly, resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran's report of jaw popping/click which started during active service and continued thereafter both competent and credible.  See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429 (1995); Elkins v. Gober, 229 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Guimond v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 69 (1993); Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995); Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another, is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

In short, the evidence of record includes lay evidence which confirms an initial onset of a jaw condition during service and a current diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the left temporomandibular joint.  As the Veteran's STRs confirm wisdom teeth removal and subsequent complaint of jaw/biting pain and temporomandibular click and credible lay statements establish a continuity of symptomatology since service, service connection for osteoarthritis of the left temporomandibular joint is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(a).

The Board acknowledges the negative VA opinions of record.  However, the Board affords these opinions little probative weight.  In rendering the negative opinion, the January 2023 VA examiner indicated no chronicity during or after service but did not address complaint of jaw/biting pain and complaint of temporomandibular click documented in the Veteran's STRs or consider the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements regarding continued jaw popping/click since service.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007). (finding a medical examination inadequate where the examiner "impermissibly ignored the appellant's lay assertions that he had sustained a back injury during service").  In rendering the negative opinions, the December 2022 and June 2024 VA examiners indicated that TMJ could be caused by trauma or improper bite, but did not address complaint of jaw/biting pain and diagnosis of cracked tooth syndrome documented in the STRs in August 1994.
