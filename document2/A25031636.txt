FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In October 2008, the Veteran had an Agent Orange examination. 

2. In February 2009, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ seeking service connection for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, a heart condition, peripheral neuropathy upper and lower extremities, a bladder condition, and depression. 

3. On May 17, 2013, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ seeking service connection for a skin condition, which was eventually granted as of the date of receipt of the claim. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 17, 2013, for the award of service connection for tinea pedis with onychomycosis (claimed as skin condition) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service with the U.S. Army from September 1968 to September 1971, to include service in Vietnam. This case comes before the Board on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) AOJ.

In August 2024, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) and selected the hearing docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  Under the hearing docket, the Board considers the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal, evidence submitted at a Board hearing, and evidence submitted by the Veteran in the 90-day period following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302. In December 2024, the Veteran testified at a Board hearing, and a transcript of such is associated with the claims file. Evidence was not submitted during the 90-day period following the hearing for submitting new evidence and is considered here.

The Board notes that a very small part of the Veteran's hearing transcript was inaudible. During his testimony, he stated the year when he first attempted to file a claim for service connection for a skin condition; however, the year he stated was inaudible. The Board notes that the Veteran was informed during the hearing that they had trouble hearing him. As discussed below, after an extensive review of the record, the record demonstrates that the Veteran had an Agent Orange examination in October 2008. The Veteran testified that he discussed with a VA doctor the skin condition he developed due to his military service. 

A claim for TDIU is part of an increased rating claim when such a claim is raised by the record. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453 (2009). Therefore, in light of the Veteran's contentions, the Board finds that the issue of TDIU is raised by the record, is part and parcel of the higher rating claim, and is properly before the Board.

Earlier effective date

Generally, the effective date of an award of compensation will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). The effective date of an award of disability compensation to a Veteran shall be the day following the date of the veteran's discharge or release if application therefor is received within one year from such date of discharge or release. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. Prior to March 24, 2015, VA recognized formal and informal claims. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014). The amendments also, inter alia, eliminated the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014), codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155 (2016). The amended regulations, however, apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Prior to that date, a "claim" was a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. "Date of receipt" of a claim, information, or evidence means the date on which a claim, information, or evidence was received by VA. Any documented communication from, or action by, a veteran indicating intent to apply for a benefit under laws administered by VA may be considered an informal claim. To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim. See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, from a Veteran or his representative, may be considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the Veteran, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. On the other hand, if the formal claim is received after one year of its receipt, then the effective date will be the date of VA's receipt of the formal application form. Jernigan v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 220, 229 (2012).

At an October 2008 Agent Orange examination, the Veteran reported that he had a skin reaction because of Agent Orange. The Veteran reported that he had lesions on his legs since leaving service. He reported that he developed or was treated for skin problems due to his exposure to herbicides. 

In February 2009, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ seeking service connection for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, a heart condition, peripheral neuropathy upper and lower extremities, a bladder condition, and depression. He did not claim a skin condition, and associated only neuropathy with his herbicide exposures.

On May 17, 2013, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ seeking service connection for a skin condition, ischemic heart disease, and prostate cancer. In a January 2015 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for a skin condition. In October 2015, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement (NOD) disagreeing with the January 2015 rating decision. In September 2018, the AOJ issued a statement of case (SOC). In September 2018, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 9 appealing his claim to the Board. In July 2022, the Board remanded the claim for further development.  In an August 2023 Decision, the Board granted service connection for a skin condition as due to herbicide exposure. In an August 2023 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the Board's August 2023 Decision. The AOJ indicated the effective date was May 17, 2013, the date they received the claim. In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA 10182 disagreeing with the effective date and rating for his skin condition. 

In December 2024, the Veteran testified that prior to 2013 he filed a claim for his skin condition. The Veteran reported that he reported he wanted to file a claim when he was at the doctor's office at a VA clinic when it was on Raines Road. He indicated that he did not file any paperwork, he just communicated with his doctor that he wanted to file a claim. When the Veteran reported the year he discussed his claim with his doctor, the year was inaudible.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran had an Agent Orange examination in October 2008. During this examination, the Veteran reported that he had skin lesions on his legs due to his herbicide exposure. As discussed above, the Veteran indicated that he told his doctor about his skin condition and indicated that he wanted to file a claim seeking service connection. However, the Veteran did not submit any paperwork to the VA seeking service connection for a skin condition prior to 2013. The Veteran indicated that he just communicated with his doctor that he wanted to file a claim. 

Unfortunately, applying the relevant law, the earliest possible date for the grant of service connection for a skin condition is the effective date assigned May 17, 2013. The Board recognizes that the Veteran discussed in October 2008 with a VA doctor concerning a claim for service connection for a skin condition; however, the Veteran did not file any formal claim or paperwork until May 2013. The Veteran failed to formalize his claim by filing a formal claim with the VA. Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the Veteran, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the intent to file a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. Here, the Veteran did not file a formal claim regarding the skin within one-year of discussing with the VA doctor in October 2008.

However, the record reflects the Veteran filed a formal claim seeking service connection for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, a heart condition, peripheral neuropathy upper and lower extremities, a bladder condition, and depression, in February 2009, which was 4 months after discussing a skin condition claim with his VA doctor in October 2008. Had the communication with the Agent Orange examiner truly been intended to initiate a claim or to put VA on notice of the intent, it would have been filed in February 2009 with the other claims. Moreover, between 2008 and 2013, there is no further indication of a skin claim; no status was requested or evidence submitted.

Because a formal claim for the skin was not received within one year, it cannot be considered to have been filed as of the date in October 2008. There is nothing in the record afterwards showing or suggesting that he filed a formal claim prior to May 17, 2013. 

As the Veteran testified before the undersigned, he did not file a formal claim for service connection for a skin condition prior to May 17, 2013. A review of the record reflects no claim for a skin condition prior to May 17, 2013, and an effective date earlier than May 17, 2013, is not warranted. The law concerning effective dates is clear that an effective date cannot be earlier than the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. The AOJ did not receive a claim of entitlement to service connection until May 17, 2013. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Remand is permitted only to correct a pre-decisional error or for any other error the correction of which raises a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Increased Rating~ Skin Condition (Tinea Pedis with Onychomycosis)

In February 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA skin condition examination. He was diagnosed with dermatophytosis (tinea corporis), xerosis cutis, and onychomycosis. The Veteran reported dry skin on his bilateral lower extremities. 

In an August 2023 Decision, the Board granted service connection for a skin condition. 

In an August 2023 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the Board's August 2023 decision. When issuing the rating decision, the AOJ only addressed tinea pedis with onychomycosis(feet). The AOJ did not address the other skin conditions on his legs and knees. 

In December 2024, he testified that his skin condition was on his legs, feet, and knees. He indicated that he scratches a lot because of his skin condition. The Veteran had to put ointment on his legs.

The Board notes a remand is warranted for the AOJ to correctly implement the Board's August 2023 decision. The AOJ should correctly address the issues and properly rate the Veteran's skin condition. 

TDIU and Earlier Effective Date SMC

The Veteran's TDIU and SMC-housebound claim is inextricably intertwined with the increased rating claim remanded herein, adjudication must be deferred pending completion of the requested development. Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Send the Veteran an application for TDIU (VA Form 21-8940 (Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability)) and an appropriate notification letter. Conduct any additional, necessary development with regard to the issue of entitlement to TDIU.

2. Take appropriate actions to properly implement the Board's August 2023 decision. The AOJ should correct the issue of a skin condition, to include knees, legs, and feet. Additionally, the AOJ should properly rate the Veteran's skin condition, to include the knees, legs, and feet.
