ORDER

Entitlement to an increased disability rating for left lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy in excess of 20 percent prior to July 18, 2022, and in excess of 40 percent thereafter, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the entire period on appeal prior to July 18, 2022, the Veteran's lower left extremity lumbar radiculopathy is manifested by no worse than moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.

2. For the entire period on appeal from July 18, 2022, the Veteran's lower left extremity lumbar radiculopathy is manifested by no worse than moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.

3. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, external popliteal nerve, posterior tibial nerve, and musculocutaneous nerve damage of the left lower extremity, rated under Diagnostic Code 8521, is at least as likely as not related to Veteran's service, to include as secondary to service-connected disability of degenerative disc disease with intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an increased disability rating for left lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy in excess of 20 percent prior to July 18, 2022, and in excess of 40 percent thereafter, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from September 1995 to September 1998. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2022; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an October 2022 rating decision. In May 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2022 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 decision.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an increased disability rating for left lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy in excess of 20 percent prior to July 18, 2022, and in excess of 40 percent thereafter.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an increased disability rating for left lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy in excess of 20 percent prior to July 18, 2022, and in excess of 40 percent thereafter.  Within a June 2024 brief, the Veteran's attorney clarified that the Veteran was seeking a 60 percent disability rating for his left lower extremity radiculopathy based on his severe symptoms and muscle atrophy associated with incomplete paralysis of the sciatic, external popliteal, and musculocutaneous nerves. Following a review of the record, and as discussed further below, the Board finds that the probative evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for the entire period on appeal. 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings. 

Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999). Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27. 

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

There are five nerve branches in the lower extremities. Each branch has its separate and distinct functions. The sciatic branch includes the sciatic nerve, external popliteal nerve (common peroneal), musculocutaneous (superficial peroneal), the anterior tibial nerve (deep peroneal), internal popliteal (tibial), and the posterior tibial nerves. The femoral branch includes the anterior crural (femoral) and the internal saphenous nerves. The obturator, external cutaneous thigh, and ilio-inguinal nerve branches only include one nerve each. For rating purposes, VA regulations preclude the assignment of separate evaluations for the same disability affecting different nerves of the same nerve branch, as such would amount to impermissible pyramiding. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

The Veteran's left lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy is currently rated as 20 percent disabling prior to July 18, 2022, and as 40 percent disabling thereafter, pursuant to DC 8520, regarding paralysis of the sciatic nerve. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 8520. Thereunder, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; a 40 percent disability rating is warranted for moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; a 60 percent disability rating is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve with marked muscular atrophy; and a maximum schedular 80 percent disability rating is warranted for complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, where the foot dangles and drops, and there is no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, and flexion of the knee is weakened or very rarely lost. Id.

Additionally, there are several other potentially applicable diagnostic codes for lower extremity radiculopathy as detailed in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. DCs 8521-8530 apply to complete or incomplete paralysis of the specific nerves: external popliteal nerve (DC 8521), musculocutaneous nerve (DC 8522), anterior tibial nerve (DC 8523), internal popliteal nerve (DC 8524), posterior tibial nerve (DC 8525), anterior crural nerve (DC 8526), internal saphenous nerve (DC 8527), obturator nerve (DC 8528), external cutaneous nerve of the thigh (DC 8529), and ilio-inguinal nerve (DC 8530).

DC 8521 provides, in relevant part, a 30 percent rating is warranted for severe, incomplete paralysis of the external popliteal nerve; and a maximum schedular 40 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis of the external popliteal nerve, manifested by symptoms of foot drop and slight drop of the first phalanges of all toes, an inability to dorsiflex the foot, loss of extension (dorsal flexion) of the proximal phalanges of the toes, loss of abduction of the foot, weakened abduction of the foot, and anesthesia covering the entire dorsum of the foot and toes.

DC 8522 provides, in relevant part, a maximum schedular 30 percent rating for complete paralysis of the musculocutaneous nerve, where eversion of the foot is weakened.  DC 8523 provides, in relevant part, a maximum schedular 30 percent rating for complete paralysis of the anterior tibial nerve, where dorsal flexion of the foot is lost.  DC 8524 provides, in relevant part, a 30 percent rating for severe incomplete paralysis of the internal popliteal nerve, and a maximum schedular 40 percent rating for complete paralysis, with plantar flexion lost, frank adduction of the foot impossible, flexion and separation of toes abolished; no muscle in sole can move; in lesions of the nerve high in popliteal fossa, plantar flexion of the foot is lost.

DC 8525 provides, in relevant part, a maximum schedular 30 percent rating for complete paralysis of the posterior tibial nerve, with paralysis of all muscles of sole of foot, frequently with painful paralysis of a causalgic nature; toes cannot be flexed; adduction is weakened; plantar flexion is impaired.

DC 8526 provides, in relevant part, a 30 percent rating for severe incomplete paralysis of the anterior crural nerve, and a maximum schedular 40 percent rating for complete paralysis, with paralysis of the quadriceps extensor muscles.

Notably, the maximum schedular rating available for DCs 8527-8530 is 10 percent; therefore, consideration of these diagnostic codes would not warrant an increased rating in the Veteran's case.  

Neither the Rating Schedule nor the regulations provide definitions for descriptive words such as "moderately severe" and "severe." Spellers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 211, 219 (2018) ("DC 8520 does not define 'mild,' 'moderate,' 'moderately severe,' or 'severe,' or generally associate those terms with specific symptoms"). Although the Board has at times attempted to define these terms using dictionary definitions, those definitions are problematic because they "do little to explain the Board's understanding of these terms and do not 'disclos[e] that benchmark it employed to reach [its] conclusion.'  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 255 (2018) (discussing the Board's attempt to define the terms slight, mild, moderate, and severe in DC 8515); see also Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain). Moreover, although 38 C.F.R. §§  4.120, 4.123, and 4.124 are "helpful in framing the analysis, [they] are not alone sufficient to explain the Board's decision absent an articulated connection to specific evidence." Lemon v. McDonough, No. 21-3949, 2022 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1998, *7 (Dec. 16, 2022) (mem dec) (Toth, J.). As explained in Lemon, these regulations leave gaps in defining the relevant terms that are filled by VA's Adjudication Manual, M21-1:

The Board "is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases." Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257 (2018). Clearly relevant to this case are M21-1 provisions regarding evaluations of paralysis of the sciatic nerve. The M21-1 provides that a moderately severe evaluation (that is, a 40 percent rating) is available when there is "[m]otor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a higher level of limitation or disability." Id. Atrophy may, but need not, be present for a moderately severe rating.

As concluded by the Court in Lemon, given the relevance of these provisions to rating disabilities of the peripheral nerves, "the Board's failure to mention the M21-1's relevant guidance in this area constitutes clear error." Lemon, at *7-*8. See also Bethea, 2 Vet. App. at 254. The Board will therefore mention, and apply, these definitions in the instant case. See also Boothe v. McDonough, No. 21-4488, 2023 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 121, *2 (Jan. 27, 2023) (Nonprecedential Panel Order) (granting a Joint Motion for Remand in which the parties "agree[d] that the Board erred when it refused to consider relevant portions of the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual").

In discussing severe, incomplete paralysis, VA's Adjudication Manual, V.iii.12.A.2.c., indicates, "In general, expect motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy cases." The Manual also indicates, "For the sciatic nerve (38 CFR § 4.124a, DC 8520) marked muscular atrophy is expected." Moreover, according to the Manual, "[e]ven though severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs/symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve." Finally in this regard, the Manual states, "Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve (38 CFR § 4.123)."

The Board is not bound by the provisions of the M-21 manual. See generally DAV v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 859 F.3d 1072, 1077 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Nonetheless, the Court has found that even where an agency's rules lack the force of law, it still may be compelled to follow them. Healey v. McDonough, 33 Vet. App. 312 (2021) (citing Hundick v. Wilkie, 755 F.App'x 998 (Fed. Cir. 2018)). To this end, the Court has recently emphasized that the M-21 manual constitutes a "relevant factor and that the Board cannot ignore the M-21 manual in its analysis. Healey, 33 Vet. App. at 320 (2021).

Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, it is not dispositive of an issue. Instead, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding any request for an increased rating. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

When addressing peripheral nerve injuries, the term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type pictured for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most moderate degree. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The relevant temporal focus for adjudicating the level of disability of an increased rating claim begins one year before the claim was filed. VA received the Veteran's formal claim for an increased rating for lumbar radiculopathy, left lower extremity on July 18, 2022. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b), if VA receives a complete application form appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. Accordingly, the Board finds that the instant claim for an increased rating was received in July 2022, the period for consideration will include evidence one year prior to the receipt of claim, from July 18, 2021.

Turning to the relevant evidence of record during the period on appeal from July 18, 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA peripheral nerves examination in July 2021.  At that time, the Veteran reported that his nerve issues in his bilateral lower extremities are directly related to his slip and fall while in the military when carrying a heavy object.  He reported ongoing pain that worsened to the extent of getting a repeat MRI in January of 2021 which demonstrated a slipped disc with compression of the sciatic nerve root requiring physical therapy two times per week related to his recent discectomy in April 2021.  Upon physical examination, the VA examiner documented moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and mild numbness in the left lower extremity.  The Veteran displayed muscle strength with active movement against some resistance (rated as 4/5) in left ankle dorsiflexion, ankle plantar flexion, and knee extension, without muscle atrophy.  Reflexes were normal in the left lower extremity, and sensation was decreased throughout the left lower extremity.  There were no trophic changes noted.  The Veteran displayed an abnormal gait and used a walker for ambulation due to pain and weakness from discectomy and prior lumbar pain causing immobility.  The VA examiner identified the affected nerve as moderate incomplete paralysis of the left sciatic nerve, with no other affected nerves identified, and no other pertinent findings.

Subsequently, the Veteran was also afforded another VA peripheral nerves examination in August 2022.  At that time, he reported that after surgery, his feet felt like they were in a vice; he said the left side felt heavy with no sensation from the inside of his left foot and top of foot to shins with onset from June 2022.  He also noted pain when sitting for long periods of time and an inability to walk without a walker or to lift on anything over ten pounds.  The examiner noted a diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy of the left lower extremity as of July 2022 with symptoms of peripheral nerve conditions in the lower left extremity including severe constant pain, severe paresthesias, and severe numbness.  Upon physical examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran had abnormal gait due to his lumbar radiculopathy resulting in a walker to get around due to muscle weakness with numbness and tingling.  Muscle strength testing was diminished to active movement against gravity (rated as 3/5) throughout the left lower extremity, with noted muscle atrophy measured at the left thigh as 40 cm on the normal side and 39 cm on the atrophied (left) side, or a difference of 1 cm.  Sensation was absent throughout the left lower extremity, and there were also tropic changes as the Veteran had smooth, hairless calves.  When asked to identify the specific nerves affected by the Veteran's peripheral nerve condition and the resulting severity, the VA examiner noted that there was moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic, external popliteal, musculocutaneous, and posterior tibial nerves.  The Veteran continued to require constant use of a walker due to his lower extremity radiculopathy, with no other pertinent physical findings.  

The Board has also considered any additional VA and private treatment records, although such records do not document specific findings as to the severity of the Veteran's left lower extremity peripheral nerves, and as such, they are less probative than the two VA peripheral nerves examinations conducted during the appeal period and discussed in detail above.  

After consideration of the July 2021 and August 2022 VA examinations, the Board finds that the examinations are probative objective medical evidence which weighs against the Veterans' claim of entitlement to an increased disability rating for left lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy in excess of 20 percent prior to July 18, 2022, and in excess of 40 percent thereafter.

Notably, the July 2021 VA peripheral nerves examination documented no worse than moderate, incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, which is consistent with the Veteran's 20 percent rating for the sciatic nerve prior to July 18, 2022.  The Board notes that the August 2022 VA peripheral nerves examination also noted no worse than moderate incomplete paralysis for any affected nerve, including the sciatic nerve, which requires moderately severe incomplete paralysis for a 40 percent disability rating.

To the extent that the VA examiner also identified moderate incomplete paralysis of three other nerves, including the external popliteal, musculocutaneous, and posterior tibial nerves, the Board again notes that separate ratings are not warranted for such impairment, as each of these nerves is part of the sciatic nerve branch of the lower extremity, and to award separate compensable ratings for the separate nerves affected would constitute impermissible pyramiding.  The staged ratings which have already been awarded for left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve under DC 8520 contemplates moderate and moderately severe incomplete paralysis, respectively, and the Veteran's reported and observed left lower extremity neurological symptoms during the staged rating periods are contemplated by the assigned staged ratings the appropriate diagnostic code. Separate and/or higher compensable ratings left lower extremity radiculopathy of any other lower extremity nerve that are also part of the sciatic nerve branch would affect the same general functions of the left lower extremity. Therefore, no separate and/or higher ratings are warranted for radiculopathy of the external popliteal, musculocutaneous, and posterior tibial nerves for any period on appeal.

The Board is mindful that the Veteran reported several peripheral nerve symptoms rated as severe during the August 2022 VA examination, and it appears reasonable that the AOJ weighed these reported severe symptoms with the objective finding of moderate incomplete paralysis identified by the VA examiner as more nearly approximating moderately severe incomplete paralysis in order to award the Veteran's staged increased 40 percent rating, effective July 18, 2022.  However, to the extent that the Veteran asserts that an increased 60 percent disability rating is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscle atrophy for any period on appeal, the Board notes that no muscle atrophy was noted upon VA examination in July 2021.  To the extent that the August 2022 VA examiner noted muscle atrophy of a 1 cm difference in measurement of the left thigh when compared to the normal side, the Board finds that is it reasonable to find that this results in no more than slight muscle atrophy which does not equate to a finding of "marked" muscle atrophy sufficient to warrant a 60 percent rating under DC 8520 for any period on appeal.

As such, the most probative evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy was manifested by moderately severe incomplete paralysis or its functional equivalent to warrant an increased rating in excess of 20 percent prior to July 18, 2022, or severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscle atrophy or its functional equivalent to warrant an increased rating in excess of 40 percent from July 18, 2022.  Rather, the Board thus finds that the Veteran's resulting level of functional impairment of his left lower extremity is most analogous to the Veteran's staged 20 percent rating prior to July 18, 2022 and 40 percent rating thereafter.

In so finding the above, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay assertions that his left lower extremity radiculopathy is more severe than contemplated by the current staged ratings assigned.  The Veteran is competent to report symptoms such as pain because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). However, he is not considered competent to medically attribute or assess the severity of his left lower extremity radiculopathy as required in the Diagnostic Code, as this requires medical training and/or expertise to opine on a complex, internal neurological condition beyond the external observance of a layperson. See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007). Therefore, his statements do not constitute competent evidence and, the Board assigns more probative weight to the competent medical evidence of record discussed above.

For the above reasons, the Board finds that the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so regarding whether an increased disability rating for left lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy in excess of 20 percent prior to July 18, 2022, and in excess of 40 percent thereafter, is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's increased rating claim for the entire period on appeal. The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), is therefore not for application, and the claim is denied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
