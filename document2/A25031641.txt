REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the United States Naval Reserve with an initial period of active duty for training (ADT) from December 1983 to August 1984 and with additional Reserve service from August 1983 to 1989 and from May 1997 to December 2005. 

The Veteran is service-connected for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which confers veteran status only for this period of training from October 25, 2003 to October 29, 2003. See Deferred Rating (e.g. VA Form 21-6789) (January 2020) (establishing active service in the Navy from October 25, 2003 to October 29, 2003, based on the grant of service connection for PTSD); See Hill v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 243 (2016) (service connection establishes "veteran status," but only for the period of ADT or inactive duty training (IDT) during which the service-connected disability was incurred).  The Veteran is service-connected for bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and hypertension; however, the period of training during which the disabilities incurred are unknown. See Rating Decision-Narrative (April 2017). 

VA has conceded the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) due to his military occupational specialty (MOS) as an aviation technician. See Other (June 2023) (conceding exposure to jet fuels, etc., while performing his duties in the Naval Reserve); see also 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (38); 1119; 1710(e)(1)(G) (defining "Toxic exposed Veteran" to include those who participated in a TERA while serving on ADT or IDT). VA Memo, dated December 2022, has identified deployments to Iraq in 2005..

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

In remanding these matters, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions. Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his prostate cancer disability is related to exposures jet exhaust and fuel associated with his MOS as an aviation technician. See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) (February 2023). 

The October 2023 rating decision reflects favorable findings that the Veteran (1) has been diagnosed with a disability, the Veteran has been diagnosed with prostate cancer; and (2) participation in a TERA is conceded based on the Veteran's MOS as an Aviation Technician resulting in exposure to jet fuels while in service. See Rating Decision-Narrative (October 2023). The Board is bound by these favorable findings.

By way of history, the Veteran enlisted in the Naval Reserve in August 1983. See Military Personnel Record at 13 (December 2019). An enlisted performance record note, dated December 20, 1983, reflects the Veteran was ordered to Active Duty. See Id. at 16. DD214 reflects the Veteran served a period of ADT between December 1983 to August 1984. See Id. at 11. The Veteran discharged from the Naval Reserve in August 1989. See Id. at 9. The Veteran re-enlisted in the Naval Reserve in May 1997. See Military Personnel Record at 6 (December 2019).  The record reflects a first extension to enlistment in April 2003 for a 24-month period and a second extension in April 2005 for an eight-month period. See Id. at 11 and 12. The Veteran was discharged in December 2005. See Id. at 14.  

When a claim for service connection is based only on a period of ADT or IDT, there must be evidence that the claimant became disabled as a result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during that period of ADT or IDT. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(2), (22), (24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a); Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167, 172 (2010); Acciola v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 320, 324 (2008) (citing Mercado-Martinez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 415, 419 (1998); Paulson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 466, 470 (1995)). In the absence of such evidence, the period of ADT or IDT would not qualify as "active military, naval, air, or space service," and the claimant would not qualify as a "veteran" for that period of ADT or IDT service alone. 38 U.S.C. § 101(2), (24); see Acciola, 22 Vet. App. at 324. 

The issue of entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the October 2023 decision on appeal. 

VA's duty to assist includes making as many requests as are necessary to obtain relevant records from a Federal department or agency, such as military records, including service treatment records and service personnel records. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2). 

First, the AOJ had a duty to verify the Veteran's dates of ADT and IDT that correspond to is service-connected disabilities as this impacts the relevant law for consideration in addressing the Veteran's claim of  entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer, as noted above. 

The record shows that, prior to the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran had established service-connected for PTSD, bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and hypertension. See Rating Decision-Codesheet (October 2023). However, the while the record reflects a verified period of ADT that corresponds with the grant of service connection for PTSD, record does not contain verified periods of ADT or IDT that correspond to awards of service connection for bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and hypertension. See Deferred Rating Decision (January 2020) (stating "Service in the Navy from 10/25/2003 to 10/29/2003, is now considered active service based on the grant of SC for PTSD").   Specifically, the record contains confirmation of periods of active duty between December 1983 and August 1984, but there is no AOJ memorandum of record specific to the December 1983 to August 1984 that establishes the Veteran's active service status. See Military Personnel Record (April 2023). Further, the record reflects the Veteran earned 0 active points between August 1983 to August 1989. See Military Personnel Record at 84 (June 2023). The record contains ADT and IDT periods between August 1983 to August 1989, May 1997 to February 2005, and February 2005 to September 2005. See Id. at 88, 91. Further, VADIR records do not contain any active duty service periods. See Service Record (SR) (September 2023). 

Second, the AOJ had a duty to verify the Veteran's foreign service and deployments, to include dates and location of each deployment. 

The record reflects the Veteran received the Kosovo Campaign Medal with dates of award from April 1999 to June 1999. See Military Personnel Record at 94 (June 2023). The record also reflects the Veteran earned the Bosnia Medal award. See DPRIS Response at 53 (February 2017). 

A Memo, dated January 2023, reflects qualifying deployment to Iraq from July 15, 2005, to July 17, 2005, and from August 6, 2005, to August 17, 2005. See VA Memo (January 2023). However, service personnel records (SPRs) and STRs do not contain reference to deployment in Iraq.

Further, SRs reflect deployment as a Reserve member for four periods: July 1, 2001 to July 31, 2001; January 1, 2002 to August 31, 2004; July 15, 2005 to July 17, 2005; and August 6, 2005 to August 17, 2005. However, the record does not contain deployment locations. See Service Record (SR) (September 2003). 

The nature and location of his overseas deployments is relevant to this appeal for the purpose determining and identifying any and all of the Veteran's TERAs to include environmental hazards and toxins within the SWA theater of operations. 

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist errors on the part of the AOJ in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the October 2023 rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Verify the period or periods of ADT or IDT that correspond to awards of service connection for bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and hypertension as this would confer veteran status for those periods.

2. Verify the Veteran's duty status as well as the dates and locations of the Veteran's foreign service for the following periods of time: 

(a.) July 1, 2001 to July 31, 2001

(b.) January 1, 2002 to August 31, 2004, 

(c.) July 15, 2005 to July 17, 2005, 

(d.) August 6, 2005 to August 17, 2005.
