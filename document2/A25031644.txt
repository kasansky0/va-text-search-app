ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (sleep apnea) is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder of the face to include razor bumps is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's current sleep apnea had its onset in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1999 to December 2011, to include service in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The Veteran received the Combat Action Badge among other medals and awards.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2024 rating decision and a February 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  In the April 2024 decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's original claim for service connection for razor bumps and in the February 2024 rating decision, on Higher Level Review, the AOJ confirmed and continued the previous denial of service connection for sleep apnea. Previously, an August 2023 rating decision was issued by the AOJ that identified a duty to assist error following the Veteran's April 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review. Prior to the Veteran's April 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review, the AOJ issued an April 2023 rating decision that denied service connection for sleep apnea.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. In the May 2024 VA Form 10182 the Veteran appealed his claims for service connection of razor bumps and sleep apnea.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 and April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of skin condition of the face to include razor bumps any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner and therefore will not delay issuance of the decision to the extent that there is any remaining time to switch dockets under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is granted.

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service disease or injury; and (3) a relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The April 2023 VA examination report contains a diagnosis of sleep apnea. The current disability requirement has thus been met.

As to the in-service injury or disease element, service treatment records (STRs) are negative for complaints, treatment, or findings of sleep apnea. However, in the April 2023 DBQ, the Veteran reported his sleep apnea began during service. Further, he reported in his September 2021 VA 21-526EZ that since his first deployment to Iraq he has not had a good night of sleep, he was tested for sleep apnea and was given a diagnosis.  Given the observable nature of symptoms, the lay statements regarding the in-service onset of symptoms are competent. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay witnesses are competent to report factually observable symptoms). The Board also finds these statements credible. Thus, the in-service injury or disease requirement is met.

The remaining issue is thus whether there is a relationship between the current sleep apnea and the in-service sleep symptoms.  

As noted above, the Veteran, in September 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ reported he began having trouble with sleep during his deployment to Iraq. These symptoms continued to the present and he was diagnosed with sleep apnea. 

In a March 2023 VA Opinion, the clinician opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's sleep apnea was related to toxic exposure risk activities. The clinician reported there is no known causal relationship between sleep apnea and toxic exposure while in service. The clinician opined after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran's and the synergistic combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran, it was less likely than not that the Veteran's sleep apnea was related to in service toxic exposure.

During the April 2023 DBQ the Veteran reported that he began experiencing trouble with sleep apnea in the 2010s with symptoms to include daytime drowsiness, fatigue, and apneic breathing. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336, n. 1 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (noting that VA's examiner's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the veteran's] disability such that his claim for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence").

In this regard, service connection does not require that a current disability be related to a particular exposure or any other causal agent in service, it only requires that a current disability had its onset in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) ("service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces"); Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) ("Congress has designed and fully intends to maintain a beneficial non-adversarial system of Veterans benefits. This is particularly true of service-connected disability compensation where the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"). See also Dallas v. McDonough, No. 20-1215, 2021 U.S. App. Claims LEXIS 235, *4 (Feb. 18, 2021) (mem dec.) (Falvey, J.) (noting that the question for the Board in a direct service connection case is, "not whether military service caused the Veteran's disability but 'whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service'"); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).

While the Board could remand the case for another opinion, such a request could be construed as obtaining additional evidence for the sole purpose of denying a claim, which is impermissible. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c) ("The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination"); Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021) ("Remand is inappropriate where the predominant purpose is not to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision unencumbered by error but to allow VA to obtain more evidence so that it can properly deny the claim"). The evidence is sufficient to decide the claim as the symptoms reported by the Veteran during service were the same ones that were the basis for the post service diagnosis, reflecting that the sleep symptoms were early manifestations of the subsequently diagnosed sleep apnea. Given, the credible lay statements by the Veteran indicating that his sleep apnea had its onset in service, entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is warranted. Maples v. Wilkie, No. 18-2016, 2019 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 199 (Feb. 11, 2019) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.) (lay evidence can be sufficient to support a claim for service connection for sleep apnea); Bethea, 2 Vet. at 254 (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea had its onset in service. As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in the Veteran's favor, entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service connection for a skin disorder of the face to include razor bumps is remanded.

In his December 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran sought service connection for razor bumps. There, he reported that during service he had a shaving profile during service.

In his August 2022 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for razor bumps. However, the AOJ did not provide the Veteran with an examination to determine whether he had a diagnosis for any skin condition of the face to include razor bumps or whether the Veteran's claimed razor bumps were related to service. 

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). For the following reasons, a remand is warranted based on a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

Under 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103A(d), VA must provide an examination or opinion with regard to claims for disability compensation when there is competent evidence of a disability (or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability) that may be associated with an in-service event, injury, or disease, but there is insufficient information to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103A(d); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006). The Veteran's reports of a continuity of symptomatology can satisfy the requirement for evidence that the claimed disability may be related to service, and the threshold for finding that the disability (or symptoms of a disability) may be associated with service is low. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83; Locklear v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 410, 419 (2006).

Here, the Veteran reported that his razor bumps began in service as a result of shaving during basic training, and he was given a profile during basic training. The Veteran's competent lay evidence of a skin condition of the face, to include razor bumps while in service that continued to the present persistent or recurrent symptoms meets the low threshold required to provide him with an examination to determine whether service connection is warranted. However, there is no evidence during the evidence window reflecting that the Veteran has been afforded a VA examination or medical opinion as to the nature and etiology of his skin condition of the face. Given the persistent and recurrent symptoms a skin condition of the face that may be associated with service, a remand for an examination or opinion is warranted.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the record any outstanding service personnel records, to include any profiles.

2. After all efforts have been exhausted to obtain and associate with the claims file any additional records, schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the nature of any current skin disability of the face to include razor bumps and whether any such disability is related to or had its onset in service.

The examiner must opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any skin disability of the face experienced by the Veteran (1) began during active service; (2) is related to an in-service injury or disease, including the Veteran's reported skin symptoms in service and participation in toxic exposure risk activity or activities.

If there is no current diagnosis with regard to a skin disorder of the face, it should also be considered whether any skin symptoms are due to an undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness.

The clinician is advised that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms, treatment, and injuries; and that his reports must be taken into account in formulating the requested opinions.  A complete rationale should be provided for any opinion given.
