REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable disability evaluation for hypertension is remanded.

Entitlement to a total disability evaluation due to individual unemployability (TDIU) prior to March 15, 2023 is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1975 to September 1978.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 and February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to a compensable disability evaluation for hypertension is remanded.

2. Entitlement to a TDIU prior to March 15, 2023 is remanded.

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. §5103A, if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. §5103A?(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. §20.802?(a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. §20.802?(a).

The Veteran has credibly and consistently reported symptoms associated with his hypertension that were not addressed by the VA examiner with whom he met in July 2023, most notably significant edema in the lower extremities resulting in postural and exertional limitations impacting employability. For instance, a March 2023 submission reports the Veteran was "retaining so much water in [his] legs that [he] could hardly walk." 

On remand, the Veteran should be afforded a new VA examination and expert medical assessment that addresses the full range of complaints associated with the Veteran's service-connected hypertension.

Regarding TDIU, because the disposition of that claim depends in some measure on the claim for increase, the two claims are inextricably intertwined, and the TDIU claim must be remanded as well.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with a qualified clinician to explore the current nature and severity of his service-connected hypertension. The examiner should review the entire claims file, including a copy of this remand, prior to the examination.

The examiner is directed to relate all current symptomatology associated with hypertension in accordance with VA rating criteria, and to address the full range of reported symptomatology, to include lower extremity edema, and its impact on the Veteran's occupational capacity.
