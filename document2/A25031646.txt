FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, left knee tendinitis with tibiofibular joint ganglion cyst is at least as likely as not related to service.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder, is at least as likely as not related to service.

3. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran has experienced continuity of symptomatology related to tinnitus since separation from service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for left knee tendinitis with tibiofibular joint ganglion cyst (claimed as a left knee condition) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran, who is the appellant, had active service from June 2016 to May 2017, with additional periods of ACDUTRA and INACDUTRA prior to his period of active service.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for bilateral hearing loss, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the claims file. Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, all the evidence submitted. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the Board must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence). The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claims. The appellant must not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran). The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence that it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive. Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence in the record; not every item of evidence has the same probative value.  

The Court has held that an appellant need only demonstrate that there is an "approximate balance of positive and negative evidence" in order to prevail. See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is not in equipoise, but nevertheless is in approximate balance.  An approximate balance of the evidence includes, but is not limited to equipoise. Evidence is not in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. When there is an approximate balance in the evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Service Connection, Generally

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999), citing Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

VA has established certain rules and presumptions for chronic diseases, such as tinnitus. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013). With chronic diseases shown as such in service so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless attributable to intercurrent causes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). In addition, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, chronic diseases are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of symptoms. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "[w]hether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue to be addressed by the Board").

The Board is charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence. Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997. In Jefferson v. Principi, 271 F.3d 1072 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), citing its decision in Madden, recognized that the Board has an inherent fact-finding ability. Id. at 1076. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to weigh and assess the evidence. Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 488-89 (2000).

As a finder of fact, when considering whether lay evidence is satisfactory, the Board may also properly consider internal inconsistency of the statements, facial plausibility, consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the Veteran, and the Veteran's demeanor when testifying at a hearing. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 38 (2007).

1. Service connection for left knee tendinitis with tibiofibular joint ganglion cyst (claimed as a left knee condition).

The Veteran contends that his left knee disability, diagnosed as left knee tendinitis with tibiofibular joint ganglion cyst, is related to service.  The Veteran reported that he injured his knee during physical training exercises and has had issues with the knee since service.

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that is related to service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of left knee tendinitis with tibiofibular joint ganglion cyst as evidenced by the December 2023 VA examination. 

During service, the Veteran complained of and was treated for left knee pain symptoms in 2011 during bootcamp. He was also seen for knee pain in August 2013, March 2017, and May 2017. The March 2017 record noted complaints of recurrent pain in the left knee reactivated while on outside the wire patrol. The Veteran also reported recurrent knee pain on the May 2017 report of medical history completed in conjunction with his separation from service. The May 2017 report of medical examination also noted left knee injury from boot camp in 2011 and indicated he continued to have intermittent discomfort with increased physical activity. Thus, the question becomes whether the current disability is related to service. On this question there is a probative opinion in favor of the claim.

The evidence in favor of the claim includes a December 2023 VA examination and medical opinion. The VA examiner's opinion and rationale was that given the multiple recorded instances of left knee pain throughout his periods of ADT and active service as well as his continued intermittent left knee discomfort with increased activities, it is at least as likely as not the Veteran's current left knee disability is related to service. This medical opinion is probative because it contains clear conclusions with supporting data, and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current left knee disability is related to service. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for a left knee disability is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.

The Veteran asserts that he has an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as PTSD, that is related to service. 

The evidence of record suggests that the Veteran has been diagnosed with other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder. See December 2023 VA examination. Therefore, the Board will broadly construe the issue as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder and PTSD. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2009) (holding that the Board must consider any disability that "may reasonably be encompassed by" the description of the claim and symptoms and other submitted information).

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that is related to service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

The December 2023 VA examination shows the Veteran has a current diagnosis of other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder. Thus, the question becomes whether the current disability is related to service. On this question there is probative opinion in favor of the claim.

The evidence in favor of the claim includes a December 2023 VA examination and medical opinion. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder is at least as likely as not related to service. The rationale was that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms onset after an incident during service and have continued since separation.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder is related to service. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

3. Service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran contends that he has tinnitus related to hazardous noise exposure he incurred during service.  

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus as evidenced by his July 2023 statement. Tinnitus is an "other organic disease of the nervous system," which is an enumerated condition under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Walker, 708 F.3d 1331.

While no treatment records exist from during the applicable presumptive period, the Board finds that the Veteran continued to experience the same symptoms from May 2017 to the present. The Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of "low-pitched ringing in both ears" during that period, but did not seek treatment. The Veteran's statements are credible and entitled to probative weight, as they are internally consistent and consistent with other evidence of record, which shows that these symptoms were attributable to the Veteran's tinnitus. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) obtained a December 2023 medical opinion prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.  However, this medical opinion does not provide an adequate rationale regarding whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

The Board notes that VA attention has been directed to a sponsored 2006 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on delayed onset hearing loss. The December 2023 VA audiology examiner's opinion stated, "Per the 2006 Institute of Medicine report, 'There is not sufficient evidence from longitudinal studies in laboratory animals or humans to determine whether permanent noise-induced hearing loss can develop much later in one's lifetime, long after the cessation of that noise exposure.'" The VA examiner continued citing to the IOM report, "Although the definitive studies to address this issue have not been performed, based on the anatomical and physiological data available on the recovery process following noise exposure, it is unlikely that such delayed effects occur." 

In Lemmons, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) found that, while the report states that "based on the anatomical and physiological data available on the recovery process following noise exposure, it is unlikely" that the onset of hearing loss begins years after noise exposure occurs (IOM report at 47), this statement does not reflect the full extent of the report's findings pertinent to the matter. The Court provided that, while a portion of the IOM report found there is no evidence of delayed onset hearing loss due to noise exposure, another portion of the same IOM report found that "an individual's awareness of the effects of noise on hearing may be delayed considerably after the noise exposure." (IOM report at 203-04). The Court has directed attention to the fact that the IOM report's language may support a theory of service connection involving delayed onset of a veteran's perception of hearing loss such that a VA examiner's citation of the report should contemplate all of the pertinent aspects of its findings. See, e.g., Lemmons v. McDonald, No. 15-3043, 2016 LEXIS 1646 (Vet. App. October 28, 2016) (non-precedential). Accordingly, the December 2023 VA examiner's opinion is inadequate. D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97 (2008); McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243 (2019).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA audiology examination, with an examiner who has not previously examined the Veteran, to diagnose and obtain an opinion regarding the etiology of any right or left ear hearing loss disability. 

The examiner must review the claims file, to include this Remand, in its entirety; the Veteran's lay statements concerning in-service noise exposure and hearing loss symptoms during and since service; the previous VA examination; and the 2006 IOM report concerning an individual's delayed awareness on the effects on hearing from noise, and the onset of current symptomatology, and should indicate review of the file in the examination report. 

The examiner must opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not that any portion of the Veteran's hearing loss is etiologically related to active service or any event, disease, or injury during service, including whether any hearing disability (1) began during active service, (2) was noted during service with continuity of the same symptomatology since service, (3) was caused by the service-connected disabilities or treatment for the service connected disabilities, to specifically include tinnitus, or (4) has been aggravated by the service-connected disabilities or treatment for the service-connected disabilities, to specifically include tinnitus. 

(Continued on the next page)

?

The examiner is advised that VA has conceded in-service noise exposure. The examiner is further advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms during and since service and that those reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion. If the Veteran's reports are discounted, the examiner should provide a reason for doing so. The examiner must consider and discuss those lay statements and should reconcile the opinion with any previous opinions of record. A clearly stated rationale for any opinion offered should be provided and must not be based on the lack of any in-service records of hearing loss.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
