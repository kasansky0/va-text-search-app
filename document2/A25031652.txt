ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for voiding dysfunction with recurrent urinary tract infections associated with Peyronie's disease with erectile dysfunction, status post trauma is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date for the grant of service connection for left leg length discrepancy (LLD) is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a higher initial rating for voiding dysfunction with recurrent urinary tract infections associated with Peyronie's disease with erectile dysfunction, status post trauma is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The August 2016 Board decision which denied service connection for recurrent urinary tract infections to include as secondary to Peyronie's disease is final. 

2. The Veteran submitted a claim to reopen the previous denial for Peyronie's disease, received by VA on October 31, 2017, which was denied in a December 2017 rating decision; no new and material evidence was submitted within one year of that decision and it is final.

3. The Veteran submitted a received by VA on November 1, 2018.

4. The first communication from the Veteran to VA evidencing a claim for service connection for left leg length discrepancy (LLD) was received on January 24, 2012.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than November 1, 2018, for the grant of service connection for voiding dysfunction with recurrent urinary tract infections has not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114 (a)(3), 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than January 24, 2012, for the grant of service connection for left leg length discrepancy (LLD) are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1981 to October 1984, and from May 1987 to July 1990. The Veteran also had a period of service from November 1990 to September 1992 that has been characterized by the service department as "other than honorable".

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a November 2022 rating decision. A duty to assist error was identified and the Veteran's claim was then processed in the Supplemental Lane. In March 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the rating decision on appeal based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. 

In the timely filed April 2023, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) March 2023 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period when new evidence was not allowed. As the Board is deciding the above captioned earlier effective date claims, it may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to an increased rating for the Veteran's service - connected voiding dysfunction for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of those claims.

The Board notes that the issue of a total disability rating (TDIU) is considered part and parcel of an increased rating claim on appeal if the issue of employability is raised by the record. Here, the Board notes that the issue of TDIU was adjudicated in a March 2020 rating decision. The Veteran's employment records indicated that he was gainfully employed until on or about October 27, 2018 and TDIU was granted effective October 27, 2018. As the issue of TDIU has been previously adjudicated and granted as of the date the Veteran stopped working, the Board finds that the issue of TDIU is not before the Board. 

The Board notes that the AOJ requested the Veteran submit any relevant private treatment records or submit information with which VA can assist the Veteran in obtaining private treatment records. Required notice and information were provided in the claim form which the Veteran signed, certifying to the fact that such notice was received and further than they have included or identified relevant evidence. VA requested records for which the Veteran submitted a proper release and/or adequately identified. The duty to assist is not a one-way street. If the Veteran desires help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining evidence. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991). Thus, the Board finds that VA has satisfied the duty to assist. No further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in development. Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).

38 C.F.R. § 3.103 provides that a Veteran, upon request, is entitled to a hearing prior to VA's adjudication of an initial or supplemental claim.  The Board observes that notice regarding the opportunity for a hearing at the AOJ was not provided in this case. In Bowen, the Court found that there was no due process violation in the denial of the Veteran's requested hearing before the AOJ because the Veteran had subsequently been offered the opportunity to have a hearing before the Board. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253 (2012). Here, the Veteran was offered a choice of three dockets in the AMA framework to include the Board hearing docket. Although the issue in Bowen was not one of notice, the Board cannot discern a basis to find that the underlying holding and logic of Bowen would not lead to the same finding of a lack of prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.

The standard set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) only permits constructive receipt of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records that not only existed prior to the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal, but also for which the claimant furnished sufficient information to make the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) aware of the existence of those records. Thus, the Board's consideration of VHA records is limited to the same. Here, the Board finds that VA treatment records were obtained and reviewed consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) and the AMA framework.

Effective Dates

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A "claim" is defined in the VA regulations as "a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p). VA must look to all communications from a claimant that may be interpreted as applications or claims - formal and informal - for benefits and is required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits. Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198 (1992).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments also, inter alia, eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014), codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.157. The amended regulations, however, apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015. Prior to the March 24, 2015, amendment, VA accepted both formal and informal claims.

Where a claim has been finally adjudicated and then reopened later, the effective date of any subsequent award is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (q)(2). If there is a prior final VA denial of the benefit sought, the effective date cannot be earlier than a subsequent claim to reopen. Leonard v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 447 (2004); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 246-50 (2002).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 1, 2018, for the grant of service connection for voiding dysfunction with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) associated with Peyronie's disease with erectile dysfunction, status post trauma is denied.

In his April 2023 VA Form 10182 NOD the Veteran generally contends that the effective onset for his voiding dysfunction should be August 2000. He seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection. 

Factual Background

By way of history, the Veteran filed an original claim for entitlement to service connection for recurrent urinary tract infections in December 2011 which was denied in an August 2013 rating decision based on findings that there was no in service incurrence of the Veteran's claimed disability and his disability did not result from or was aggravated by a service - connected disability. The Veteran appealed and an August 2016 Board decision denied service connection for recurrent UTIs and as such, the decision became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

On October 31, 2017, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ fully developed claim seeking reopening of the claim of entitlement to service connection for Peyronie's disease which was denied in a December 2017 rating decision based on no submission of new and material evidence.  There was no new and material evidence associated with the claims file within a year of that rating decision.

On April 4, 2018, and November 1, 2018, the Veteran filed new VA 21-526EZ fully developed claims seeking service connection for Peyronie's disease.

On November 1, 2018, the Veteran also filed an intent to file a claim form.

A February 8, 2019, rating decision denied service connection for recurrent urinary tract infections.  There was no new and material evidence associated with the claims file within a year of that rating decision.

On October 31, 2019, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim seeking to reopen the previously denied claim for service connection for UTIs. 

Thereafter, procedurally, a November 2019 rating decision did not find new and relevant evidence, a January 2020 rating decision found a duty to assist (DTA) error and a February 2020 rating decision found that new and relevant evidence had been received and deemed the claim for entitlement to service connection for recurrent UTI to be reconsidered. An April 2022 Board decision remanded the Veteran's claim for further development. 

Thereafter, procedurally, a November 2022 rating decision confirmed the previous denial of service connection, a February 2023 rating decision found a duty to assist (DTA) error and a March 2023 rating decision granted service connection for voiding dysfunction with recurrent UTI effective November 1, 2018. The grant was based on the March 2023 VA examiner's medical opinion that the Veteran's current disability was at least as likely as not incurred in service or caused by an in-service injury based on findings that the Veteran had a bad case of prostatitis during active duty in 1982, recurrent sexually transmitted diseases in 1983 and 1984, and 5 episodes of UTIs since 1991. The Board notes that the favorable opinion referenced a period of service considered other than honorable.

Analysis

The Board finds that an effective date earlier than November 1, 2018, for the grant of service connection voiding dysfunction with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) is not warranted. Although the Veteran filed several claims which could be interpreted as entitlement to service connection for voiding dysfunction with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) as noted above, he did not appeal the those claims, and those decisions became final. There were no relevant records, either constructively or otherwise associated, within a year of any rating decision denying the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (b). Controlling regulations and case law dictate that when a claim has been finally adjudicated and then reopened later, the effective date of any subsequent award is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (q)(2). If there is a prior final VA denial of the benefit sought, the effective date cannot be earlier than a subsequent claim to reopen. Leonard v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 447 (2004); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 246-50 (2002).

Here, VA received the Veteran's intent to file a claim on November 1, 2018. To preserve an effective date, an intent to file a claim may be submitted to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, appropriate to the benefit sought within one-year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). The Veteran's claim seeking entitlement to service connection for recurrent UTI's was filed within one year of that date on October 31, 2019. The record reflects that the Veteran continuously prosecuted that claim until the March 2023 rating decision granted service connection for his disability.

While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's claim that symptoms of his recurrent UTIs began in 1982, the effective date for an award of service connection is not based on the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but on the date of the claim for service connection or in the Veteran's case the date of claim after a previous final denial in August 2016. See Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377 (1999); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

Accordingly, the Board finds that November 1, 2018, is the correct date for the grant of service connection for a voiding dysfunction due to recurrent UTIs. The Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date herein is without merit and is therefore denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 24, 2012, for the grant of service connection for left leg length discrepancy (LLD) is denied.

In his April 2023 VA Form 10182 NOD the Veteran generally contends that the effective onset for his left leg discrepancy should be prior to April 14, 1999. He seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection.

Factual Background

The Veteran filed VA Form 21-526b Supplemental Claim seeking service connection for left leg shortening secondary to the left ankle on January 24, 2012. The March 2023 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for left leg discrepancy effective January 24, 2012.

Analysis

The Board finds that an effective date earlier than January 24, 2012, for the grant of service connection for left leg length discrepancy (LLD) is not warranted. The Veteran first indicated that he wished to be service connected for a left leg discrepancy in a January 24, 2021 claim.

The Veteran's January 24, 2012, claim was granted by a March 2023 rating decision and was properly effectuated on January 24, 2012, the date of that claim. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date herein is without merit and is therefore denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an initial rating for voiding dysfunction with recurrent urinary tract infections associated with Peyronie's disease with erectile dysfunction, status post trauma greater than 40 percent prior to June 20, 2022, greater than 20 percent prior to March 14, 2023, and greater than noncompensable thereafter is remanded.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR THE REGIONAL OFFICE (RO) ADJUDICATOR: 

Remand is warranted to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the March 2023 rating decision. The Board notes that prescription prostate medication is documented in the Veteran's VA treatment records. In rating voiding dysfunction, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication since such are not contemplated in the rating criteria. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). While VA afforded the Veteran an examination in March 2023, it is not clear whether the examiner reported the Veteran's symptoms in the absence of prostate medication. Accordingly, remand for a new medical opinion is warranted. 

THE REMAND DIRECTIVES FOLLOW.

2. Obtain an opinion regarding the following from an appropriate examiner.

a)	Clearly indicate whether any medications (over the counter or prescription) the Veteran used affected the level of severity of his voiding dysfunction as of the March 2023 examination.

b)	If any such medication was productive of ameliorative affects, clearly identify such effects and opine as to the severity of the voiding dysfunction absent such medication as of the March 2023 examination. 

The Board notes that the claims folder must be provided to and reviewed by the examiner for all post-remand cases per AOJ policy. See VBA Manual M21-1, Part IV.i.2.A.8.b. Thus, the examiner must specifically note that the claims folder was received and reviewed in the body of the examination report. 

All requested opinions must be supported with a rationale based on generally accepted medical principles and the examiner's medical training and expertise.

3. Readjudicate.
