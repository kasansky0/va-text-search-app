ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his migraine headaches began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for migraine headaches are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2003 to April 2005.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Finally, while the period to change dockets under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has not elapsed, a docket switch waiver letter, in accordance with Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024) is not necessary because this decision represents a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal. Thus, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding to adjudicate the issue on appeal on the merits. 

Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is granted.

The Veteran asserts that entitlement to service connection for his migraine headaches is warranted. Specifically, he asserts that he started having extremely bad migraines while in service and has them today for which he takes migraine medications, but it does not help all the time. See January 2024 VA 21-526EZ. For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is warranted.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be established for a current disability on the basis of a presumption that certain chronic diseases, to include organic diseases of the nervous system, manifesting themselves to a certain degree within a certain time after service must have had their onset in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309(a). For organic diseases of the nervous system, the disease must have manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3). Migraine headaches are considered an organic disease of the nervous system. See also Giles v. McDonough, 987 F.3d 1370, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

If there is no manifestation within one year of service, service connection for a recognized chronic disease can still be established through continuity of symptomatology. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (2013). Continuity of symptomatology requires the chronic disease to have manifested in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). In-service manifestation means a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings. Id. 

Lay evidence, if competent and credible, may serve to establish a nexus in certain circumstances. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (2009) (noting that lay evidence is not incompetent merely for lack of contemporaneous medical evidence). When considering whether lay evidence may be competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that whether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When, after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding service origin, the degree of disability, or any other point, such doubt should be resolved in favor of the claimant. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). In the May 2024 rating decision, the RO favorably found that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability of migraine headaches and that the Veteran's participation in toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) is conceded.

In support of his claim, the Veteran submitted a buddy statement from J.A., in January 2024, which noted that the Veteran had migraine headaches for over ten years and his medical records reflect that. In January 2024, the Veteran also provided a note from provider P.H., which stated that the Veteran has been in treatment for migraine headaches since July 2023 and has a 10-year history of migraine headaches. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for headaches in March 2024. The Veteran reported that his headaches started years ago and over the past 5 years they have been consistent and intense. The Veteran reported his triggers are unknown and the headaches can occur at day or night and two to three times a week. The Veteran reported he has to lay down with an ice pack and being in the dark helps. He also reported that he has nausea and vomits at times and feels some relief with that. The Veteran reported that he has seen a neurologist for this in the past. The Veteran reported taking the medications, Ubrelvy and Excedrin for his migraine headaches. 

The Veteran's headache pain symptoms were noted as pulsating or throbbing head pain and pain in the frontal and top of the head. The Veteran's non-headache symptoms were noted as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light. The Veteran reported that duration of typical head pain was less than one day. He reported having characteristic prostrating attacks once every two months. He reported that he has frequent occurrences of headaches and pain, sickness caused him to miss work, and he lost his most recent job as he ran out of paid time off.

The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's migraine headaches was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran. In the rationale, the examiner stated that the Veteran was given the diagnosis of migraine headaches on the day of the examination. The examiner found that the TERA memorandum was reviewed, and it noted non-deployment related exposure. The examiner opined that there is currently no available evidence or research to suggest that migraines are due to toxic exposures, and it is less likely than not that the Veteran's migraines are due to TERA.

In reviewing the evidence of record, the Board notes several complaints of migraine headaches by the Veteran going as far back as 2008. In a July 2008 medical examination, the Veteran complained that his headaches started about the time he joined the military. The Veteran reported that he had headaches on a weekly basis and they lasted four or five hours and were occipital and bitemporal. The Veteran reported that when he got a headache he would lie down and take Tylenol and would have some dizziness but no nausea or vomiting. The Veteran was noted positive for headaches in an October 2014 treatment note. In a January 2013 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he associated his tinnitus with headaches. In an April 2013 treatment note, migraine was noted as a condition in the Veteran's past medical history. In a September 2013 treatment note, the Veteran complained of headaches and vomiting associated with it. In a November 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported headaches among other symptoms while in active duty. The Veteran has other numerous complaints of migraine and headaches including in treatment notes from July 2022, August 2022, January 2023 and October 2023. Here, the Veteran credibly and competently reported that his migraine headaches started in service and have continued since and has established continuity of symptomology. 

As for the March 2024 VA medical opinion, the Board finds it inadequate and affords it low probative weight. First, The VA examiner did not opine as to direct service connection. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123-24 (2007) (holding that a medical nexus opinion finding a condition is not related to service because the condition is not entitled to presumptive service connection, without first considering direct service connection, is inadequate on its face). Next, the VA examiner did not consider the Veteran's lay contentions that his migraine headaches started in active service. The VA examiner also did not consider the January 2024 buddy statement and private medical note showing that the Veteran has a 10-year history of migraine headaches, and instead the VA examiner opined that the Veteran was only diagnosed with migraines in the March 2024 VA examination.

Based upon the Veteran's competent and credible evidence of symptoms of migraine headaches beginning in service and continuing since, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least evenly balanced in showing that his migraine headaches had an onset during service. Thus, the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that entitlement to service connection for?migraine headaches?is warranted. See?38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Wise v. Shinseki,?26?Vet. App.?517?(2014).
