ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, including anxiety and depression, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran did not file a timely notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) within one year of notification of the June 2014 rating decision which denied service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder, and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182.

2. The weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disability during or contemporaneous to the appeal period.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an extension for the filing of a VA Form 10182 have not been met and the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was not otherwise timely received.  38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, including anxiety and depression, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1132, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2009 to September 2012.

In the July 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD

An appeal of a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) consists of a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) submitted to the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 20.201.  A claimant must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).  If a Notice of Disagreement is not filed within the one-year period, the decision becomes final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d)(2), 20.1103.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) in October 2013, which sought service connection for PTSD and all other mental health conditions, among other issues.  A June 2014 rating decision denied the claim for service connection to PTSD.  The Veteran did not submit a notice of disagreement within one year of notification of that decision.

The Veteran then submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) in November 2020, which sought service connection for depression, PTSD, alcohol abuse, and an anxiety condition, among other claims.  In a November 2020 letter, VA informed the Veteran that the claims for PTSD and alcohol abuse were not proper because VA had previously denied those claims and advised the Veteran to file those claims using VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, if the Veteran had new and relevant evidence for VA to consider.  The claims file does not contain evidence that the Veteran responded to this notification or otherwise filed a supplemental claim, as advised.

A February 2021 rating decision denied the Veteran's claims for anxiety and depression.  The Veteran then filed a July 2021 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, listing the denial of anxiety and depression from a rating decision issued in February 2021 in addition to the denial of PTSD from a rating decision issued June 2014.

Thus, the Veteran attempted to appeal a rating decision over six years after the decision was issued, and over five years after the decision became final.

The Board is mindful of the recent decision in Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024), in which the Court held the one-year deadline to file a legacy NOD is not a jurisdictional bar to Board review, but a mandatory claims-processing rule. The Ferko decision dealt with the timeliness of a legacy NOD; however, the reasoning behind the Ferko ruling is applicable to the filing of an Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) NOD.  Therefore, the one-year deadline to file a VA Form 10182 (60 days for a contested claim) is a mandatory claims-processing rule subject to waiver by the Board.

Under Ferko and Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021), it is expected that it could be similarly held that the time period to submit a modernized NOD (VA Form 10182) provided in current 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1) is not jurisdictional, but a claims-processing rule.  See also Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. 428 (2011).

Importantly, the Board may apply the exception under 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b), which applies to NODs and permits extensions to VA's internal deadlines for good cause. See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024).  Section 3.109(b) states that a request for an extension of a time limit must be submitted concurrent with or after the untimely submission is made, and that good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 

Here, the Veteran did not submit an accompanying or subsequently submitted good cause argument for the untimely VA Form 10182.

Given the foregoing, the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was defective and untimely.  As such, the appeal as listed above is dismissed as untimely on the grounds of a procedural defect.  See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 334 (2021).

The Board encourages the Veteran to file a supplemental claim to allow the AOJ to further develop the Veteran's claim. The Board also acknowledges that there were documents added to the Veteran's claims file during a period in which the Board may not examine, and thus there may be evidence in the claims file to support the Veteran's claim.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, including anxiety and depression 

Service connection may be established for disability caused by disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304. To establish service connection for a claimed disability, there must be (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence, generally medical, of a causal relationship between the claimed in service disease or injury and the current disability.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247 (1999).

Service connection may also be established for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 U.S.C. § 1113 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d); Cosman v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 503 (1992).  The disease entity for which service connection is sought must be chronic rather than acute and transitory in nature.  For the showing of chronic disease in service, a combination of manifestations must exist sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word chronic.

Secondary service connection may be established for a disability that is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

Competent lay evidence means any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience.  Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of the facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2).  Lay testimony is competent when it regards the readily observable features or symptoms of injury or illness and may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Veteran is competent to provide testimony concerning factual matters of which he has firsthand knowledge, such as experiencing a physical symptom such as pain.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005).  Therefore, the Board must assess the competence and credibility of lay statements.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).

Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while weight and credibility are factual determinations going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted. Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67 (1997).

A veteran need only demonstrate that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence to prevail.  To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must be against the claim.  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996).

While the Board must provide reasons and bases supporting a decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the evidence submitted by or on behalf of the Veteran. Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence).  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence of record.  The Veteran should not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed.  Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000).

Analysis

The Veteran asserts that service connection for a psychiatric disability, including anxiety and depression, is warranted because they were caused by an in-service event, injury, or exposure.

The AOJ favorably found in the rating decision on appeal that the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during the Veteran's service. The Veteran's January 2012 service medical record shows that the Veteran was diagnosed and treated for adjustment disorder with anxiety.  As there is no clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary of this favorable finding, the Board is bound by it.

The crux of the Veteran's appeal is whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis for a psychiatric condition that can be related to the qualifying in-service event that VA has conceded.

The Board finds that the evidence of record does not show that the Veteran has a currently diagnosed psychiatric disability. Therefore, as the weight of evidence is against a finding that the Veteran has a currently diagnosed psychiatric condition, the claim for service connection is denied.

The threshold consideration for any service connection claim is the existence of a current disability.  In the absence of proof of a present disability, there is no valid claim for service connection.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).  Here, the evidence of record shows no competent evidence of a currently diagnosed psychiatric condition.

An analysis of post-service medical records shows no currently diagnosed psychiatric disability.  August 2014 and September 2015 VA treatment records show negative PTSD and depression screens, and a report of no anxiety.

The Veteran has not submitted competent evidence that demonstrates a current psychiatric disability during the claim period.  No post-service treatment record documents a psychiatric disability.

A March 2014 VA PTSD examination did not diagnose any mental health disability with the exception of alcohol abuse.  Although alcohol abuse may serve as a symptom of another mental health condition, it is not a disability for VA purposes.

A February 2021 VA mental disorders examination did not diagnose the Veteran   with any mental health condition.

The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements of October 2013, November 2020, and July 2021.  The Board finds the Veteran credible and competent to report on his feelings of sadness, anxiety, and fear following stressful events while deployed to Iraq, as well as the family stressors that the Veteran experienced while on active duty.  However, the Veteran is not competent to make a clinical diagnosis of any particular disability based on this symptom.

The Board finds that, the Veteran, as a layperson without the appropriate medical training and expertise, is not competent to provide a diagnosis of a psychiatric condition, as such must be based upon a clinical evaluation by a trained provider.  In addition, the Veteran has not provided competent evidence that he has been diagnosed with a current psychiatric condition. Therefore, as there is no competent evidence to show a current psychiatric condition, to include anxiety and depression, service connection is denied.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran has also asserted that service connection is warranted for a psychiatric condition. However, as the Board has determined there is no competent evidence of a current psychiatric disability, such as anxiety or depression, secondary service connection is not warranted as a matter of law.

Additionally, the Board notes that that VA has conceded that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) by conceding Persian Gulf War service and non-deployment exposure based on the Veteran's MOS of Petroleum Supply Specialist.  Under 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a)(1), the Secretary of VA shall provide a veteran with a medical examination and obtain a medical opinion "if a veteran submits to the Secretary a claim for compensation for a service-connected disability with evidence of a disability and evidence of participation in a toxic exposure risk activity during" service.  However, in this case, as the Veteran does not have a current psychiatric disability, a TERA examination and medical opinion are not warranted.

The Board acknowledges that VA is statutorily required to resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an outstanding issue.  However, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding of any diagnosis of a current psychiatric disability, or that any psychiatric disability is related to active 

service.  Therefore, the claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include anxiety and depression, is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
