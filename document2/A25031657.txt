ORDER

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for service-connected lumbosacral strain residuals is denied.

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for service-connected left lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy is denied.

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for service-connected right lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating on the basis of individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's lumbar spine condition did not exhibit unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

2. The Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy manifested by symptoms consistent with moderate incomplete paralysis.

3. The Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy manifested by symptoms consistent with moderate incomplete paralysis.

4. Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence of record supports finding his service-connected disabilities precluded him from obtaining and retaining substantially gainful employment from June 3, 2004.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for lumbosacral strain residuals are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38C.F.R. §§4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a; Diagnostic Code (DC) 5235-5244.

3. The criteria for an evaluation of in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 4.1, 4.7, 4.20, 4.27, 4.40, 4.124a; DC 8520.

4. The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities are met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.341, 4.3, 4.15, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service with the Air Force from September 1971 to September 1975 and September 1978 to June 1982. 

A December 1989 Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) decision granted entitlement to service connection for a lumbosacral strain and denied entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral degenerative disc disease and degenerative arthritis.  A January 1990 rating decision implemented the Board grant of service connection for lumbosacral strain residuals finding the disability was noncompensable effective September 9, 1987.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and it became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  

In June 2004, the Veteran sought entitlement to an increased rating for his service-connected lumbosacral strain residuals.  An August 2004 rating decision granted entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation for lumbosacral strain residuals effective November 3, 2003.  Following the receipt of additional evidence, an April 2005 rating decision denied entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for the lumbar spine disability.  The Veteran timely appealed.  In January 2009, the Veteran testified before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) and a transcript of that hearing is in the evidence of record.  A July 2009 Board decision remanded the Veteran's claim for additional development.  

A December 2010 rating decision granted entitlement to a 40 percent evaluation for service-connected lumbosacral strain residuals effective October 29, 2020.  The claim returned to the Board and in March 2011 was remanded for a requested new hearing following his notification the VLJ who conducted the January 2009 hearing was no longer employed by the Board.  In November 2011, the Veteran testified before a different VLJ, and a transcript of that hearing is in the evidence of record.  

A March 2012 Board decision remanded the Veteran's claims for additional development.  In February 2013, the Board granted entitlement to a 20 percent evaluation for lumbosacral strain residuals prior to October 29, 2010, and denied entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent since October 29, 2010.  At this time, the Board found the claims for TDIU and separate ratings for neurological manifestations due to the lumbosacral strain were raised by the record and remanded for further development.  

The Court has held that a request for TDIU, whether expressly raised by a veteran or reasonably raised by the record, is not a separate claim for benefits, but rather involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability or disabilities, either as part of the initial adjudication of a claim or, if a disability upon which entitlement to TDIU is based has already been found to be service connected, as part of a claim for increased compensation.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009); see also Roberson v. Principi, 253 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  In other words, the claim for a TDIU can be part-and-parcel of an increased rating claim when such a claim is expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record.  Rice, 22 Vet. App. 477 (2009).  In the present case, the claim for TDIU was found to be raised as part-and-parcel of the June 2004 increased rating claim for the lumbosacral strain residuals.  

The Veteran subsequently appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court).  However, the September 2013 Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) found the Veteran did not challenge the Board's determination granting entitlement to a 20 percent evaluation for lumbosacral strain residuals prior to October 29, 2010, and denying entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent since October 29, 2010.  The Court noted that the issues of entitlement to a TDIU and whether the Veteran was entitled to separate ratings for neurological manifestations, to include bladder impairment and radiculopathy, due to his lumbosacral strain were remanded, and therefore, could not be addressed at this time.  

An October 2013 rating decision implemented the February 2013 Board grant of entitlement to a 20 percent evaluation for lumbosacral strain residuals effective November 3, 2003 to October 29, 2010.  

In March 2014, the Board remanded the Veteran's claims for entitlement to a TDIU and separate ratings for neurological manifestations due to service-connected residuals of a lumbosacral strain for additional development.  An August 2015 rating decision denied entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for the lumbosacral strain residuals but granted entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy at 10 percent disabling effective December 20, 2004, and left lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy at 10 percent disabling effective December 20, 2004.  The August 2015 rating decision denied entitlement to a TDIU.  

An August 2016 Board decision noted the August 2015 rating decision findings were appealed with a request for the Decision Review Officer process and would not be addressed at this time.  Remand of the above issues was necessary.  The Board also remanded the TDIU claim to schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to assess whether his service-connected disabilities affected his ability to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment. 

A December 2017 rating decision granted a 20 percent evaluation for right lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy effective August 7, 2014, and a 20 percent evaluation for left lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy effective August 7, 2014.

The claims returned to the Board in March 2019.  The Board denied entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for the lumbosacral strain residuals; denied an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy prior to August 7, 2014, and in excess of 20 percent since August 7, 2014; and denied an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy prior to August 7, 2014, and in excess of 20 percent since August 7, 2014.  The Board remanded entitlement to a TDIU for referral of the claim to the Director of Compensation Service for consideration of an extraschedular evaluation prior to August 7, 2010, in the first instance.  38 § C.F.R. 4.16.

In December 2019, the Director's memorandum concluded that entitlement to TDIU on an extraschedular basis for any period prior to August 7, 2010, was not warranted, the available evidence did not show his service-connected conditions prevented all work prior to August 2010.  

In July 2020, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) denying entitlement to a TDIU.  The appellant opted the claim into the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), by submitting a timely VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), identifying the July 2020 SSOC and electing Direct Review of the TDIU claim.  The Veteran did not appeal the March 2019 Board decision findings regarding the increased rating claims for the lumbosacral strain residuals or the bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and therefore, they became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  

In October 2020, the Board remanded the Veteran's TDIU claim for a VA opinion regarding the functional effect of his service-connected disabilities (lumbosacral strain, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy associated with the lumbosacral strain residuals, and forehead scar) on his ability to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment.  Subsequently, the record showed the scheduled examinations were cancelled at the Veteran's request.  Therefore, the AOJ complied with VA's duty to assist and substantially complied with the Board's remand instructions.  See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991) ("The duty to assist is not always a one-way street"); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(1)(ii) (requiring claimant to cooperate fully with VA's efforts to obtain non-Federal records, including providing authorization for release of records); Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167, 176 (2010) ("It is substantial compliance, not absolute compliance, that is required" under Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).  A March 2022 rating decision found new and relevant evidence was received to reconsider the claim but continued to deny entitlement to a TDIU.  

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, seeking entitlement to a TDIU.  An April 2023 rating decision denied entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for lumbosacral strain residuals, denied entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy, denied entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy, and continued to deny entitlement to a TDIU.  In February 2024, the VA received a VA Form 10182 electing Direct Review of the April 2023 rating decision.    

1. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for service-connected lumbosacral strain residuals is denied.

2. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for service-connected left lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy is denied.

3. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for service-connected right lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy is denied.

Applicable Law and Regulations

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentages contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  However, the evaluation of the same "disability" or the same "manifestations" under various diagnoses is prohibited. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

The Court has held that a veteran may not be compensated twice for the same symptomatology as "such a result would overcompensate the claimant for the actual impairment of his earning capacity."  Brady v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 203, 206 (1993).  This would result in pyramiding, contrary to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  The Court has acknowledged, however, that when a veteran has separate and distinct manifestations attributable to the same injury, he should be compensated under different DCs.  Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259 (1994); Fanning v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 225 (1993).

Separate evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found.  In other words, the evaluations may be "staged."  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (staged ratings are appropriate when the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.); see also Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (2001).  A disability may require re-evaluation in accordance with changes in a veteran's condition.  It is thus essential, in determining the level of current impairment, that the disability be considered in the context of the entire recorded history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

At the time of January 19, 2023, supplemental claim application, the Veteran was service connected for lumbosacral strain residuals at 40 percent disabling under DC 5237 and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy at 20 percent disabling under DC 8520.  

Disorders of the spine are rated under DCs 5235 through 5244 of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  For VA compensation purposes, normal forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is zero to 90 degrees, extension is zero to 30 degrees, left and right lateral flexion are zero to 30 degrees, and left and right lateral rotation are zero to 30 degrees.  The normal combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is 240 degrees.

As of February 7, 2021, DC 5242 revised "degenerative arthritis of the spine" to "degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome."

A 10 percent disability rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.

A 20 percent disability rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.

A 40 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine of 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

A 50 percent disability rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

Finally, a 100 percent disability rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of entire spine.  38C.F.R. §4.71a.

Also, the current schedular rating criteria instructs to evaluate intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS or degenerative disc disease) either under the general rating formula for diseases and injuries of the spine or under the formula for rating IVDS based on incapacitating episodes, whichever method results in the higher evaluation.

The Formula provides a 10 percent disability rating is warranted with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least one week but less than two weeks during the past 12 months; a 20 percent disability rating is warranted with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least two weeks but less than four weeks during the past 12 months; a 40 percent disability rating is warranted with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least four weeks but less than six weeks during the past 12 months; and a 60 percent disability rating is warranted with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least six weeks during the past 12 months.

Note (1): For purposes of evaluations under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes, an incapacitating episode is a period of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.

In evaluating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, it is necessary to consider, along with the schedular criteria, functional loss due to flare ups of pain, fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, and weakness.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  Although pain may cause functional loss, pain itself does not constitute functional loss.  Rather, pain must affect some aspect of "the normal working movements of the body," such as "excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance," to constitute functional loss.  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 38-43 (2011) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40).  38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that VA examinations include joint testing for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight bearing and non-weight bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint.  Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).  Associated objective neurologic abnormalities are evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (General Formula, Note 1).   

Under DC 8520, paralysis of the sciatic nerve, a 10 percent rating is assigned for mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; a 20 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis; a 40 percent rating is assigned for moderately severe incomplete paralysis; a 60 percent rating is assigned for severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy; and an 80 percent rating is assigned for complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve where the foot dangles and drops, there is no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee is weakened or (very rarely) lost.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520.

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various DCs are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of loss or impaired function that is substantially less than that which is described in the criteria for an evaluation for complete paralysis of this nerve, whether the less than total paralysis is due to the varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial nerve regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

Complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve is indicated where the foot dangles and drops, there is no active movement possible of the muscles below the knee, and flexion of the knee is weakened or (very rarely) lost.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520.

In rating peripheral nerve injuries and their residuals, attention should be given to the site and character of the injury and the relative impairment in motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.

When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (reasonable doubt to be resolved in the Veteran's favor); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (the benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies if the competing evidence is in approximate balance).

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran contends entitlement to an increased evaluations for the lumbar spine disability and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities.  

As noted above, a March 2019 Board decision denied entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for the Veteran's lumbosacral strain residuals as well as for evaluations for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy in excess of 10 percent prior to August 7, 2014, and in excess of 20 percent since August 7, 2014.  Entitlement to a TDIU was remanded for development.  Following the issuance of the July 2020 SSOC denying entitlement to a TDIU, the Veteran opted the TDIU claim into the AMA by submitting a VA Form 10182.  The Veteran did not appeal the March 2019 Board decision findings regarding the increased rating claims for the lumbosacral strain residuals or the bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and therefore, they became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  

In response to the March 2022 rating decision's continued denial of entitlement to a TDIU, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in January 2023 seeking entitlement to a TDIU.  This was construed by the RO to include new increased rating claims for the lumbosacral strain residuals and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  

The Board will generally review evidence from the date the VA received the Veteran's increased rating claim and during the one year "look back period" preceding the submission of the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  The appeal period before the Board is from January 19, 2023, the date VA received the supplemental claim plus the one year look back period.  

The Board notes that in January 2022, the Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination regarding his TDIU claim.  The Veteran did not attend the scheduled examination.  A February 2022 subsequent development letter noted attempts to reach him regarding the missed examination and requested a response within 30 days, however, the record indicated no response was timely received.  

As noted above, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim for entitlement to a TDIU in January 2023 and as part of the application reported his failure to attend the scheduled VA examination was due to his health and finances.  The Veteran reported being taken to the emergency room in April 2021 after he was found unconscious in his car.  After that incident, he lost a significant amount of weight and was constantly fatigued and weak through the end of 2021.  He had difficulty getting around.  He also reported the development of health issues for his wife and that his care for her aggravated his own conditions.  He was afraid to attend VA examinations because the testing caused him such pain that he was immobilized the next day.  Despite his inability to attend in-person examinations between 2020 and 2022, he expressed a willingness to attend telehealth appointments going forward. 

In February 2023 and March 2023, the Veteran was scheduled for VA examinations related to his lumbosacral strain residuals and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy conditions.  These did not appear to be telehealth appointments as previously requested by the Veteran and he failed to attend the scheduled appointments.  However, in February 2024, the Veteran through his representative waived his right to further development and asked the Board to promulgate a decision on the evidence of record.      

The Board notes here that the Veteran must be prepared to meet their obligations by cooperating with VA efforts to provide an adequate medical examination.  See Olson v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 480 (1992).  In this regard, the Court has held that "[t]he duty to assist is not always a one-way street.  If a Veteran wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining the putative evidence."  See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).  As such, the Veteran must cooperate in the VA's efforts to obtain evidence needed to adjudicate his claims, including keeping their contact information up to date, attending scheduled VA examinations, and promptly communicating with VA why they cannot attend a scheduled VA examination.

Having reviewed the record evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran has not cooperated with VA efforts to provide the Veteran with an adequate medical examination in 2022 and 2023.  However, he requested in February 2024 a decision on the evidence of record be provided and waived his right to further development of the record.  As such, the Board concludes that a remand to attempt to obtain another VA examination would be fruitless and is not required.  See also Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (holding that remands which would only result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the claimant are to be avoided).

The Board has also considered the applicability of 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a), when entitlement to a benefit cannot be established without a current VA examination or reexamination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination or reexamination, action shall be taken in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.655 (b) or (c) as appropriate.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b) applies to original or reopened claims or claims for increase, while 38 C.F.R. §3.655(c) applies to running awards, when the issue is continuing entitlement.  More specifically, when a claimant fails to report for a scheduled medical examination, without good cause, a claim for an increase shall be denied. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant, and death of an immediate family member.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

The issues on appeal arose from a claim for increase; therefore, if the claimant fails or refuses to report for VA examination without good cause, regulations provide that the claims should be denied.  The Veteran did not report for prior examinations during the pendency of this appeal, indicated that he would not attend any in-person examinations scheduled, requested that no further development be undertaken, and a decision be issued on the evidence of record.  Therefore, the Board finds that it is more appropriate under the circumstances of this case to decide the appeal based on the evidence of record.  The VA fulfilled its' duty to assist the Veteran in developing his increased rating claims before the decision on appeal.  As such, the Board finds that a remand for a new examination is not warranted.  The Veteran had the opportunity to submit additional evidence and has not provided any further evidence.  

The record does not contain medical evidence with findings sufficient to determine the current severity of his lumbosacral spine or bilateral lower extremity disorders in the relevant appeal period.  The most recent VA examinations of record for the lumbar spine and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy conditions were obtained in October 2017.  The October 2017 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with a lumbar strain.  Initial range of motion testing found a forward flexion to 60 degrees, extension to 10 degrees, bilateral lateral flexion to 20 degrees, and bilateral later rotation to 20 degrees.  The examiner noted no pain on examination but tenderness to palpation of the spine.  The Veteran performed repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions without additional loss of function or range of motion.  He was examined immediately after repeated use over time, but the examiner was unable to state without mere speculation whether pain, weakness, fatiguability, or incoordination significantly limited his functional ability with repeated use over time.  

Testing regarding flare ups was found inapplicable.  The examiner opined that it was impossible to determine or quantify without speculating whether pain, weakness, fatigability, lack of endurance, or incoordination limited his functional ability during a flare up or with repeated use over time.  The Veteran complained of pain with active range of motion.  Contralateral pain with weight bearing, non-weight bearing, and passive range of motion was not physiologically possible to assess.  The examiner indicated an inability to locate any medical decision attributing the disc disease and spondylosis as secondary to a lumbar strain.  Lumbar strains were not a cause of the future development of disc degeneration and arthritis was not the cause of the Veteran's radiculopathy.  Consequently, flare ups, functional loss, and occupational effect could not be assessed due to a comorbid non-service-connected condition.  The examiner found no evidence of guarding or muscle spasms of the thoracolumbar spine, exhibited no muscle atrophy, had normal reflexes, and normal sensation.  The examiner noted moderate bilateral radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve.  There was no evidence of ankylosis or intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS).  

In a separate October 2017 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with L4-L5/L5-S1 radiculopathy.  He had severe constant pain and numbness in the bilateral lower extremities.  However, he retained normal strength and exhibited no muscle atrophy.  His reflexes and sensation in the lower extremities were normal.  His gait was antalgic, but this was attributed to a right knee condition.  The Veteran's peripheral nerve condition and/or peripheral neuropathy condition impacted his ability to work.  The Veteran reported an inability to walk, sit, or stand for long periods of time.  

In a December 2018 addendum opinion, the VA examiner stated that the Veteran was granted service connection for a lumbar strain in 1987 and had many subsequent examinations for the lumbar strain.  An August 2014 VA examination listed degenerative arthritis of the spine as the entered diagnosis.  Although the Veteran did have age related degenerative disc disease at that time it was unrelated to the remote lumbar strain as a lumbar strain does not cause future lumbar degenerative disc disease of spondylosis.  The examiner was unable to locate any medical opinions contradicting this.  Essentially the diagnosis of L5-S1 disc disease, from a service connection perspective, was in error.  The August 2014 examination incorrectly replaced the service connection diagnosis of a lumbar strain, and no medical provider gave an opinion linking the lumbar degenerative disease and lower extremity radiculopathy conditions as being related to the lumbar strain. 

Where the VA undertakes to provide the Veteran with an examination, it must be adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).  The Board notes that the October 2017 VA examiner indicated that lumbar spine flare ups, functional loss, and occupational effect could not be assessed due to a comorbid non-service-connected condition.  The examiner reported an inability to locate any medical decision attributing the disc disease and spondylosis as secondary to a lumbar strain.  The December 2018 addendum opinion found the Veteran had age related degenerative disc disease unrelated to the remote lumbar strain as a lumbar strain does not cause future lumbar degenerative disc disease or spondylosis.  

Neither the October 2017 nor the December 2018 VA examiner opinions adequately explained the development of arthritis and degenerative disc disease in the lumbar spine as it related to his service-connected lumbar strain disability.  Additionally, the December 2018 VA examiner also questioned the August 2014 VA examiner's linking of lumbar degenerative disease and lower extremity radiculopathy conditions as being related to the lumbar strain.  Therefore, these opinions were accorded limited probative weight.  As discussed in detail above, the RO attempted to supplemental the evidence of record during the applicable appeal period with current examinations of the Veteran's lumbar spine and bilateral lower extremities radiculopathy, but the Veteran requested no further development and that a decision on the record be made.    

The Board finds the Veteran's forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine was no worse than 30 degrees of less.  Additionally, the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was productive of moderate incomplete paralysis.  During the period on appeal, there was no evidence of unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine warranting a 50 percent evaluation.  Nor was there evidence of moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve warranting 40 percent evaluations for the bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  

Accordingly, based on the available evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence showed entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for lumbosacral strain residuals and in excess of 20 percent for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was not warranted.

4. Entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities is granted.

Applicable Law and Regulations

Total disability will be considered to exist where there is present any impairment of mind and body that is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340.  Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of service-connected disabilities, provided that the Veteran meets the schedular requirements.  If there is only one service-connected disability, this disability should be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one should be rated at 40 percent or more with sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combination to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

To meet the requirement of "one 60 percent disability" or "one 40 percent disability," the following will be considered as one disability: (1) disability of one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from one common etiology; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; and (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war.  Substantially gainful employment is defined as work which is more than marginal, and which permits the individual to earn a living wage.  Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991).

In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but it may not be given to his or her age or to any impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

If a Veteran fails to meet the threshold minimum percentage standards enunciated in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), rating boards should refer to the Director of Compensation and Pension Service for extraschedular consideration all cases where the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b); see also Fanning v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 225 (1993).

Thus, despite the Veteran not meeting the percentage requirements for a TDIU, the Board must evaluate whether there are circumstances in the Veteran's case, apart from any non-service-connected conditions and advancing age which would have justified a TDIU.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341(a), 4.19; see Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993); see also Hodges v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 375 (1993); Blackburn v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 395 (1993).  The Veteran's service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue must be addressed.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

The Board emphasizes entitlement to an extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1) and a TDIU extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b), although similar, are based on different factors.  See Kellar v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 157 (1994).  An extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1), as discussed above, is based on the fact that the schedular ratings are inadequate to compensate for the average impairment of earning capacity due to the Veteran's disability.  Exceptional or unusual circumstances, such as frequent hospitalization or marked interference with employment, are required.  In contrast, 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) merely requires a determination that a particular veteran is rendered unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of his or her service-connected disabilities.  See VAOPGCPREC 6-96.

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran contended he was unable to work because of his service-connected disabilities. 

As noted above, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU was raised as part-and-parcel of the Veteran's June 2004 increased rating claim for the lumbosacral strain residuals.  Pursuant to Rice, no formal claim of TDIU is required.

The Veteran is service connected for lumbosacral strain residuals at a noncompensable rate effective September 9, 1987 to November 3, 2003, 20 percent disabling effective November 3, 2003 to October 29, 2010, and 40 percent disabling effective October 29, 2010; left lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy associated with lumbosacral strain residuals at 10 percent disabling effective December 20, 2004 to August 7, 2014, and 20 percent disabling effective August 7, 2014; right lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy associated with lumbosacral strain residuals at 10 percent disabling effective December 20, 2004 to August 7, 2014, and 20 percent disabling effective August 7, 2014; a forehead scar at a noncompensable rate from September 20, 1975 to August 9, 2014, under DC 7800, and 10 percent disabling effective August 7, 2014, under DC 7804.  

From September 20, 1975 to November 3, 2003, the Veteran's overall combined disability evaluation was noncompensable.  From November 3, 2003 to December 20, 2004, the Veteran's overall combined disability evaluation was 20 percent disabling.  From December 20, 2004 to October 29, 2010, the Veteran's overall combined disability evaluation was 40 percent disabling.  From October 29, 2010 to August 7, 2014, the Veteran's overall combined disability evaluation was 50 percent disabling.  As a result, the Veteran did not meet the schedular requirements for a TDIU prior to August 7, 2014.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  Nevertheless, where the schedular criteria set forth above are not met, but the Veteran is nonetheless found to be unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, the VA shall submit the case to the Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular consideration.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

An extraschedular TDIU may be assigned in the case of a Veteran who fails to meet the percentage requirements but who is unemployable by reason of service-connected disability under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1).  The Board cannot assign an extraschedular rating in the first instance, see Thun v. Shinseki, 572 F.3d 1366 (2009).  Although the Board must refer an extraschedular TDIU to the Director of Compensation Service in the first instance, the Board reviews entitlement to extraschedular TDIU thereafter on a de novo basis.  Kuppamala v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 447 (2015).  The Board is not bound by the Director's decision or otherwise limited in its scope of review by that determination.  Wages v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 233, 236-38 (2015) (citing 38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b)).

The Board remanded the Veteran's claim for consideration of the claim for extraschedular TDIU by the Director of Compensation Service in March 2019.  In December 2019, the Director's memorandum concluded that entitlement to TDIU on an extraschedular basis for any period prior to August 7, 2010, was not warranted, the available evidence did not show his service-connected conditions prevented all work prior to August 2010.  However, the Board notes that the Director's decision is not evidence, but, rather, the de facto AOJ decision, and the Board must conduct de novo review of this decision.  Wages v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 233, 238-39 (2015) (holding that the Board conducts de novo review of the Director's decision denying extraschedular consideration).  Therefore, the Board will now independently consider whether the Veteran is entitled to an extraschedular TDIU.

From August 7, 2014, on the Veteran's overall combined disability evaluation was 70 percent disabling.   As a result, the Veteran met the schedular requirements for a TDIU.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  Having met the objective criteria for a TDIU, the remaining question before the Board is whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities preclude him from securing or following substantially gainful employment since August 7, 2014.  38 C.F.R. § 3.321, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his age or to any impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § § 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

"Substantially gainful employment" is that employment "which is ordinarily followed by the nondisabled to earn their livelihood with earnings common to the particular occupation in the community where the veteran resides."  Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991).  Marginal employment is not considered to be substantially gainful employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Marginal employment generally shall be deemed to exist when a veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person.  Id.; see also Poverty Thresholds, U.S. Census Bureau, http://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html (last visited April 2, 2025).  Marginal employment may also be held to exist, on a facts-found basis, when earned annual income does not exceed the poverty threshold.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  This includes, but is not limited to, employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop.  Id.  As such, "a veteran can establish marginal employment either by demonstrating an income less than the poverty threshold established by the U.S. Census Bureau or by the facts of his particular case."  Ortiz-Valles v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 65, 71 (2016).

In this regard, work need not be on a less than full-time basis to be considered marginal.  In Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000), the Court affirmed the Board's denial of TDIU when the claimant had engaged in part-time work which, nevertheless, brought him earnings which exceeded the poverty threshold for one person.  Id. at 356.  The sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough; the ultimate question is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).

In January 2009, the Veteran testified that his back condition prevented him from working.  He tried to work as a security guard but could not perform the job duties.  He reported no work since 2004.  However, he did not testify that he was terminated specifically due to his back condition.  In November 2011, the Veteran testified to increased severity in his low back disability.  He reported a lot of pain, he could not lift, and had difficulty bending.  He could hardly get up from a chair, laid down frequently, and was not currently working.  During a typical day, if he did light work, he would be bedridden after, potentially up to two days.  He testified to issues with muscle spasms and radiating pain down his legs.  He hired someone to assist with yard work and his wife performed most of the household chores and cooking.    

In October 2013, the Veteran submitted a work history report to the Social Security Administration (SSA) as part of his disability application.  He reported working as a Credit Card Debt Collector from September 2004 to June 2005, full-time (40 hours per week), and earned $9/hr; as a Security Officer from September 2000 to September 2004, 50 hours a week, and earned $7.50/hr; and as a Temporary Worker from January 1998 to September 2000, full-time (40 hour per week), and earned $8/hr.   

In October 2013, the Veteran also provided a function report as part of his SSA disability claim.  He reported an inability to function or perform even simple tasks for any sort of extended time.  He had physical and mental impairments, severe pain, and severe fatigue that hindered/limited his ability to work.  All his body joints, muscles, ligaments, tendons, and tissues were rapidly being destroyed by his overactive immune system, brain, and central nervous system.  His extreme pain and fatigue limited his conscious hours.  When he was awake, he ate meals prepared for him but often had to lie down.  He needed reminders to groom and take prescribed medications.  Overall, he had difficulty with lifting, squatting, bending, standing, reaching, walking, sitting, kneeling, talking, hearing, stair climbing, seeing, memory, completing tasks, concentrating, understanding, following instructions, and using his hands.  He could lift up to three pounds and walk less than one block.  

In August 2014, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940, Veterans Application for Increase Compensation Based on Unemployability.  He contended that due to all his service-connected disabilities he was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.  He became too disabled to work on April 20, 2004.  He reported having two years of college education and earned an associate's degree in Health Care Infomatics.  He last worked in collections for Van RU Credit Corporation, 40 hours a week, from January 2004 to April 2004.  His service-connected conditions impacted his ability to work because he was limited in his ability to walk, sit, stand, bend, twist, lift, and climb.  He currently used a cane, walker, or wheelchair to get around due to the severity of his back condition.  

An August 2014 VA Form 21-4192, Request for Employment Information in Connection with Claim for Disability Benefits, submitted by the Van RU Credit Corporation indicated the Veteran worked full-time as a collection specialist from November 8, 2004 to March 1, 2005.  His employment was terminated for insubordination.  A 2005 W2 from Van RU Credit Corporation was associated with the claims file in August 2014.  The document showed gross pay of $3,365.73.  

In January 2018, the VA received earnings records from SSA.  A review of those records showed $13,385.90 was earned in 2003, $4,405.62 in 2004, and $3,409.51 in 2005.  There was a marked decrease in the Veteran's earnings beginning in 2004.  

The Veteran is competent to provide testimony concerning factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge and experience through his senses.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007); Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005).     

The federal poverty average threshold for a family size of one, under 65 years old was $9,573 in 2003, $9,827 in 2004, and $10,160 in 2005.  For a family size of two, under 65 years old the threshold was $12,384 in 2003, $12,714 in 2004, and $13,145 in 2005.  See Poverty Thresholds, U.S. Census Bureau, http://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html (last visited April 2, 2025).  The Board finds that despite the report of work into 2004 and 2005 that employment was marginal because the Veteran earned below the federal poverty threshold.  Therefore, the Veteran was not engaged in substantial gainful employment at the time of his June 3, 2004, claim.    

A July 2004 VA treatment record showed the Veteran requesting a medical note for jobs with limited standing, walking, and use of the left hand.  

A February 2006 VA examination diagnosed degenerative disc disease of L5-S1.  The Veteran reported mild fatigue, mild decreased motion, moderate stiffness of the lumbar spine, no weakness, mild spasms of the lumbar spine, and moderate daily lumbar spine pain (aching).  He could walk a quarter mile but had an antalgic gait.  His moderate muscle spasms did not result in abnormal spinal contour.  The Veteran's spinal disability impacted his daily activities.  He had moderate impairment on his ability to perform chores, mild impairment on his ability to shop, moderate impairment on his ability to exercise, moderate impairment on participation in recreational activities, and mild impairment on his ability to travel.  He was prevented from participating in sports.  However, he had no limitation on his ability to feed himself, bathe, dress, toilet, or groom.  The Board notes that in rendering this opinion the February 2006 examiner considered a non-service-connected condition.  The February 2006 VA examiner's opinion failed to explain the relationship between the diagnosed degenerative disc disease and the service-connected lumbar strain disability.  While the Board agreed with the overall finding of functional impact, the consideration of non-relevant factors could not be separated from the conclusion.  Therefore, this opinion was accorded little probative weight.

In March 2006, the Veteran reported performing a lot of online course work and not getting a lot of physical activity.  An April 2007 VA medical treatment note indicated the Veteran was a full-time student and could not perform laboring work.  He was diagnosed with degenerative joint disease of the cervical and lumbar spine with muscular back spasms as well as psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis of the hands.  His pain was assessed as fairly well controlled.  In November 2007, he continued to be identified as a full-time student.  In February 2008, he reported to VA treating providers that he experienced two hours of morning stiffness.  He could open a jar and button with difficulty, could dry himself after a shower, walk five blocks, and perform light laboring work.  

A January 2009 MRI of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel bulging and disc degeneration with multilevel interspace narrowing and end plate disease; mild to moderate spondylosis at all levels; and no definite spinal or neural foramina stenosis.  June 2009 and September 2009 VA treatment records noted lumbar radiculopathy of the L4-5 on the right.  By May 2010, his VA treating providers continued to note that his degenerative joint disease of the cervical and lumbar spine pain continued to be well controlled.  

An October 2010 VA examination diagnosed lumbar spine degenerative joint disease.  This condition impacted his usual occupation because he was assigned different duties, had increased tardiness, and increased absenteeism.  He experienced decreased mobility, problems with lifting and carrying, a lack of stamina, weakness or fatigue, decreased strength, and lower extremity pain.  His back pain limited his ability to shop, travel, participate in recreational or sports activities, and drive.  However, the examination report noted that he was not currently employed and currently was a student.  The Board notes that in rendering this opinion the October 2010 examiner considered non-service-connected condition.  The October 2010 VA examiner's opinion failed to explain the relationship between the diagnosed degenerative joint disease and the service-connected lumbar strain disability.  While the Board agreed with the overall finding of functional impact, the consideration of non-relevant factors could not be separated from the conclusion.  Therefore, this opinion was accorded little probative weight.   

In December 2010, physical examination by VA treating providers found tenderness to palpation of the lumbar spine and decreased range of motion.  His straight leg raise testing was negative bilaterally.  In March and May 2011, he continued to exhibit tenderness to palpation of the lumbar spine and decreased range of motion as well as a slow gait and use of a cane.  

In a May 2012 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with degeneration of the lumbar or lumbosacral interverbal disc, chronic low back pain, spondylosis, lumbar spinal stenosis, and lumbosacral strain.  The VA examiner opine the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine condition impacted his ability to work.  He had range of motion difficulties, back pain, difficulty carrying objects, bending, kneeling, and doing prolonged standing and walking.  The Board notes that in rendering this opinion the May 2012 examiner considered non-service-connected conditions.  The May 2012 VA examiner's opinion failed to explain the relationship between the diagnoses of degeneration of the lumbar or lumbosacral interverbal disc, spondylosis, and lumbar spinal stenosis and the service-connected lumbar strain disability.  While the Board agreed with the overall finding of functional impact, the consideration of non-relevant factors could not be separated from the conclusion.  Therefore, this opinion was accorded little probative weight.

In May 2012, the Veteran reported to VA treating providers that he was able to do his activities of daily living, bathe himself, and dress himself.  Although he performed little work around the house.  He described increased low back pain and radicular pain to the bilateral posterior thighs.  There was no change in his bowel/bladder control.  He was ambulatory with a walker.  He was diagnosed with an exacerbation of lumbar spine degenerative joint disease.  A September 2012 lumbar MRI revealed significant progression of his multilevel degenerative disc disease which now caused severe spinal canal stenosis at L3-L4 and L4-L5.  Additionally, there was moderate spinal canal stenosis at L2-L3; multilevel foraminal stenosis, most prominent and severe bilaterally at L4-L5 and L5-S1; moderate foraminal stenosis on the right at L2-L3 and bilaterally at L3-L4; and multilevel prominent facet hypertrophy from L3-L4 through L5-S1.  The Veteran underwent bilateral transforaminal epidural steroid injection at level L4.  His post-operative diagnosis was chronic low back pain with radiculopathy not responsive to conservative therapy.      

In October 2013, N.L. (the Veteran's wife) provided a third-party function report to SSA.  She reported knowing him 40 years.  He could not sit, walk, stand, or write.  He could not do much of anything else very long and required a lot of rest.  He spent much of his day resting, eating, and attending to some personal hygiene.  N.L. reported that the Veteran needed reminders and some help to dress and bathe, he lacked the strength and energy to care for his hair, could feed himself okay, and needed some help getting to the toilet.  He also needed reminders to take prescribed medications.  He did not prepare his own meals.  

Overall, she reported that her husband had difficulty lifting, squatting, bending, standing, reaching, walking, sitting, kneeling, talking, hearing, stair climbing, seeing, memory, completing tasks, concentration, understanding, following instructions, and using his hands.  He could lift one to three pounds, walk at best one block, and stand five minutes because of his feet.  N.L.'s statement is probative.  She is competent to report her observations and conversations with the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007).

In January 2014, SSA's Disability Determination Services (DDS) assessed the Veteran.  He was diagnosed with the following severe impairments: degenerative disc disease (disorders of back), other disorders of gastrointestinal system, major joint dysfunction, inflammatory arthritis, and asthma.  He had non-severe affective disorder, which resulted in mild difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace.  The Veteran reported independent activities of daily living.  From 2006 to 2010, his activities of daily living were limited by severe fibromyalgia pain.  He could drive short distances, care for his personal hygiene, assist with shopping, and assist with finances.  He was limited by pain but made accommodations for his pain.  

DDS opined the Veteran had the residual functional capacity to perform less than the full range of light work.  The Veteran could occasionally lift and/or carry 20 pounds, 10 pounds frequently; stand and/or walk four hours; sit about six hours in an eight-hour workday; occasionally climb ramps/stairs and crawl; never climb ladders/ropes/scaffolds; frequently balance, stoop, kneel, and crouch; and should avoid concentrated exposure to extreme cold, humidity, vibration, and hazards.  The Veteran had past relevant work in collection of credit card debt and as a security office.  His residual functional capacity would not prevent him from performing his past relevant work in collections of credit card debt.  DDS opined the Veteran was not disabled. 

The Board notes that the VA is required to consider SSA findings.  However, the Board is not bound by the findings of disability and/or unemployability made by other agencies, including SSA.  See Collier v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 413, 417 (1991).  While SSA found the Veteran could return to past relevant work, this assessment of his functional ability did not consider the effect of his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy condition.  A review of the evidence of record showed radiculopathy of L4-5 back to June 2009.  By the August 2014 VA examination, he exhibited moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve and external popliteal nerve, which resulted in difficulty lifting, standing, and walking for prolonged periods.  Therefore, DDS' January 2014 opinion was accorded little probative weight. 

An August 2014 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with degenerative arthritis of the spine.  The Veteran reported currently experiencing severe back pain all the time that radiated to both legs.  Treatment (injections/oral medications) provided him with some relief.  However, he reported flare ups daily caused by any motion of the back.  He reported regular use of a wheelchair, braces, and a walker.  The August 2014 VA examiner opined the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine condition impacted his ability to work.  He had not worked since 2004.  Pain limited his ability to sit the most and he had difficulty sitting at a computer.  He also had difficulty lifting anything heavy.  

As discussed in detail above, the December 2018 VA examiner questioned the August 2014 VA examiner's linking of lumbar degenerative disease to the service-connected lumbar strain.  The August 2014 VA examiner's opinion failed to address the service-connected lumbar strain disability in rendering this opinion or to explain the relationship between the diagnosis of degenerative arthritis of the spine and the service-connected lumbar strain disability.  While the Board agreed with the overall finding of functional impact, the consideration of non-relevant factors could not be separated from the conclusion.  Therefore, this opinion was accorded little probative weight.   

An August 2014 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with radiculopathy in both legs.  Physical examination found moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve and external popliteal (common peroneal) nerve.  The August 2014 VA examiner opined the Veteran's peripheral nerve condition and/or peripheral neuropathy impacted his ability to work.  He had difficulty lifting, standing, and walking for prolonged periods.

An August 2014 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with a forehead scar.  The VA examiner opined the Veteran's forehead scar did not impact his ability to work.  His service-connected scar had no effect on his ability to secure or follow substantially gainful employment.  The examiner believed the Veteran capable of employment in a sedentary job with appropriate reasonable accommodations that would allow change of positions/limit lifting/bending.  The August 2014 VA examinations were probative evidence, as they relied on sufficient facts and data, and provided rationales for the opinions.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993).     

In June 2015, an Administrative Law Judge with SSA opined the Veteran was disabled effective October 1, 2009.  The Veteran had not engaged in substantially gainful activity since 2005.  He had the following severe impairments: degenerative disc disease of the lumbar and cervical regions of the spine with headaches, arthritis, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, shingles, asthma, and torn meniscus of the bilateral knees.  Prior to prior to October 1, 2009, the Veteran had the residual functional capacity to perform light work except he could never climb ramps or stairs; never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; occasionally balance, stoop, crouch, kneel, crawl; frequently handle objects, that is gross manipulation with both hands; frequently finger, that is fine manipulation with both hands; have occasional exposure to moving mechanical parts; occasionally operate a motor vehicle; and have only occasional exposure to unprotected heights.  

Beginning October 1, 2009, the Veteran had the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work except he could never climb ramps or stairs; never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; occasionally balance, stoop, crouch, kneel, crawl; frequently handle objects that is gross manipulation with both hands; frequently finger, that is fine manipulation with both hands; have occasional exposure to moving mechanical parts; occasionally operate a motor vehicle; have occasional exposure to unprotected heights; and sit for 15 minutes, then stand for 15 minutes at a time.

Prior to October 1, 2009, the Veteran could return to his past relevant work as a security guard according to the testimony of a vocational expert.  Since October 1, 2009, the Veteran could not return to any of his past relevant work and had attained an advanced age.  There were no transferable skills to other occupations with the post-October 1, 2009, residual functional capacity, therefore, he could not perform any work in the national economy and was considered disabled.  

The Board notes that VA regulations contain many factors to be considered as part of a TDIU analysis.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.16, 4.19.  Whether a veteran could perform "sedentary work" or "sedentary employment" is not among them.  In fact, neither the term nor any similar phrase is mentioned, much less defined, in any relevant VA statute or regulation.  The Board must sufficiently explain how it interpreted the use of the term "sedentary" and how the concept of sedentary work figures into a veteran's overall disability picture and vocational history.  Withers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 139 (2018).  Withers declines to adopt a specific definition of the phrase "sedentary employment" for VA purposes when adjudicating entitlement to a TDIU, but instead holds, as noted above, that the Board must provide a definition on a case-by-case basis.  

Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines sedentary as doing or requiring much sitting, not physically active.  See https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sedentary.  Under 20 C.F.R. 404.1567(a), SSA defines sedentary work as work that involves lifting no more than 10 pounds at a time and occasionally lifting or carrying articles like docket files, ledgers, and small tools.  Although a sedentary job is defined as one that involves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing is often necessary in carrying out job duties.  Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required occasionally, and other sedentary criteria are met.

The Board finds these definitions are persuasive for purposes of this claim, as the Department of Labor and SSA have expertise in and are charged with defining the exertional requirements of different jobs in the national economy, and SSA is charged with determining the capacity of an individual to satisfy those requirements in adjudicating disability claims. 

The Board notes that the VA is required to consider SSA findings.  However, the Board is not bound by the findings of disability and/or unemployability made by other agencies, including SSA.  See Collier v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 413, 417 (1991).  While the Board agrees with the overall finding of unemployability, the Board notes the Administrative Law Judge's decision took into consideration the Veteran's age as well as non-service-connected disabilities.  The consideration of these factors could not be separated from the Administrative Law Judge's conclusion; therefore, this opinion was given less probative weight than Z.F.'s July 2018 vocational assessment discussed in detail below.  

In October 2015, C.W. (MD), the Veteran's private treating provider completed a disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ).  The Veteran was diagnosed with lumbago, cervicalgia, degenerative disc disease, spondylosis, peripheral neuropathy, sciatica, and osteoarthritis.  Doctor C.W. opined the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine condition impacted his ability to work.  Doctor C.W.'s opinion was accorded less probative weight than Z.F.'s July 2018 vocational assessment discussed in detail below.  Doctor C.W.'s opinion that the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine condition impacted his ability to work appeared to be based in part on conditions that were not currently service connected.  Therefore, while the Board agreed with the overall finding of functional impact, the consideration of non-relevant factors could not be separated from the conclusion.  

A November 2016 lumbar MRI revealed disc bulges and central protrusion L1-2 and L4-5 resulting in mild to moderate canal stenosis and bilateral foraminal narrowing, a disc bulge at L5-S1 with facet arthropathy, and uncovertebral joint hypertrophy resulting in mild canal stenosis and impingement of the bilateral L5 and left S1 nerve root.  In March 2017, private treating providers noted decreased range of motion of the lumbar spine with spasms, decreased strength in the bilateral lower extremities, and an antalgic gait.  

An October 2017 VA examiner diagnosed a forehead scar.  The VA examiner opined the Veteran's scar did not impact his ability to work.  The October 2017 VA examination was probative evidence, as it relied on sufficient facts and data, and provided a rationale for the opinion.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993).     

An October 2017 VA examiner diagnosed a lumbar strain.  The Veteran reported currently experiencing constant lower back pain and stiffness with constant pain radiating down both lower extremities.  The VA examiner provided no response as to whether the lumbar strain disability impacted his functional ability and/or ability to work.  However, the examiner opined it was impossible to determine or quantify without speculating whether pain, weakness, fatigability, lack of endurance, or incoordination limited his functional ability during a flare up or with repeated use over time.  Lumbar strains were not a cause of the future development of disc degeneration and arthritis was not the cause of the Veteran's radiculopathy.  Consequently, flare ups, functional loss, and occupational effect could not be assessed due to a comorbid non-service-connected condition.  

An October 2017 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with a L4-L5/L5-S1 radiculopathy.  The Veteran reported having intermittent numbness of both lower extremities typically occurring daily and lasting one to two hours.  He also reported constant pain in both lower extremities in posteromedial aspects of both legs.  The VA examiner opined the Veteran's peripheral nerve condition and/or peripheral neuropathy impacted his ability to work.  The Veteran reported being unable to walk, sit, or stand for long periods of time.

A December 2018 VA examination addendum noted the Veteran was granted service connection for a lumbar strain in 1987 and had many subsequent examinations for the lumbar strain.  An August 2014 VA examination listed degenerative arthritis of the spine as the entered diagnosis.  Although the Veteran did have age related degenerative disc disease at that time it was unrelated to the remote lumbar strain as a lumbar strain does not cause future lumbar degenerative disc disease of spondylosis.  The examiner was unable to locate any medical opinions contradicting this.  Essentially the diagnosis of L5-S1 disc disease, from a service connection perspective, was in error.  As review of the August 2014 examination incorrectly replaced the service connection diagnosis of a lumbar strain and no medical provider gave an opinion linking the lumbar degenerative disease and lower extremity radiculopathy conditions as being related to the lumbar strain.  Consequently, based on the service-connected lumbar strain the Veteran would have difficulty engaging in a physically demanding job but would be able to perform sedentary work.

Neither the October 2017 nor the December 2018 VA examiner opinions adequately explained the development of arthritis and degenerative disc disease in the lumbar spine as it related to his service-connected lumbar strain disability.  Furthermore, in October 2020 the Board remanded the Veteran's TDIU claim for a VA examination and opinion regarding functional effect of his service-connected disabilities.  The Board found the December 2018 VA opinion insufficient for purposes of properly addressing the claim because it did not address all the service-connected disabilities or address the July 2018 private opinion of Z.F.  Therefore, the October 2017 and December 2018 VA opinions were accorded little probative weight.  

In July 2018, Z.F. (M.Ed.) with CRC Services provided a vocational assessment.  The Veteran was diagnosed with lumbosacral strain residuals, bilateral lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy, and forehead scar.  The Veteran received an associate's degree in 2011 in Health Care Informatics.  He completed this degree online and he reported it required only four to six hours per week of time on the computer.  He last worked in 2004 for four months as a collections officer with Van Ru Credit Corporation, which was sedentary, skilled work.  The position required long periods of sitting which increased his low back pain and his pain affected his ability to maintain concentration and focus.  

Prior to working as a collections officer, he worked as security guard from approximately September 2001 to December 2003.  He experienced pain in his low back due to the long periods of sitting.  He stood and walked as needed when his back pain increased.  He was required to make rounds every hour.  He ultimately resigned due to increased back pain exacerbated by performing the essential duties of the job.  

During the June 2018 telephone interview with the Veteran, he reported since 2004 he spent most of the day lying down due to the combination of pain from lower back and lower extremity radiculopathy.  Sitting up increased his back pain.  He described severe difficulty sleeping due to pain and a lack of restful sleep caused fatigue resulting in daily naps for approximately three to four hours each day.  He was prescribed a back brace and cane through the VA as well as a walker for use outside of his house.  He was prescribed Hydrocodone from 2004 to 2014 and currently treated with Morphine and Celebrex.  

Per the Veteran, he had the following physical limitations: constant tingling/numbness in the bilateral lower extremities; limited reaching in all directions; maximum lift/carry of four pounds due to increased low back pain; maximum sitting 15 minutes with back brace and medications; maximum standing 10 minutes with walker or cane; maximum walking 50 feet with a cane; avoids bending/twisting, kneeling, stooping/squatting, climbing; and limits driving to 15 minutes.  The Veteran denied bathing daily due to low back pain and radiculopathy.  He used a shower chair and had help from his wife.  He had difficulty dressing independently and wore comfortable clothes as well as shoes he does not have to tie.  His wife performed all household chores due to his difficulty standing and walking.  His wife performed the grocery shopping, cooking, and did the laundry.  He could perform limited grocery shopping if it was for one item and could prepare microwavable meals.  

Z.F. opined considering the medical records from multiple service providers and the Veteran's self-report as it related to limitations from his service-connected lumbosacral strain residuals and radiculopathy of bilateral lower extremities, it was at least as likely as not, the Veteran was unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment since he last worked in 2004.  His symptoms included but were not limited to severe limitations in sitting, standing, and walking; severe limitations in maintaining concentration and focus; and a need for frequent unscheduled breaks to lie down for excessive amounts of time. 

His significant back pain impacted his ability to concentrate and focus as well as caused difficulty sleeping causing him daily fatigue.  The amount of time spent napping would not be tolerated by employers.  His bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy prevented him from working at substantially gainful activity levels.  Lumbosacral strain and radiculopathy required the Veteran take unscheduled breaks after he sat for a maximum of 15 minutes to lay down for a few hours to rest.  He reported missing two days of work per month in his last position due to back pain, which even at the sedentary unskilled level, would not be tolerated by employers.  

Sedentary employment defined by the DOT as exerting up to 10 pounds of force occasionally and/or a negligible amount of force frequently to lift, carry, push, pull, or otherwise move objects.  Sedentary work involves sitting most of the time but brief periods of walking or standing.  Based on the above reported symptoms, Z.F. opined the Veteran would be unable to meet the physical requirements of sedentary work due to the excessive need for unscheduled breaks to nap three to four hours and inability to sit for more than 15 minutes requiring an unreasonable amount of time to lay down for a few hours to relieve pian from his lower back.  Significant limitations in his ability to stand or ambulate requiring the use of a cane for short distances inside the home and a walker outside of the home.  Z.F.'s July 2018 opinion was probative evidence, as it relied on sufficient facts and data, and provided a rationale for the opinion.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993).     

As noted above, in October 2020 the Board remanded the Veteran's TDIU claim for a VA examination and opinion regarding functional effect of his service-connected disabilities.  The Board found the December 2018 VA opinion insufficient for purposes of properly addressing the claim because it did not address all the service-connected disabilities or address the July 2018 private opinion of Z.F.  In January 2022, the Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination regarding his TDIU claim.  The Veteran did not attend the scheduled examination.  

A February 2022 subsequent development letter noted attempts to reach him regarding the missed examination and requested a response within 30 days, however, the record indicated no response was timely received.  The Veteran's January 2023 supplemental claim for TDIU included a statement regarding his failure to attend the scheduled VA examination.  As discussed in detail above, he reported the development of health issues for both he and wife as well as a fear of attending VA examinations due to immobilizing pain the next day.  Despite his inability to attend in-person examinations between 2020 and 2022, he expressed a willingness to attend telehealth appointments going forward. 

In February 2023 and March 2023, the Veteran was scheduled for VA examinations related to his lumbosacral strain residuals and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy conditions.  These did not appear to be telehealth appointments as previously requested by the Veteran and he failed to attend the scheduled appointments.  However, in February 2024, the Veteran through his representative waived his right to further development and asked the Board to promulgate a decision on the evidence of record.      

In 2019, the Court, issued Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019).  Ray held that "substantially gainful employment," in the TDIU context, contained economic and noneconomic components.  The economic component meant "an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the United States Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person," while the noneconomic component required consideration of a veteran's ability to secure or follow that type of employment.  The Court also provided guidance as to the meaning of a veteran's ability to "secure and follow" such employment, noting that attention must be given to the veteran's occupational history, education, skills and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform occupational activities; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform occupational activities.

Regarding the economic component of Ray, it is not reasonably in dispute that the Veteran was unemployed from March 1, 2005, and at the time of the June 3, 2004, application was performing only marginal employment.  However, unemployment does not automatically allow for a TDIU.  Rather, the pertinent inquiry becomes consideration of the noneconomic factors.  The Board considered the physical ability factors noted in Ray, to include lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, reaching, and concentration.  The record showed the occasional walking and standing requirement of sedentary work was dependent on his symptoms.  Due to the excessive need for unscheduled breaks to nap three to four hours, his inability to sit for more than 15 minutes requiring an unreasonable amount of time to lay down for a few hours to relieve pain from his lower back, and his significant limitation in his ability to stand or ambulate due to the use of a cane for short distances inside the home and a walker outside of the home, his limitations would not fall within the competitive work environment.  Additionally, his conditions would interfere with his ability to maintain focus to execute a task within the required expectations.  The Veteran had attained an associate's degree and last worked as a collections officer, which fell within the sedentary physical demand level and was classified as skilled work.  While his past work was skilled in nature, his ability to maintain adequate concentration and pace would preclude him from securing and following any substantially gainful employment.

As a result, the Board found that there was an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the question of whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities prevented him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities prevented him from obtaining or retaining substantially gainful employment.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
