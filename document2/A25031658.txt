ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for mild spondylolysis, claimed as a back injury, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, his currently diagnosed bilateral hearing loss is related to his military service.

2. The Veteran's diagnosed mild spondylolysis is not shown to be causally or etiologically related to any disease, injury, or incident during service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

2. The criteria for service connection for mild spondylolysis, claimed as a back injury, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.655.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1982 to January 2004, and was honored with multiple decorations for their service, including the Air Force Achievement Medal; Air Force Commendation Medal; NCO Professional Military Education Ribbon; Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon (rifle); National Defense Service Medal; Air Force Overseas Long Tour Ribbon; Air Force Training Ribbon; Air Force Longevity Service Award; Air Force Outstanding Unit Award; Air Force Good Conduct Medal; and Meritorious Service Medal.

The matter comes before the Board on appeal from a rating decision issued in January 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §?20.301.  

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. Id.: see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran contends that his hearing loss is directly related to his hazardous noise exposure in service. In the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (frequency range 500-4000 hertz) in the September 2023 VA examination. The AOJ also favorably found that based on the Veteran's military occupational specialties (MOS) as an Air Force Instructor and Avionics he was exposed to a high probability of hazardous noise during his service. As there is no evidence that these findings are clearly and unmistakably erroneous, the Board is bound by them. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). Thus, the Board finds that the first and second elements of service connection have been met. Therefore, the only question left before the Board is whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed bilateral hearing loss is at least as likely as not related to his hazardous noise exposure in service.

At issue in this case is whether the Veteran's hearing loss is etiologically related to his service. To that end, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise. In that regard, the law is clear. Pursuant to the "benefit-of-the-doubt" rule, where there is "an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter," the Veteran shall prevail upon the issue. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

Where a veteran served for at least 90 days during a period of war or after December 31, 1946, and manifests certain chronic diseases, such as organic diseases of the nervous system, to a degree of 10 percent within one year from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  In an October 4, 1995, opinion, VA's Under Secretary for Health determined that high frequency sensorineural hearing loss is considered an organic disease of the nervous system and therefore a presumptive disability.  

Alternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  However, the use of continuity of symptoms to establish service connection is limited only to those diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) and does not apply to other disabilities which might be considered chronic from a medical standpoint.  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  

In addition to the criteria set forth above, a hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes is subject to the additional requirement of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, which provides that impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability only if at least one of the thresholds for the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; the thresholds for at least three of the frequencies are greater than 25 decibels; or speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.

In this matter, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show countless complaints of hearing loss from the Veteran throughout his service. This includes the Veterans complaint in December 1999 that working on flightlines was causing his difficult hearing; February 2001 where the Veteran stated his hearing had been declining the last 19 years; January 2002 persistent hearing problems were noted, and an examiner noted a diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss; June 2003 a complaint of hearing loss; and in September 2003 the Veteran complained that his hearing loss had increased since his last exam and his tinnitus was more pronounced. The Veteran also had over 20 audiogram readings throughout his time in service. The Veteran's STRs reflect such audiograms were taken in September 1991; June 1982; August 1982; May 1983; July 1985; February 1986; August 1987; June 1988; January 1991; May 1991; December 1991; March 1992; April 1992; March 1998; April 1999; December 1999; February 2001; December 2001; January 2002; February 2002; March 2002; February 2003; and August 2003. As there are so many audiograms within the Veterans file, the Board will only address such audiograms which are most relevant to the Veteran's claim. 

The Veteran's entrance examination, which was stamped in January 1982 but conducted in September 1991, reflected the following:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	6000

RIGHT	25	15	5	15	45	55

LEFT	15	10	0	5	5	20

Although it was noted the Veteran's initial entrance examination showed hearing loss in the right ear, such examination was not used as the baseline audiogram readings throughout the Veteran's service. The examiners in service used the Veteran's June 1982 audiogram readings as the baseline measurement for hearing threshold shifts in service, which reflected the following:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	6000

RIGHT	5	5	0	5	0	0

LEFT	5	0	0	0	5	10

The Veteran had many audiogram readings prior to his exit from service, but the most significant audiograms that show the most threshold shifts are from May 1983; February 1986; December 1991; March 1992; March 1998; December 1999; February 2001; December 2001; and January 2002. The May 1983 audiogram readings reflected the following:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	6000

The Veteran's last two audiogram readings were done in February 2003 and August 2003, prior to the Veterans separation from service in January 2004. The February 2003 audiogram readings reflected the following: 

			HERTZ

Based on the Veteran's STRs it is clear that both of the Veteran's ears had threshold shifts from 500 to 6000 hertz in service. The Board notes that although the Veteran has audiogram readings from September 1981, prior to service, such readings were not used as the baseline readings throughout the Veteran's service. Thus, the Board will use the June 1982 audiogram readings as his baseline readings to show threshold shifts. Throughout the Veteran's service the right ear had threshold shifts at 500 hertz and 1000 hertz from 5 to 35 decibels; at 2000 hertz from 0 to 15 decibels; at 3000 hertz from 5 to 25 decibels; at 3000 hertz from 5 to 20 decibels; at 4000 hertz from 0 to 10 decibels; and at 6000 hertz from 0 to 25 decibels. Throughout the Veteran's service the left ear had threshold shifts at 500 hertz from 5 to 35 decibels; at 1000 hertz from 0 to 30 decibels; at 2000 hertz from -5 to 15 decibels; at 3000 hertz from 0 to 15 decibels; at 4000 hertz from 5 to 25 decibels; and at 6000 hertz from 10 to 30 decibels. Thus, these shifts indicate that the Veteran had "some degree of hearing loss" in both ears during service. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).

The Veteran also had two VA examinations after service. The first examination occurred in October 2016, were the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (frequency range 500-4000 hertz) and noted while in service the Veteran's MOS of instructor/avionics caused a high probability of hazardous noise exposure in service. The examiner also noted the Veteran did not experience combat, as he served overseas in England, but was exposed to flight line, jet engines, intakes, and exhaust with and without hearing protection. The examiner also noted prior to entering service the Veteran worked for the railroad for six months, dealing with travel trailer building and assembly lines. After service, the examiner noted the Veteran worked for USPS for a year then did maintenance for the State of Missouri since 2005, mostly working sedentary jobs. However, the examiner did note the Veteran reported a history of hunting with hearing protection, riding Harley motorcycles, chronic ear infections as a kid, ear surgery as a kid where a PE tube was inserted, and that his father had to have ear surgery too, but the cause was unknown to the Veteran. 

Then the October 2016 VA examiner referred to the September 1981, June 1982, February 2003, and August 2003 audiogram readings. The examiner then stated after reviewing all hearing evaluations located in the Veteran's STRs, there was evidence of fluctuations in hearing as well as diagnoses of conductive hearing loss. However, the examiner stated that fluctuations and conductive components do not equate to permanent hearing loss. The examiner then compared the entrance examination to the last audiogram reading prior to separation, which he found were all thresholds within normal limits bilaterally, and with age corrections applied, there was no evidence of a shift in hearing in either ear. Although the examiner does not deny exposure to noise, he does deny that the exposure resulted in hearing loss that meets criteria for service connection. Additionally, the examiner found when evaluating the Veteran's current degree of hearing loss, one cannot rule out contributions from his civilian occupation and the aging process. The examiner referred to the Institute of Medicine (2005) concluded that based on current knowledge of cochlear physiology there is insufficient scientific evidence for delayed-onset hearing loss secondary to military noise exposure, as hearing loss should occur at the time of the exposure. The examiner found that there was not sufficient evidence from longitudinal studies to determine whether permanent noise induced hearing loss can develop long after cessation of noise exposure. The examiner noted based on the available anatomical and physiologic evidence, there was no suggestion that delayed post-exposure noise induced hearing loss was likely. The examiner found that when hearing is normal on discharge, there is no permanent significant threshold shift greater than normal progression and test re-test variability during military service, then there is no basis on which to conclude that a current hearing loss is causally related to military service, including noise exposure. Thus, the examiner opined there was no nexus between any current hearing loss and military service, regardless of the cause of the hearing loss.

The Veteran had another VA examination in September 2023, where the examiner confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (frequency range 500-4000 hertz). The examiner noted the Veteran's high probability of hazardous noise exposure due to his MOS. The examiner also found that the Veteran's entrance exam in September 1981 the Veteran had moderate hearing loss at 4000 and 6000 hertz in the right ear, but normal hearing for the left ear. The examiner also noted that normal hearing bilaterally in the August 2003 discharge exam, with no permanent auditory damage due to exposure to hazardous noise in service. The VA examiner noted that in May 2019 the Veteran had normal hearing in the right ear, but not the left ear. The examiner found that although noise exposure was conceded and the relationship of noise, auditory damage and hearing loss was well-established, auditory damage and hearing loss are not conceded based on noise alone. Thus, there must be a nexus of auditory damage to relate current hearing loss to military noise and not another etiology. Therefore, the examiner opined the evidence was against a nexus in this case, as such it was less likely than not that the hearing loss was related to military noise exposure. Additionally, the examiner found for the right ear, hearing loss clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service and was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated beyond its natural progression by an in-service injury, event, or illness based on the discharge exam. The examiner also found that although the Veteran has suffered from toxic risk exposure activities in service, a nexus could not be established as the claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activities, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. 

The Board notes that certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

As such, the Board finds that both the October 2016 and September 2023 VA examinations are inadequate, because the examiners concluded there were no significant changes or hearing loss in service, even though there were clear bilateral hearing threshold shifts throughout multiple audiogram readings and multiple complaints of worsening of hearing in the Veteran's STRs, plus lay statements noting continued struggles with hearing loss after service. Further, it is clear that the Veteran had hazardous noise exposure in service and threshold shifts in service in both of his ears. Thus, giving the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record persuasively shows that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss had its onset during service. Accordingly, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted. 38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38 C.R.F. §?3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?49, 53 (1990).

2. Entitlement to service connection for mild spondylolysis, claimed as a back injury.

In this matter, the Veteran contends that his diagnosed mild spondylolysis, claimed as a back injury, was the result of his back injury he suffered in service when playing golf. In the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran was diagnosed with mild spondylosis in July 2015. The AOJ also favorably found that the Veteran's STRs showed complaints of a back pain in January 1993. As there is no evidence that these findings are clearly and unmistakably erroneous, the Board is bound by them. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). Thus, the Board finds that the first and second elements of service connection have been met. Therefore, the only question left before the Board is whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed mild spondylosis is at least as likely as not related to his back pain in service.

The Veteran had a VA examination in August 2016 regarding his back condition, where the VA examiner noted the Veteran had been diagnosed with mild spondylolysis in his July 2015 medical records. The examiner noted the Veteran hurt himself at Dyess Air Force Base and in service while playing golf in the 1990s, straining his back. The Veteran at the time was evaluated and treated conservatively, with it improving over time as it was not noted further in the Veteran's STRs. However, the examiner noted since discharge in 2004 the Veteran had mostly worked in sedentary positions. The examiner noted that his medical records from May 2013 to January 2015 did not describe back pain. The Veteran however described his current condition as lower back pain, typically lasting for about one day. As such the examiner found that the Veteran's STRs only reflected a single incident of back pain during service and that the physical exam on that day did not show either pain with movement or a significant limitation of range of motion. Thus, the examiner opined the chronic lumbar spine condition is less likely than not to have developed during military service.

Additionally, the Board notes the Veteran does have medical records regarding his back pain since the August 2016 VA examination. Although the Veteran did seek medical services for his back pain, there is nothing within the medical records that would assist with his claim for service connection at this time. 

Based on the aforementioned, the Board finds the August 2016 VA examiner adequately concluded that the Veteran's current diagnosis of mild spondylolysis is not related to his service, as the examiner specifically addressed the complaints of back pain in service and the symptoms the Veteran is currently experiencing being based on the Veterans current circumstances. Thus, the Board finds the August 2016 VA examiner provided adequate rationale for the conclusions reached and addressed the specifics of the Veteran's case thereof. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).

For the foregoing reasons, service connection for mild spondylolysis, claimed as a back injury, is not warranted. In reaching such determination, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, the probative evidence is not in approximate balance and weighs against the Veteran's claim. Thus, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable in such regard, and his service connection claim must be denied. 38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38 C.F.R. §?3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?49, 53 (1990).
