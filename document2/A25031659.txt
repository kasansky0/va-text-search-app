ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1980 to June 1986.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) under the modernized review system, or Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

In June 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2024 decision. In July 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2024 decision. The Veteran filed a timely appeal to this rating decision on a VA Form 10182 in August 2024. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran asserts his right ear hearing loss is related to his military service. Specifically, the Veteran contends he had a problem with his hearing while flying in the Navy and that he was treated for hearing problems while in the Navy. See August 2024 Statement in Support of Claim.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Where a Veteran served 90 days or more during a period of war or during peacetime service after December 31, 1946, and a chronic disease, including hearing loss, becomes manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in or aggravated by service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. If a condition listed as a chronic disease in § 3.309(a) is noted during service, but is either shown not to be chronic or the diagnosis could be legitimately questioned, then a showing of continuity of related symptomatology after discharge is required to support the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding that the continuity of symptomatology provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) only apply to a chronic disease listed in § 3.309(a)).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When a Veteran seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the Veteran prevails. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In the July 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable findings that the Veteran has a current right ear hearing loss disability and that in-service noise exposure is conceded based on the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS). The Board is bound by these favorable findings.

Therefore, the remaining question before the Board is if the Veteran's right ear hearing loss is etiologically related to his in-service noise exposure.

The Veteran had normal hearing at his enlistment examination in August 1979. The Veteran was provided a reference audiogram in November 1984. At the time, he had normal hearing in his right ear. See Service Treatment Records Volume 1 and Volume 2.

The Veteran was provided a VA audiological examination in 1999. The Veteran's hearing in his right ear was normal for VA compensation purposes. See September 1999 Compensation and Pension Exam Report.

A review of the Veteran's medical records show he was seen by an audiologist in December 2013. A hearing test at the time showed normal hearing in the right ear from 250-8000 Hz. See VA Medical Records p. 737.

The Veteran was provided a VA audiological examination in August 2015. The Veteran's hearing in his right ear was normal for VA compensation purposes. The Veteran did have hearing loss in the frequencies of 6000 Hz and 8000 Hz; however, those frequencies do not constitute hearing loss for VA compensation purposes. Even though there was not compensable hearing loss, the examiner provided a nexus opinion. The examiner opined that the Veteran's hearing loss was less likely than not caused by or a result of an event in military service because the latest exam in the military records was from August 1984 and revealed normal hearing bilaterally with no shift compared to entrance. The examiner noted that there was no mention of hearing problems during service. See August 2015 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

The Veteran was provided a VA audiological examination in August 2018. The Veteran was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in his right ear. The examiner opined that the Veteran's hearing loss was less likely than not caused by or a result of an event in military service because the Veteran had normal hearing on his entrance examination in August 1979, his reenlistment examination in August 1984, and his compensation examination in September 1999. See August 2018 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

The Veteran was provided a VA audiological examination in May 2021. The Veteran's hearing in his right ear was normal for VA compensation purposes. Even though there was not compensable hearing loss, the examiner provided a nexus opinion. The examiner opined that the Veteran's hearing loss was less likely than not caused by or a result of an event in military service because the Veteran's hearing was normal on his in-service hearing exam in 1984 and on his VA compensation examination in 1999. See May 2021 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

The Veteran was provided a VA audiological examination in April 2024. The Veteran's right ear hearing was normal for VA compensation purposes. See April 2024 Audiological Evaluation.

The Veteran was provided a VA audiological examination in May 2024. The examiner opined that the Veteran's hearing loss was less likely than not caused by or a result of an event in military service because the only diagnosis of a ratable hearing loss was noted in 2018. The examiner noted that the hearing exam in 2018 had bone scores that did not meet the criteria for a ratable hearing loss and that there was a 5-10 dB air bone gap in 500-4000 Hz. He explained that was consistent with a mild middle ear component, not a noise induced hearing loss. This was further substantiated with a return to normal hearing thresholds, using current VA criteria, on future hearing exams. No other hearing exams revealed a hearing loss, using current VA criteria. The examiner went through the record and noted that the September 1986 VA examination noted no hearing loss, the April 1994 VA examination noted that there were no complaints with regard to hearing, and the September 1999 VA examination showed normal hearing except at the 3000 Hz level; however, the 3000 Hz level was 25 dB which is still within normal limits using current VA criteria. See May 2024 Medical Opinion Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

The only evidence suggesting a nexus between the Veteran's hearing loss and service is the statement from the Veteran himself. The Veteran is competent to testify as to a condition within his knowledge and personal observation. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308-310 (2007). However, he is not competent to diagnose such disability or render a nexus, as it requires specialized medical knowledge and specific testing. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (stating that competent medical evidence means evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions). Therefore, the Veteran's statements regarding the nexus between his hearing loss and his service are lacking in probative value.

For the reasons provided above, the Board finds the probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding the Veteran's right ear hearing loss began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease. Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is not warranted, and the appeal is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
