ORDER

A compensable evaluation for sinusitis is denied.

Service connection for bilateral hip disabilities is denied.

Service connection for bilateral shoulder disabilities is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's sinusitis did not manifest in one or two incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or: three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting.

2. The persuasive evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran's bilateral hip disabilities had their onset during active service or are etiologically related to his active-duty service.

3. The persuasive evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran's bilateral shoulder disabilities had their onset during active service or are etiologically related to his active-duty service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable rating for sinusitis have not been met or approximated. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.31, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6513.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hip disabilities have not been met or approximated. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral shoulder disabilities have not been met or approximated. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from July 2, 1984 to December 7, 1984, from December 1, 1990 to May 15, 1991 and from May 29, 1991 to October 7, 1996. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an October 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision that considered the evidence of record on that date.

In May 2024 the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request (Notice of Disagreement) to the Board and selected the Direct Review option by a Veterans Law Judge, listing the issues on appeal as relating to claims for sinusitis, bilateral hip and bilateral shoulder disabilities. While the Board recognizes that the Veteran listed the date of the decision on appeal as May 23, 2024, the Board notes that no rating decision was issued on this date. Instead, this is the date of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to compensation for the above-mentioned disabilities. Further, the Board notes that the rating decision issued in relation to that claim, and the only rating decision at this time which addresses these specific disabilities, was issued in October 2023. Therefore, the Board will construe the May 2024 VA Form 10182 as an appeal of that decision.

As the Veteran selected the direct review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Increased Ratings - General     

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.     

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § § 4.7. All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. §5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § § 4.3.

1. A compensable evaluation for sinusitis is denied. 

The Veteran asserts entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for his service-connected sinusitis.

The Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for sinusitis in the October 2023 rating decision, rated as noncompensable effective May 24, 2023.

The Veteran's sinusitis is rated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 6513. That code instructs the rating official to rate the disorder under the General Rating Formula for Sinusitis. Under the general rating formula (located under DC 6514), a noncompensable (0 percent) disability rating is warranted when sinusitis is detected by X-ray only. A 10 percent rating is warranted for sinusitis manifested by one or two incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment. An incapacitating episode of sinusitis is specifically defined in the regulations as one requiring bed rest and treatment by a physician. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97. A 10 percent rating is also warranted for sinusitis manifested by three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. "Purulent" is defined as pertaining to or consisting of pus; containing pus. DORLAND'S at 1534.

The next higher rating, a 30 percent rating, is warranted for sinusitis manifested by three or more incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment. A 30 percent rating is also warranted for sinusitis manifested by more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. The next higher rating, a 50 percent rating, is warranted if the Veteran has received radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis; or near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. A 50 percent rating is the highest rating available under DC 6513.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in June 2023. The examiner diagnosed chronic sinusitis, noting that the condition was mild, and was controlled by over-the-counter nasal spray and allergy pills. The Veteran did not have any findings, signs or symptoms related to his chronic maxillary sinusitis. The Veteran experienced two non-incapacitating episodes and no incapacitating episodes in the past 12 months. The VA examiner further noted that the Veteran had not required prolonged antibiotic treatment. The VA examiner reported that the Veteran's sinusitis did not impact his ability to work.

After a review of the record, the Board concludes that a compensable disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected sinusitis is not warranted.

The evidence does not support finding the Veteran's sinusitis was manifested by incapacitating episodes during a 12-month period. An incapacitating sinusitis episode is defined as one requiring bed rest and treatment by a physician. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97. Although the record reflects lay statements reporting on the severity of his sinusitis symptomatology, none of them indicate he had required bed rest. See October 2023 VA Examination Report.

Even if the Veteran's statements indicated he observed sinusitis episodes that limited him to bed rest, the available evidence does not show he received antibiotic treatment lasting four to six weeks. See October 2023 VA Examination Report.

In this case, the evidence weighs against finding the Veteran's service-connected sinusitis disability manifested with symptomatology that meets the criteria DC 6513 requires for a compensable rating. He has not described sinusitis episodes that are incapacitating and require prolonged antibiotic treatment. Neither does the record show three to six non-incapacitating sinusitis episodes characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting.

Because the frequency, duration, severity, of the Veteran's sinusitis disability does not meet the criteria for a 10 percent rating, consideration of a greater than 10 percent rating is not warranted. Accordingly, the Board finds the assignment of a compensable rating is not warranted at any time across the appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DCs 6513.

Service Connection- General 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § § 3.303(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § § 3.303(d). 

Service connection may be granted on a direct basis as a result of disease or injury incurred in service based on nexus using a three-element test: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a), (d); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

2. Service connection for bilateral hip disabilities is denied.

AND

3. Service connection for bilateral shoulder disabilities is denied. 

The Veteran is claiming service connection for bilateral hip and shoulder disabilities, claiming that these conditions are related to his active-duty service. While the Veteran wrote in his May 2024 VA Form 10182 that he believed that these conditions were related to his service in the Gulf, he did not reference any specific event or injury which he believes caused these disabilities. 

Initially, the Board notes that the October 2023 rating decision includes favorable findings that the Veteran has been diagnosed with bilateral hip strains and bilateral hip shoulder strains. Thus, the Board is bound by these favorable findings, and the Veteran meets the current disability requirements. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

As to the second element of direct service connection, an in-service incurrence or aggravation, the record does not show that the Veteran was diagnosed with any shoulder or hip disabilities while in-service. His service treatment records (STRs) are without diagnosis or finding that he had and shoulder or hip disability while on active duty.

The Veteran was afforded VA hip and shoulder examinations in October 2023. As it relates to the hips, the examiner diagnosed bilateral hip strain and left hip joint replacement. As to the onset of the conditions, the Veteran denied any specific hip injury. The examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the claimed hip disabilities were related to active-duty service, as there was no evidence in the service treatment records to the support the claim, and the first onset of pain in the medical records for the left and right hips were in 2021 and 2023, respectively.

As it relates to the claimed shoulder disabilities, the October 2023 VA examiner diagnosed bilateral shoulder strain and bilateral shoulder arthroscopy. As to onset, the Veteran reported that day to day activities lead to his current shoulder condition. The examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the claimed disabilities were related to active-duty service as there was no evidence in the service treatment records to support the claim, and the first onset of shoulder pain in the medical records was 2009.

Upon review of the record, there is no evidence of an in-service injury, event, or disease of the left or right shoulder or left or right hip. As such, the persuasive evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran's bilateral shoulder or bilateral hip disabilities are etiologically related to his active-duty service on a direct basis. There is no evidence which supports a finding that the Veteran had an in-service occurrence or injury which is related to his shoulders or hips, or that there is a causal relationship between the Veteran's bilateral shoulder and/or bilateral hips and his active-duty service. The second and third elements of service connection are not met, and thus, service connection must be denied.

Accordingly, as the persuasive evidence of record is against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application, and the claims must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
