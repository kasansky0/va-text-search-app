REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from September 1967 to October 1969.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 higher-level review rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held in October 2024.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 and July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review in the January 2024 on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the October 31, 2024, hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the April 2023 and July 2023 decisions decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review, and prior to the October 2024 Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Procedural History

Details of the procedural history of this appeal are of assistance in determining the effective date for the Veteran's claims on appeal.

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for Parkinson's Disease in the Legacy Appeals system in June 2011.  However, in January 2012 the Veteran withdrew the June 2011 claim for Parkinson's Disease as part of filing a new claim focused on cold weather injury/neuropathies.

In a June 2012 rating decision, the Veteran was sent a notification that his January 2012 claims for service connection for cold weather injuries, bilateral upper and lower extremities, as well as peripheral neuropathy, bilateral upper and lower extremities, were denied.

The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement in March 2013. VA issued an April 2017 Statement of the Case (SOC), however, the Veteran did not follow-up within 60 days by filing a substantive appeal to continue pursuit of the claim. As such, the decision became final. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.20, 19.22. Once a decision is final, the finalized claim cannot be reopened until a new claim is filed. If a new claim filed and subsequently granted, the effective date of the grant is the date from which the current appeal stems, the new claim, and not the claim that was finalized. 

The Veteran did file a new claim for service connection of Parkinson's Disease in July 2012. In an August 2013 rating decision, the Veteran was sent a notification that his July 2012 claim for Parkinson's disease was denied. As VA did not receive a notice of disagreement or new and material evidence within one year of the notification, the rating decision was finalized.  38 U.S.C. § § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156.  As noted above, any subsequent grant of a new claim will be effective as of the date of the new claim once a prior claim has finalized. 

On May 10, 2018, the Veteran filed a new claim to reopen the claim for neuropathy and for Parkinson's based on the submission of new and material evidence.

In a September 2018 rating decision, as the RO found that new and material evidence had not been submitted, the claim for Parkinson's Disease and peripheral neuropathy were not reopened. In October 2018, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement along with his and his wife's Affidavits regarding his exposure to Agent Orange on the rifle range in Munsan, Korea, as well as a positive etiologic opinion regarding the relationship between the Veteran's service and his Parkinson's disease.

After an April 2020 SOC was issued, the Veteran timely withdrew his Legacy appeal opting into the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system with the filing an appeal in a June 2020 VA Form 10182.  Once in the AMA system, if the Veteran continuously pursues his claim filing timely Supplemental Claims, Higher-Level Review, or Appeals, the effective date of any claim granted reflects back to the date of the claim, in this instance, May 10, 2018. 

In a May 2021 Board decision, the Board found that readjudication of the Veteran's claims for Parkinson's disease and peripheral neuropathies was warranted and remanded the claims for further development. In a June 2022 the claims for Parkinson's Disease and peripheral neuropathies were denied.  In September 2022, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim for service connection for Parkinson's Disease and peripheral neuropathies. In an April 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for Parkinson's Disease and its residuals effective as of August 10, 2022, the date of enactment of the PACT Act.  In a July 2023 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to TDIU and DEA also effective from August 10, 2022.  

In September 2023 the Veteran requested Higher-Level Review of the effective date established in the April and July 2023 rating decision for Parkinson's and its residuals as well as TDIU and DEA.  In the January 2024 rating decision on appeal earlier effective dates were denied.   

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 10, 2018, but no earlier, for service connection for Parkinson's disease, bradykinesia, right upper extremity with tremors and muscle rigidity, is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 10, 2018, but no earlier, for service connection for bradykinesia, left upper extremity, with tremors and muscle rigidity, is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 10, 2018, but no earlier, for service connection for bradykinesia, left lower extremity, with tremors and muscle rigidity, is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 10, 2018, but no earlier, for service connection for bradykinesia, right lower extremity, with tremors and muscle rigidity, is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 10, 2018, but no earlier, for service connection for urinary incontinence is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 10, 2018, but no earlier, for service connection for balance impairment is granted.  

The Veteran contends that an effective date of July 2, 2012, for the grant of service connection for his Parkinson's disease with bilateral upper extremity bradykinesia, bilateral lower extremity bradykinesia, urinary incontinence, and balance impairment is warranted because he met the criteria for service connection on a direct basis for Parkinson's disease and its residuals since July 2, 2012. See October 2024 Hearing Transcript.

The Veteran further contends that an earlier effective date should have been granted on a direct, facts-found basis rather than presumptively under the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), which in turn would have led to an earlier effective date. PACT Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022).

Initially, the Board acknowledges the enactment of Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022), which expands and extends eligibility of presumptive service connection. This includes presuming herbicide agent exposure to Veterans who served in the Republican of Vietnam, any U.S. or Royal Thai military bases in Thailand, or near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) in Korea. Claims granted under the PACT Act are effective no earlier than August 10, 2022. As will be explained below, the Board has determined on a facts-found basis that the Veteran experienced cumulative exposure to TCE and other solvents which caused or contributed to his Parkinson's disease, as such, an earlier effective date on a direct facts-found basis for his claims is warranted.

The Veteran has consistently provided details over many years claiming exposure to Agent Orange in three locations: at the North Star Rifle Range in Korea at various times, a week on the Korean demilitarized zone, and at Fort Gordon during Military Police (MP) training. See e.g., May 2012 VA Examination, October 2024 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. The Veteran's military occupational specialty during his service was Military Police. As an MP security patrol dog handler with the 38th Brigade at the North Star Rifle Range, he contends that he witnessed the spraying of herbicides, soldiers carrying buckets of herbicides past him, and dying foliage in the area sprayed. The Veteran testified that he was patrolling within 10 to 15 yards of the DMZ with security dogs on 6-foot and 60-foot leashes to deter North Koreans from scavenging munitions from the North Star Rifle Range. See pg. 9 January 2021 Hearing Transcript.

The Board notes that the Veteran indicated in a May 2012 VA Peripheral Nerve Examination that he was reassigned from the Republic of Vietnam to Korea after two days because his brother was assigned to the Republic of Vietnam. In November 2018 a private physician, Dr. S. N., offered his opinion that based upon his examination and the Veteran's complaints in 1968 and 1969 of mild weakness and decreased sensation of the C4-C7 nerves bilaterally that the Veteran's neurological disorder was related to service. In April 2021, a private physician, Dr W.F. offered his opinion that the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy/Parkinson's Disease was caused by his exposure to Agent Orange. 

In August 2022, the Veteran submitted a comprehensive medical opinion from a private physician, Dr. M. S-S. Dr. M. S-S. reviewed service treatment records, and VA treatment records, performed a physical examination, and interviewed the Veteran before confirming the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and concluded that it is more likely than not (51 percent certainty or more) that his diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was due to/caused by/or related to secondary to TCE and other cleaning solvents. As rationale, the physician noted that the Veteran was exposed to TCE and other cleaning solvents in-service while performing daily cleaning his pistol as military police. Research has shown that TCE-induced Parkinsonism is caused by pathological and neurochemical changes in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. As further support of her conclusion, Dr. M. S-S. cited several articles on research in medical journals including Solvent Exposures and Parkinson's Disease risk in Twins, Annals of Neurology; and Peripheral Neuropathies Associated with Drugs and Toxins, Pain and Neuromuscular Rehabilitation Knowledge, Sept 2015. 

In February 2023 VA issued a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum indicating that there was evidence of non-deployment related exposures based on lead and solvent exposures based on the Veteran's marksmanship award on his DD-214. 

The Veteran underwent a VA Parkinson's Disease Examination in March 2023.  The examiner that the Veterans Parkinson's Disease was at least as likely as not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activities after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. As rationale, the examiner noted the Veteran's participation in TERA as he was exposed to lead, solvents, and Agent Orange per the TERA memorandum which contributed to the Veteran's Parkinson's Disease.  

The Board notes that while the RO was able to confirm locations of the Veteran's service in Korea (see October 2024 correspondence), it was unable to confirm exposure to Agent Orange. Further, the RO verified that the use of Agent Orange at Fort Gordon was discontinued in October 1967; while the Veteran's MP training began shortly thereafter on November 2, 1967. See August 2017 RO emails to and from Agent Orange/VBA Compensation Service.

After a thorough review and consideration of the evidence, the Board determines that it is plausible that the Veteran's brief time in Vietnam, MP duties in Korea, and training at Fort Gordon exposed him to Agent Orange. The Board finds the Veteran's numerous statements and each Board Hearing testimony to be credible regarding his recollection of his service and instances of Agent Orange exposure. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 38 (2007). In addition, the evidence indicates that the Veteran was exposed to TCE and other gun cleaning solvents which are known to cause neurologic disorders including Parkinson's disease. 

Based upon the evidence of record, and resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, as May 10, 2018, is the date of the new claim for Parkinson's disease which was continuously pursued from the date of the claim without the claim being finalized, the Board finds that an effective date of May 10, 2018, but no earlier, is warranted for the grant of direct service connection for Parkinson's Disease with right and left upper extremity bradykinesia with tremor, and muscle rigidity, right and left lower extremity bradykinesia, with tremor, and muscle rigidity, urinary incontinence and balance impairment. Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for award of a TDIU rating to July 2, 2012. His TDIU rating is effective August 10, 2022. Further, he contends that the residual symptoms of his Parkinson's Disease have existed since at least October 2006 at a level disabling him from employment. See pg. 3 October 2024 Hearing Testimony. 

Total disability is considered to exist when there is any impairment that is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(1). 

A total disability rating for compensation purposes may be assigned on the basis of "individual unemployability," or when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. In such an instance, if there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability must bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

It is undisputed that the Veteran met the schedular criteria for a TDIU rating effective August 10, 2022. Effective August 10, 2022, the Veteran has a combined disability rating of 90 percent with Parkinson's Disease for right upper extremity bradykinesia with tremors and muscle rigidity at 40 percent.  In light of the earlier effective dates granted above that 90 percent combined disability rating is now effective May 10, 2018.  

Next, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise that the Veteran has been unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation since October 31, 2006.

Social Security Disability records indicate that the onset of the Veteran's disability was October 31, 2006, and his initial entitlement date was April 2007. The records include a neurology evaluation in February 2007 in which it was noted that the Veteran had marked limitation of fine and gross motor manipulation of bilateral upper extremities. He was limited to standing for 30 minutes at a time and walking up to a block at a time. He could not perform any lifting, carrying, pushing, or pulling activities. 

In July 2013 a VA physiatrist examiner concluded that the Veteran's Parkinson's disease impacted his ability to work. He noted that the Veteran had worked as a respiratory therapist for 39 years until his bradykinesia and balance issues with rigidity prevented him from performing physical activities at any level. He further noted that the Veteran's upper extremity rigidity and tremors posed significant limitations on sedentary activities. The Veteran advised that his hand tremors precluded him from performing intubations.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-8940 in May 2018 in which he stated that his last day of employment due to the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease was October 16, 2006.  He submitted a lay statement in November 2018 in which he noted rigidity of muscles, memory and cognition deficits, a walker prescribed by VA for mobility at home and a scooter for outside the home, inability to speak clearly, and freezing of his lower limbs 5 days out of 7 in which he was to wait to move or crawl to a chair or his scooter. 

Accordingly, based upon the foregoing, the Board concludes that TDIU from May 10, 2018, is warranted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.16.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility for DEA

With respect to the Veteran's claim seeking an earlier effective date for the grant of DEA, the Board finds that an effective date of May 10, 2018, is warranted for the grant of DEA.

With certain exceptions, effective dates relating to awards under Chapter 35 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5113.

In the case of a veteran who is alive, the conditions for basic eligibility for DEA include: (1) the veteran's discharge from service under conditions other than dishonorable; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a). Total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. Total disability may or may not be permanent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a). Permanence of disability will be taken to exist when such impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(b). The term "total disability permanent in nature" for the purpose of DEA means any disability rated total for the purposes of disability compensation which is based on impairment reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person. 38 U.S.C. § 3501(a)(7).

The Board has now awarded TDIU from May 10, 2018, and an earlier effective date for the Veteran's Parkinson's disease and its service-connected residuals. There is no suggestion that the Veteran's Parkinson's disease is anything but permanent and total in nature. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.15 (permanent total disability shall be taken to exist when the impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person). Therefore, DEA are awarded from May 10, 2018, the date on which entitlement to a TDIU has been granted in this decision.
