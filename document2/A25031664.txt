ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of November 7, 1981, for the award of service connection for tinnitus is granted.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A March 1982 rating decision awarded service connection for right ear otitis media and denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss; a March 1983 rating decision, awarded service connection for right ear hearing loss and denied an increased rating for right ear otitis media without any mention of tinnitus. The decisions became final in March 1984.

2. Service treatment records document complaints of tinnitus in conjunction with the otitis. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of November 7, 1981, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.102, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1977 to November 1981.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 23, 2020, for the award of service connection for tinnitus to include on the basis of a CUE.  

The Veteran contended that he should be granted an effective date prior to October 23, 2020, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus.  More specifically, the Veteran and his representative argued that the Veteran's tinnitus was originally claimed in 1982, just after he separated from service.  The representative noted that on a December 12, 1982, VA Form 21-2545 Report of Medical Examination for Disability Evaluation, the present complaint was listed as, "Loosing hearing and directional hearing in right ear.  Constant Ringing in Right EAR" and the Veteran also had medical documentation from September 1982 (10 months after separation) showing he experienced hearing loss and tinnitus in the right ear.  Therefore, the Veteran argues his tinnitus should be service-connected since 1982 due to a CUE.  See July 2023 VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application and accompanying statement.  

In correspondence accompanying the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran's representative argued that the Veteran disagreed with the July 2023 determination denying an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for his tinnitus.  The Veteran believed that a CUE was made in the March 25, 1982, rating decision and from the September 28, 1982, increased rating claim for otitis media right ear and service connection for hearing loss (which was adjudicated in a March 4, 1983, rating decision).  The representative explained that the September 27, 1982, claim was for otitis media and post-op residuals. The representative alleged that the right ear hearing loss and constant ringing in the right ear noted on VA Form 21-2545, dated December 12, 1982, were residuals of the Veteran's service-connected otitis media, post-operative, as well as his right ear hearing loss based on the (September) 1982 claim.  A claim for the increase for the otitis media post-operative should have included any scarring and ringing in the ears as it was listed on the 21-2545.  The representative stated that while this was not an inferred claim, the VA did a disservice to the Veteran back in 1983, when it did not account for the clearly identify ringing in the ears, which should have been rated as a residual on its own.   

In general, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection, shall be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

A decision of the RO becomes final if the appellant does not express disagreement or submit new and material evidence within one year. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(a), 3.105(b), 3.156(b), 3.160(d), 20.302. Once a decision of the RO becomes final, the decision can be reversed or amended only when evidence establishes clear and unmistakable error (CUE) was made in the adjudication. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a). CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error." It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE. Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error." Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993). In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different. Id. at 44.

Where evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a). For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision. Id.

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated"; and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time that decision was rendered. Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992).

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision. See Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233, 235-36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999). A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset. King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014). The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different. Id. at 442.

At the time of the prior rating decisions, the VA recognized formal and informal claims. A formal claim is one that has been filed on a form prescribed by VA. See 38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (a). An informal claim may be any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under VA law. See Thomas v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 197 (2002); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.155(a) (2014). An informal claim must be written, see Rodriguez v. West, 189 F. 3d. 1351 (Fed. Cir. 1999), and it must identify the benefit being sought. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-5 (1998). Moreover, the mere presence of medical evidence does not establish an intent to seek service connection. See Brannon, supra (holding that the mere receipt of medical records could not be construed as an informal claim); see also Criswell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 501, 503 (2006). The regulations permitting informal claims were eliminated as of March 24, 2015, and formal claims were required from that point forward. 

Whether formal or informal, the essential requirements of a claim include: "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) communication in writing." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009). A veteran's claim must identify the sickness, disease, or injuries for which compensation is sought, at least at a high level of generality. Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2020). VA is required to sympathetically read all claimant filings to determine all potential claims reasonably raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations. Moody v. Principi, 360 F.3d 1306, 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

For informal claims, "[t]he 'sympathetic reading' requirement does not obligate the Board to conduct an exercise in prognostication, but only requires that it consider all claims reasonably raised by the evidence." Brokowski, 23 Vet. App. at 88.

Here, in November 1981, the Veteran submitted a claim for advanced otitis in the right ear and eustachian tube blockage. A March 1982 rating decision awarded service connection for otitis media in the right ear with eustachian tube blockage and assigned a noncompensable rating from November 7, 1981.  At the same time, service connection was denied for bilateral hearing loss since his hearing was normal on the VA audiogram. 

Prior to the March 1982 decision becoming final, on September 27, 1982, the Veteran sought a re-evaluation for his service-connected right ear condition noting that he underwent surgery in March 1982, which also resulted in hearing loss.  In conjunction with his claim, the Veteran submitted VA treatment records dated from January to September 1982 indicating that he had chronic otitis media.  X-rays taken in January 1982 showed that there was partial opacification consistent with mastoiditis on the right side.  In February 1982, he had complaints of tinnitus in his right ear.  He subsequently underwent a tympanomastoidectomy in the right ear with canal wall up.  He had complaints of intermittent drainage.  In April 1982, he no longer had otorrhea, but still had tinnitus and hearing loss.  The assessment was that he was still healing status post tympanomastoidectomy.  A July 1982 audiogram showed mild-moderate conductive hearing loss on the right side and a treatment record noted ringing in the right ear.  In September 1982, his ear looked good, dry, and clean.  

On VA Form 21-2545, Report of Medical Examination for Disability Evaluation, dated December 12, 1982, the Veteran noted complaints of losing hearing and directional hearing in his right ear and constant ringing in his right ear.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA ENT examination on December 13, 1982.  The examiner noted that there were no complaints at the time of the examination.  After an audiogram, the Veteran was diagnosed with right ear conductive hearing loss.  

In a Memorandum, dated in January 1983, Dr. K.P. noted that the Veteran's service treatment records documented repeated treatment in the military for allergic rhinitis, recurrent external otitis, and otitis media in the right ear.  Although the Veteran underwent a right tympanomastoidectomy in February 1982, it appeared that the operation did not completely control his infection and he had at first a small perforation in the graft, intermitted discharge, and some lateralization of the graft.  The infection subsided after continued treatment, but he had a degree of conductive hearing loss that was greater than before his operation.  A revision surgery would likely restore his hearing. 

In a March 1983 rating decision, the noncompensable evaluation for otitis media was continued and the Veteran was awarded service connection for right ear hearing loss, effective March 26, 1982, the date of an audiogram showing decreased hearing (which was much worse than on February 26, 1982) without any mention of tinnitus.  

As an initial matter, to the extent to which the Veteran argues that there was CUE in the March 1982 and March 1982 rating decisions, the Board notes that failure to adjudicate a claim cannot rise to the level of CUE in that failure to adjudicate is not outcome determinative. See Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); cf. Crippen v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 412, 420 (1996) (where failure to reopen was not sufficient to plead CUE). There can be no CUE finding absent a final and binding decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104, see Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 419-22 (1999) (RO failure to adjudicate an informally raised claim did not constitute a final disallowance of the claim and, therefore, there was no final adverse decision subject to CUE attack).

Consequently, the Veteran's CUE motion is misplaced. Only final decisions are subject to CUE. Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2020). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has explained that its precedent establishes that "when the RO has not adjudicated claims before it, there is not a final decision on those claims and 'a CUE analysis is not required.'" Bean v. McDonough, 66 F.4 th 979 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

The question for the Board is whether there is a pending unadjudicated claim. in November 1981, the Veteran submitted a claim for otitis media in the right ear and eustachian tube blockage. Even reviewing the November 1981 filing liberally, there was nothing on the claim that indicated an intent to file a claim for tinnitus.  Significantly, there was also nothing on the claim that indicated an intent to file a claim for hearing loss, and yet the AOJ still inferred and adjudicated the claim. In this regard, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has interpreted the language of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(2) to require VA to develop and adjudicate related claims for secondary service connection for disabilities that are "reasonably raised" during the adjudication of a formally initiated claim for the "proper evaluation level for the primary service-connected disability." See Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021). In Bailey, a case involving secondary service connection for diarrhea and lower extremity lymphedema due to radiation treatment for prostate cancer, the Court determined that 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(2) required VA to "recognize, develop, and adjudicate" entitlement to secondary service connection for Bailey's diarrhea and lymphedema, "once the VA examination report raised those issues in the context of the formally initiated claim as to the proper evaluation level for service-connected prostate cancer residuals." Id. at 203.

In the present case a review of the service treatment records reflects that the Veteran had a long history of ear symptoms. He first complained of an earache in January 1978. At that time he was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection. In March 1978 the Veteran went to the ER complaining of vomiting, headache, sore throat, earache, cough, and chills. The assessment was viral URI. In September 1979 he was seen for an earache and complained that he can't hear out of right ear. Examination reflected the tympanic membrane slightly reddened and excess wax and the assessment was otitis externa. He returned the next morning for treatment and at that time, the right ear was noted to have advanced otitis externa possible otitis media. By October 1979 he was still complaining of infectious right ear. He indicated he had used prescribed medication but still complained of drainage. Tinnitus was noted to be present for duration of the infection and constant. Ear felt plugged up and he appeared to have difficulty hearing. A few days later he still complained of peristent but decreased tinnitus and the assessment was otitis media right resolving. In November 1979 he was seen for complaints of popping and pain in the right ear. The assessment was persistent otitis media right. He was seen again in March 1981 for unequalized pressure and pain in the right ear and found to have otitis media. He also complained of hearing loss at that time. In August 1981 he was again seen for pain and drainage and by the end of august again complained of ringing.

In sum, in the present case similar to Bailey, where the conditions that were alleged to be secondary to the claimant's prostate cancer were documented on examination reports throughout the development of the appeal and formed the basis of many (if not the majority) of the claimant's complaints and reason for requesting a higher evaluation, the Veteran here also began complaining of the ringing and popping of the right ear in conjunction with the otitis externa and otitis media during service. While the Veteran did not explicitly list the tinnitus on the claim form, he did continue to advise medical professionals of the ringing. Accordingly, the Board finds that the claim for tinnitus was reasonably raised in a manner comparable to Bailey.

Having found the claim for tinnitus was reasonably raised as secondary to the claim for the otitis, the date of claim is November 7, 1981. Thus, resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that November 7, 1981, the date of receipt of the initial claim for otitis, is the appropriate effective date for service connection for tinnitus. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.
