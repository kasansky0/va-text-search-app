3. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy is proximately due to his service-connected prostate cancer disability. 

4. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy is proximately due to his service-connected prostate cancer disability. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, to include as secondary to a service-connected disability, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

2. Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for service connection for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, to include as secondary to a service-connected disability, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

3. Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for service connection for left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy, to include as secondary to a service-connected disability, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

4. Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for service connection for right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy, to include as secondary to a service-connected disability, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1965 to November 1985.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  In that rating decision, the RO confirmed and continued its previous denial of service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy and right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy.

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Bilateral Upper and Lower Peripheral Neuropathy

The Veteran asserts that his current bilateral upper and lower peripheral neuropathy is secondary to his service-connected prostate cancer and associated treatment.  See Correspondence, February 2025.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) proximately caused by or (b) proximately aggravated by a service-connected disability.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).  

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall resolve all reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  Reasonable doubt means one which exists because of an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence which does not satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance (which includes but is not limited to equipoise), the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The question before the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that is proximately due to or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  Upon careful review of the evidence of record, and resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral upper and lower peripheral neuropathy is related to his service-connected prostate cancer and associated treatment.

According to a July 2023 VA peripheral nerves examination, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of bilateral upper and lower extremity idiopathic peripheral neuropathy.  See C&P Exam, July 2023.

The Veteran's prostate cancer was service-connected effective from August 10, 2022.  See July 2023 Rating Decision.

With respect to a nexus regarding secondary service connection, the most pertinent evidence of record includes a November 2023 VA medical opinion.  Upon examination, the VA examiner concluded,

The Veteran developed prostate cancer which is conceded a result of Agent Orange exposure. As a result of the veteran's prostate cancer, he underwent radiation treatment.  Research does suggest that radiation treatment can result in radiation-induced neuropathic pain which is progressive.  The Veteran's peripheral neuropathy and trigeminal neuralgia are consistent with this progressive neuropathy, but are secondary to the treatment for prostate cancer and not directly due to Agent Orange or other toxic exposure.  See C&P Exam, received November 8, 2023.

The Board acknowledges the negative opinions of the August 2024 and November 2024 VA examiners.  However, both opinions failed to address the positive nexus opinion from the November 2023 examiner.  Moreover, the August 2024 examiner failed to address the relationship between radiation treatment and neuropathy, and the November 2024 only addressed medication treatment.  See C&P Exam, received August 16, 2024; C&P Exam, received November 15, 2024.  The Board, therefore, finds the opinions to be of little probative value.

Based on the foregoing, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is secondary to his service-connected prostate cancer and associated treatment.  Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.  In reaching that conclusion, the Board has appropriately applied the benefit of the doubt doctrine in this case.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
