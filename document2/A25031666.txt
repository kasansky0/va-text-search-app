ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1972 to August 1974. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

By way of procedural history, November 2020 rating decision denied service connection for tinnitus, finding that the evidence of record failed to show a link between the Veteran's tinnitus and his active duty service. Subsequently, in October 2023, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, along with new and relevant evidence. November 2023 rating decision confirmed and continued denial of service connection for tinnitus. The Veteran sought Higher-Level Review from the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in November 2023, and in an April 2024 rating determination, the RO found that a difference of opinion had been asserted during the Higher-Level Review and that additional development was warranted. Following additional development, the RO, in an August 2024 rating determination, denied service connection for tinnitus. 

In August 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, wherein the Veteran requested direct review by a Veterans Law Judge. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302 (a). With that said, although the Board may not consider any evidence submitted outside the prescribed evidentiary window, it may consider argument raised at any time. 

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus, contending that the ringing in his ears started in service and has been present since that time.

Statutes and Regulations

While there are various routes to establishing service connection, the simplest is diagnosis of a disability during service, since that is essentially per se evidence of service connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). See also, Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) (noting "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty").

Tinnitus is, by definition "a noise in the ears, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking. It is usually subjective in type." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 1914 (30th ed. 2003). Tinnitus is "subjective" in that it is not physical sound, but rather an individual perception or sensation of sound, and thus, its existence is generally determined exclusively by whether the Veteran credibly claims to experience it.

In general, lay opinion is legally competent when (1) it is based on facts in the personal knowledge of the individual, i.e., the underlying evidence was obtained through their own observations or experiences, and (2) it concerns subject matter that is not beyond the knowledge of an ordinary person, i.e., the underlying evidence can be interpreted, understood and applied to arrive at a conclusion without specialized education, training, experience, or other expertise. See Federal Rule of Evidence 701; see also, Bratt v. W. Air Lines, 155 F.2d 850, 854 (10th Cir. 1946) (holding descriptions and interpretations of sounds constitute admissible lay opinions).

Though the Board acknowledges it is not bound by these authorities, it nonetheless finds them persuasive of the conclusion that a lay person is competent to determine whether they have tinnitus, as well as when it began. This comports with other authorities that are binding on the Board, including Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994), Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007), and Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002). As a result, the Board concludes tinnitus can be diagnosed through lay observation alone, and if a veteran credibly reports ringing in their ears, then they have been diagnosed with tinnitus. 

When adjudicating appeals, the Board applies an intentionally generous standard of proof unique in American jurisprudence, created in recognition of the nation's great debt to its veterans. Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014). The core of this standard is the benefit of the doubt doctrine.

In making findings and rendering decisions, the Board employs a balancing test of positive and negative evidence. When they are approximately balanced or nearly equal, the benefit of the doubt doctrine entitles the veteran to the benefit of the doubt, and the Board finds in the veteran's favor. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 131, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Conversely, if the Board finds the evidence tending to disprove a fact or claim predominates to the point the overall evidentiary picture is persuasively against the veteran, reasonable doubt is extinguished, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply, and the Board finds accordingly. See, e.g., Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Mattox v. McDonough, 56 F.4 th 1369, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

Evidence and Analysis 

In the rating decision on appeal, the AOJ conceded, most pertinently, two critical facts: (1) the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise while in service; and, (2) the Veteran has tinnitus. Thus, the only issue before the Board is whether the former caused the latter, and there are two ways of establishing that relationship: (1) in-service onset of the tinnitus symptoms; or, (2) a competent medical opinion connecting the two.

As to whether the Veteran's tinnitus began during his service, the AOJ correctly found that the Veteran's service treatment records are silent for any complaints or treatment of tinnitus while in service. However, the Veteran has consistently reported having ringing in his ears during service, intermittently after separation from active duty, and as of late, in his older years, more frequently. See October 2023 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim; November 2023 Third Party Correspondence; see also February 2025 Correspondence. 

The Board acknowledges the November 2020 and November 2023 VA negative opinions. Specifically, in November 2020, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The rationale states that the Veteran reports intermittent ringing in his ears with an onset of 30 years ago, which would be post separation. Tinnitus is a known symptom associated with hearing loss and hearing loss is currently present upon examination. The examiner finally highlighted the fact that the Veteran is also medically managed for diabetes and intermittent tinnitus is associated with metabolic disorders. The Board deems this opinion inadequate as the rationale is conclusory. The opinion essentially contains only facts and data but fails to connect the facts and data to any definitive conclusion based on the Veteran's overall medical picture. Accordingly, the opinion is afforded no probative weight. In November 2023, a VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The rationale for this opinion states that tinnitus is often the result of military noise exposure, but it does not have a late onset. Also, the intermittent nature of the tinnitus is most consistent with the normal, non-pathologic ear noises that everyone experiences. The Board also finds this decision inadequate. While finding that the Veteran's tinnitus had a late onset, the examiner fails to address the Veteran's consistent report of experiencing ringing in his ears during service and intermittently after service, and as of late, in his older years, more often. As the examiner seemingly failed to consider the Veteran's lay statements, the opinion is afforded no probative weight. 

As the weight of the competent, credible, and most probative evidence of record shows a current tinnitus disability, acoustic trauma during active service, and chronic, continuous symptoms since service. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection for tinnitus is granted on a presumptive basis.
