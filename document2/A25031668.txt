ORDER

Service connection for recurrent tinnitus is granted.

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

1. Recurrent tinnitus has been continuous since service.

2. Bilateral hearing loss was not shown in service, was not shown to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service, was not shown for many years after service, and is not causally or etiologically related to service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, recurrent tinnitus was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C. 1101, 1110, 1112, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2, 20.202, 20.301, 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2024).

2. Bilateral hearing loss was not shown in service and may not be presumed to have been incurred in service.  38 U.S.C. 1101, 1110, 1112, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2, 20.202, 20.301, 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from May 1974 to August 1974.  His appeal stems from March 2022 and June 2022 rating decisions in which the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and recurrent tinnitus.  He subsequently submitted a July 2022 Form 20-0996 requesting higher level review (HLR) of the decisions in accordance with the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA); however, in an August 2022 HLR rating decision, the AOJ affirmed its prior denials.  

In September 2022 and April 2024, the Veteran submitted Supplemental Claims reasserting that his hearing loss and tinnitus warranted service connection; however, in April 2023 and May 2024, the AOJ again denied his claims.  He timely appealed the May 2024 rating decision to the Board via a June 2024 Form 10182.  He requested that his appeal be reviewed on the Direct Review docket; therefore, the Board has considered his claims based on the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.301.  

The Board observes that in December 2024, the Veteran subsequently filed a new Supplemental Claim seeking service connection for his bilateral hearing loss and recurrent tinnitus.  As a general matter, when a claim has been appealed through a request for HLR, a Supplemental Claim, or an appeal to the Board, and is awaiting final adjudication, a veteran cannot have the claim considered at the same time under a different review option (also known as a "concurrent election").  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  

Here, the Veteran submitted his December 2024 Supplemental Claim after his June 2024 appeal to the Board and the AOJ issued a March 2025 decision confirming and continuing its prior denials.  However, he did not withdraw his Form 10182.  The March 2025 rating decision was therefore issued in error.  As such, the Board has retained jurisdiction and will address his claims of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and recurrent tinnitus. 

Finally, additional evidence, to include private medical treatment notes and a letter from a private clinician opining as to a nexus between the Veteran's military service and his hearing loss and tinnitus, was received during a period of time in which new evidence was not allowed.  Accordingly, the Board may not consider this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Turning to the relevant laws and regulations, service connection may be granted on a direct basis as a result of disease or injury incurred in the line of duty in active military, naval, air, or space service based on nexus using a three-element test: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or worsening of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred in or worsened by service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  

Service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 under the following circumstances: (1) where a chronic disease or injury is shown in service and subsequent manifestations of the same disease or injury are shown at a later date unless clearly attributable to an intercurrent cause; or (2) where there is continuity of symptomatology since service; or (3) by showing that the disorder manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of the date of separation from service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307.

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material favorable to the claimant.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant.

Finally, in addition to the above, hearing loss and tinnitus are recognized as "chronic diseases" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); therefore, the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, and 3.309 apply.  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1131 (Fed. Cir. 2013); See also Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).

In the May 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ documented diagnoses of bilateral hearing loss and recurrent tinnitus.  In addition, the AOJ determined that the Veteran's personnel records established in-service duties including construction equipment repair, and that his work in construction equipment repair had a high probability of acoustic trauma.  Finally, in its June 2022 and August 2022 HLR rating decisions, the AOJ conceded in-service noise exposure.  These favorable findings will not be disturbed, and the first two elements of direct service connection- a current diagnosis and in-service incident- have therefore been met.  As such, the Board will consider whether his current hearing loss and tinnitus either stem directly from his in-service noise exposure or meet the criteria for presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, and 3.309.

Recurrent Tinnitus

With respect to the Veteran's tinnitus, he reported in June 2021 and May 2023 medical treatment notes as well as a May 2023 lay statement, that while in service, he was not provided with hearing protection at the gun range.  He indicated that as a result, he developed constant bilateral tinnitus and that the condition had been present since service.  He recalled that he was not evaluated by a doctor at the time of his separation in 1974 and did not go to a doctor until his tinnitus symptoms became excruciating and painful.  The Veteran is competent to assert that he has experienced symptoms of recurrent tinnitus continuously since active service.  Therefore, his competent and credible statements weigh in favor of his claim and establish continuity of symptomatology.

The records reflect an absence of complaints of or treatment for tinnitus for many years after separation from service.  However, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board has found that he had continuous symptoms of tinnitus since his discharge from active service.  Therefore, he meets the requirements for presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  

Notably, VA examiners opined in February 2022 and April 2023 that it was less likely than not that his tinnitus was caused by or a result of an event in military service, to include in-service noise exposure.  However, the Board does not need to reach the weight assignable to the VA examinations and opinions because service connection is granted on a presumptive basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) for the "chronic" disease of recurrent tinnitus based on findings of "continuous" symptoms since active service.  

In sum, there is evidence of in-service acoustic trauma and continuous symptoms of tinnitus since service.  Therefore, recurrent tinnitus is presumed to have been incurred in service and the medical evidence supports service connection for the disorder.  Because the Board is granting service connection for recurrent tinnitus on a presumptive basis based on continuous symptoms since separation, all other theories of service connection are rendered moot.   

Bilateral Hearing Loss

Turning to the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss, he asserts that the disorder stems from his in-service noise exposure.  To this end, he recalled in multiple lay statements and VA examinations between October 2021 and May 2023 that he did not have any problems with his hearings prior to his enlistment.  He said that he was exposed to loud noise over the course of his day-to-day duties, to include serving and training on a rifle range, as well as performing other duties in the barracks.  He asserted that his hearing loss was the product of his exposure to constant gunfire and other loud noises.  He is competent to report symptoms capable of lay observation, such as difficulty hearing, and recount his service history.  However, the weight of the medical evidence does not support his claim.

In this regard, a private clinician noted in October 2021 that the Veteran was diagnosed with severe bilateral high frequency in August 2021.  The clinician opined that it was more likely than not that the disorder was related to his in-service acoustic exposure.  However, the clinician did not provide a rationale for the opinion.  As such, while the October 2021 private medical opinion weighs in favor of the Veteran's claim, it is assigned lesser probative value.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) ("a medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two"). 

Next, a February 2022 VA examination, an examiner noted the Veteran's history of in-service noise exposure on the gun range and in the barracks and diagnosed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.  However, the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the disorder was incurred in or caused by his in-service noise exposure.  To this end, the examiner observed that the Veteran was in active service for 3 months and that no audiograms had been conducted for reference.  In a March 2022 addendum, the examiner further explained that the Veteran's military service ended in 1974 and that during the February 2022 examination, he reported that his hearing loss began approximately 10 years prior to examination (in 2012).

Subsequently in an April 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that during his time in service, he was on the gun range every day and was not given hearing protection.  He said that he also volunteered to work in the kitchen and had a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) of Food Service Specialist.  The examiner observed that after his separation from service, the Veteran worked for 10 years in construction and for over 13 years with United Pipeline.  Finally, the examiner documented that the Veteran had a stroke approximately 3 years prior to the date of examination.  

The April 2023 examiner diagnosed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss but opined that the disorder was less likely than not incurred in or caused by an event in military service.  To this end, the examiner noted that the Veteran's MOS had a low probability for hazardous noise exposure and that had a short amount of service time.  Additionally, the Veteran had post-service hazards, to include working in construction and for United Pipeline.  The examiner further explained that he had no noted audiological results prior to the examination and had incurred a stroke in 2020.  In sum, the examiner offered that it was less likely than not that his hearing loss was caused by or a result of his in-service hearing loss.    

The February 2022, March 2022, and April 2023 VA examinations and medical opinions, when read together, are adequate because the examiners thoroughly reviewed the claims file, discussed the evidence, to include the relationship between the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and his in-service acoustic trauma, and provided a thorough supporting rationale for the conclusions reached.  As such, the examinations and opinions are assigned high probative value.

As a general matter, the Board may favor the opinion of one competent medical expert over another if its statement of reasons and bases is adequate to support that decision.  See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995).  Here, the VA examinations and medical opinions assessed the details of the Veteran's specific case, to include documenting post-service exposure to noise working in construction and for United Pipeline, while the private medical opinion did not offer a rationale.  Therefore, considering the totality of the evidence, the VA examinations and medical opinions outweigh the noted private medical opinion, and the weight of the medical evidence does not support service connection for bilateral hearing loss on a direct basis.  

As to presumptive service connection, hearing loss did not manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service.  To this end, the medical records first reflected a diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss in August 2021.  Moreover, the Veteran asserted in his VA examinations that his hearing loss began as early as 2012.  Even assuming that he developed symptoms of bilateral hearing loss for purposes of VA benefits in 2012, this is outside the one-year legal presumption for certain chronic diseases such as bilateral hearing loss.

Next, the record does not establish continuity of symptomatology under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  As noted above, the evidence shows that for purposes of eligibility for VA benefits, symptoms of bilateral hearing loss first developed in 2012- almost 40 years after the Veteran's separation from service.  Therefore, bilateral hearing loss was not shown until 2012 with documentation beginning in August 2021.  As such, the medical evidence does not support presumptive service connection for bilateral hearing loss based on continuity of symptomatology.

In sum, after a careful review of the record, the weight of the medical evidence fails to establish a nexus between the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss and his in-service hazardous noise exposure and does not demonstrate continuity of symptomatology since separation.  As such, the medical evidence does not support the claim of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and there is no doubt to be otherwise resolved.

The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements regarding the etiologies of his tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss.  He is competent to report symptoms and describe observations because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses.  However, he is not competent to offer an opinion as to the etiology of any current disorder due to the medical complexity of the matters involved.

Such competent evidence has been provided by the medical personnel who have examined the Veteran during his current appeal and by the STRs, examinations, and clinical records that have been obtained and associated with the claims file.  Here, the Board attaches greater weight to the clinical findings than to the lay statements that have been submitted.  Based on the above, service connection is granted for recurrent tinnitus, and the appeal is otherwise denied.

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record for the Board's consideration.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
