REMANDED

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) care provided at Bridgeway Care and Rehabilitation Center at Bridgewater New Jersey (Bridgeway) from May 6, 2024, to June 21, 2024, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from November 1965 to November 1967, and from December 1967 to December 1971.  See DD 214.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from May and June 2024 decisions of the Veterans Health Administration.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim for payment or reimbursement of non-VA care, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

In August 2024, the Board sent the Veteran a letter notifying him of his right to switch dockets to the Evidence Submission Docket, or to the Hearing Docket, within 60 days of the date his appeal was received by the Board, or within one year of the AOJ decision on appeal.  See August 2024 Board Docketing Letter.  To date, the Veteran has not indicated a request to switch dockets.   Therefore, the Board proceeds to the merits of this case.

The Veteran's representative submitted an Informal Hearing Presentation Brief (IHP) which generally indicates that the Veteran has set forth the central elements of his position and asks that consideration be given to the Veteran's contentions and the evidence of record.  See August 2024 IHP, pg. 1.

1. Payment or reimbursement of medical expenses related to non-VA care provided at Bridgeway from May 6, 2024, to June 21, 2024. 

The Veteran contends that his non-VA care at Bridgeway should be paid by VA because he was directed to attend rehabilitation at this facility as there was not enough room at the local VAMC.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182.  He argues that he was informed that the VA Veterans Community Care Program would pay for this care since the VAMC could not accommodate him.  See id. He added, that at the time of his care, he was too ill to coordinate well with the Community Care Program.  See id.  Thus, the Veteran appears to make the argument that his care was authorized non-VA care through the Community Care Program.

The claim was denied by the VHA Office of Community Care because it determined that there was no consult for his stay at Bridgeway, and for this care.  See VHA Medical Reimbursement File, received on February 25, 2025, pg. 2 (containing VHA Health Care Network June 2024 decision). 

The Board notes that for these dates of service, the VHA file only contains 4 pages of record, including the Veteran's VA Form 10182, two decisions, and one Missing Documents Memorandum.  See id. at pg. 1-4.  However, the Missing Documents Memorandum is for the dates of service January 1, 2024, to January 18, 2024.  See id. at pg. 4 (addressing a claim and decision for dates of service January 1, 2024, to January 18, 2024, as missing and further efforts to locate them is futile).  While the Board recognizes that all reasonable efforts to locate said documents may have been exhausted, this claim in this instant appeal before the Board is for dates of service from May 6, 2024, to June 21, 2024.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182.  Thus, the Board finds that the missing document memorandum does not apply to this case.  Additionally, the memorandum does not address the lack of underlying VA treatment records, or private treatment records in the claim file.

The underlying medical records associated with this care would assist the Board in determining whether the Veteran was referred or sent to Bridgeway for this case, and under what type of circumstances, and whether the Board has jurisdiction.  Additionally, the VHA file does not indicate what disorder the rehabilitation care was for.  Without the underlying medical records, private records, and application, the Board cannot make an informed decision as to whether it has jurisdiction, and if so, what is the disposition of the matter.

Finally, the May and June 2024 VHA decisions do not appear to comply with notice requirements.  Generally, a claimant is entitled to receive notice of a decision by the Secretary, which must include particular information, as provided by statute.  38 U.S.C. § 5104.  Following implementation of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), such notice must include the following: identification of the issues adjudicated; a summary of the evidence considered; a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; identification of findings favorable to the claimant; in the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial; an explanation of how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision; and, if applicable, identification of criteria which must be satisfied to grant the claim.   

The Board shall remand for any pre-decisional error on the part of the AOJ to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A and may remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Here, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error has occurred in that a notice of decision was not provided which complies with 5104 and to provide the Board with the underlying records with which to review the claim.  Due process requires that the AOJ ensure that proper notice is provided to the appellant which includes the correct reasons and bases for the determination.  The appellant must still be notified in writing of the decision affecting the payment of benefits, as required by 38 U.S.C. § 5104.  The notification must also include favorable findings.  Such notice must include the following:

1. Identification of the issues adjudicated.

2. A summary of the evidence considered by the Secretary.

3. A summary of the applicable laws and regulations.

4. Identification of findings favorable to the claimant.

5. In the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial.

6. An explanation of how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision.

7. If applicable, identification of the criteria that must be satisfied to grant [the claim].

See 38 U.S.C. §5104 (b).

The Board finds remand is needed to obtain and associate with the electronic record, the Veteran's complete VHA claims file, including any VHA file evidence, to include VA treatment records, relevant private treatment and medical bills, AOJ decision(s), claim(s) for reimbursement, and any statement(s) from the Veteran are necessary to determine whether entitlement to payment.  The decision as to this claim should comply with the notice requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b).

The Veteran is notified that under the modernized appeal system, remands do not automatically return to the Board for adjudication.  Should the AOJ deny the claim, and the appellant wish to continue its appeal before the Board, the appellant should file an appropriate NOD (VA Form 10182) within the applicable appeal period after the AOJ (VHA) adjudication of the claim.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. The AOJ must reconstruct the Veteran's VHA claim file related to the non-VA care provided by Bridgewater for dates of service on appeal from May 6, 2024, to June 21, 2024, and associate it with the electronic record.  This includes obtaining any outstanding VHA records, VA treatment records, relevant private treatment records (e.g., Bridgeway records), medical bills, decisions, claims, and Veteran statements.

2. The AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability, regarding the dates of service in this appeal, if the records are unable to be obtained.

3. The AOJ decision on this matter should comply with the notice requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b).
