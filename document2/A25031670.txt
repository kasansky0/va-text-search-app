CONCLUSION OF LAW

A complete VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), requesting Board review of the issue of entitlement to payment or reimbursement of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on January 14, 2021, has not been received; thus, the appeal is dismissed.  38?U.S.C. §?7105; 38?C.F.R. §§?20.202, 20.204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In November 2021, the Board received a VA Form 10182 from Benefit Recovery electing the Direct Review docket to review a January 14, 2021, episode of care that was denied in an April 2021 decision by the VA Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  Benefit Recovery is a revenue cycle management company.

The Board finds that Benefit Recovery is not a proper claimant that may file a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement.  38?C.F.R. §?20.204 (a Notice of Disagreement may be filed by a claimant or by his or her representative if a proper Power of Attorney is on record or accompanies such Notice of Disagreement). 

"Claimant" is generally defined under VA regulations as a person who filed a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA.  38?C.F.R. §?20.3(f), (g).  Under Part 17 of the regulations, claimants for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical services for unauthorized treatment may include the veteran who received the services; the hospital, clinic, or community resource which provided the services; or a person other than the veteran who paid for the services.  38?C.F.R. §?17.123. 

When viewed in context of authorized non-VA medical services, health care providers include entities authorized to furnish medical services to covered veterans that enter into bid contracts to establish networks of health care providers.  See generally 38?U.S.C. §?1703(c), (h); 38?C.F.R. §§?17.4005, 17.4030.  There is no indication under the applicable law and regulations that a non-veteran entity that did not furnish the underlying medical services may be considered a claimant. 

The record does not reflect that Benefit Recovery is a health care provider as described in the regulations or that Benefit Recovery provided the underlying treatment on January 14, 2021, associated with a claim for payment for authorized non-VA medical services.  Moreover, Benefit Recovery is not an accredited representative or agent of the Veteran as defined by the regulations.  See 38?C.F.R. §§?14.627, 14.629.  

The Board finds the November 2021 Form 10182 filed by Benefit Recovery did not initiate appellate review.  38?U.S.C. §?7105(a), (b)(2)(A) (notices of disagreement shall be in writing, shall identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees, and may be filed by the claimant, the claimant's legal guardian, or such accredited representative, attorney, or authorized agent as may be selected by the claimant or legal guardian); 38?C.F.R. §§?20.202(a), 20.204.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
