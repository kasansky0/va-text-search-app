ORDER

Service connection for right shoulder strain is granted.

REMANDED

Service connection for left ear hearing loss is remanded.

Service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's right shoulder strain, had its onset in and is related to service.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for right shoulder strain have been met.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 1154, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303.?? 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 1987 to August 1990.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from July 2023 and November 2023 rating decisions from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the July 2023 rating decision, the RO denied entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss and tinnitus. In the November 2023 rating decision, the RO denied entitlement to service connection for heart disease and right shoulder injury.  

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in July 2023 and November 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeal Modernization Act (AMA), applies.? 

In the June VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.? Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 and November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.? 38 U.S.C. § 20.301.? 

Service Connection?? 

Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.? See Shedden v. Principi,?381 F.3d 1163?(Fed. Cir. 2004).????? 

Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. ?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).????? 

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value. ?38?U.S.C. §?7104(a); Baldwin v. West,?13?Vet. App.?1?(1999); see?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).????? 

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. ?38?U.S.C. §?5107.? When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.????? 

To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must persuasively stand against a finding that the evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim.? Lynch v. McDonough,?21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).????? 

The Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence.? Buchanan v. Nicholson,?451 F.3d 1331?(Fed. Cir. 2006).? The evaluation of evidence generally involves a 3-step inquiry.? First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source.? The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief.? Barr v. Nicholson,?21?Vet. App.?303?(2007) (Observing that once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible).????? 

The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the proffered evidence in light of the entirety of the record.? The Board also notes that under certain circumstances, lay evidence may be sufficient to establish a nexus.? Davidson v. Shinseki,?581 F.3d 1313, 1316?(Fed. Cir. 2009); Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 469?(1994).? Lay evidence has been found to be competent with regard to a disease that has "unique and readily identifiable features" that are "capable of lay observation."? Barr v. Nicholson,?21?Vet. App.?303, 308-09?(2007); Petitti v. McDonald,?27?Vet. App.?415, 427-28?(2015) (where the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims found objective evidence of pain need not come from a medical professional; a lay person may provide the requisite confirmation).????? 

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.? A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of symptoms.? Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 470?(1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).? Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.? Davidson v. Shinseki,?581 F.3d 1313, 1316?(Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson,?492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77?(Fed. Cir. 2007).????? 

1. Service connection for right shoulder strain is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for his right shoulder strain, which he asserts is related to service as his symptoms had its onset in service.  See April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; see also June 2023 VA examination.  

Here, as explained below, the Board finds that all three elements of direct service connection are established by the competent and credible lay and medical evidence of records as to the Veteran's right shoulder strain.? 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).??   

In the November 2023 rating decision, the RO made the favorable finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a right shoulder disability, which was confirmed in the August 2023 VA examination, diagnosed as a right shoulder strain.  

As to the in-service disease or injury element, in the November 2023 rating decision, the RO made the favorable finding that the Veteran had a qualifying event, injury, or disease during service, as the Veteran's STRs note a shoulder complaint.  The Veteran's May 1990 STRs show the Veteran sought treatment for right shoulder pain, which was diagnosed as a strain.   

As the finder of fact, the Board concludes that the first and second element of service connection can be reasonably conceded.? What remains necessary is competent evidence of a nexus between the current right shoulder strain and service.? 

The Board finds that the evidence is at least approximately balanced as to the theory that the Veteran's current right shoulder strain began in service and has continued to the present.? 

The Board has been charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence.  Davidson v. Shinseki,?581 F. 3d 1313?(Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson,?492 F. 3d 1372?(Fed. Cir. 2007).? Indeed, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to do so.  Bryan v. West,?13?Vet. App.?482, 488-89 (2000).? 

During the June 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his right shoulder pain has gradually worsened and noted an onset throughout his military career.  The Veteran reported an injury related to his physical fitness training and his symptoms worsened with his everyday activities required by his military duties.  Further, the Veteran has a first documented complaint of right shoulder pain while in-service.  See May 1990 STRs.  

However, in the June 2023 VA examination, the examiner opined that the Veteran's right shoulder strain was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner's rationale was that per a review of the STRs, there was not enough evidence to substantiate a claim of right shoulder injury during service.  Here, the June 2023 VA examiner effectively disregarded the Veteran's competent and credible lay account of having issues with his shoulder in and since service and ignored the Veteran's May 1990 STRs.  

The Board notes that the Veteran's reports are consistent with the circumstances of his service.? 38?U.S.C. §?1154; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).? Thus, the lay and medical evidence shows that the Veteran's right shoulder pain and symptoms, which have been linked to the current diagnosis, had their onset in service and have been recurrent since that time and thus service connection is warranted.? 

The evidence shows that the Veteran's right shoulder condition is related to service, thus, service connection is warranted.? See Flynn v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?500, 503 (1994) (noting that "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"); see also 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a) (Service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces).? 

The Board acknowledges the negative VA nexus opinion of record; however, because the Board finds the Veteran's report that his right shoulder symptoms started in service, and has been recurrent since, to be credible, service connection is warranted.? The competent and credible evidence is at least approximately balanced, and benefit of the doubt doctrine applies.? 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).? 

In light of the foregoing, and after resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for right shoulder strain is warranted.? See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).? 

REASONS FOR REMAND

As a preliminary matter, the Board is cognizant that the Veteran is currently incarcerated.  In this regard, the Board notes that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has long held that incarcerated veterans are entitled to the same care and consideration given to their fellow veterans. See Bolton v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 185, 191 (quoting Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991)).  Further, the Court has cautioned "those who adjudicate claims of incarcerated veterans to be certain that they tailor their assistance to the peculiar circumstances of confinement." Id. 

As such, on remand, the RO should either afford the Veteran a VA examination, or if that is not possible, coordinate efforts with the correctional facility, either by a VA examiner or by an examiner at the prison facility, to accommodate the Veteran by arranging for an examination to be conducted at the correctional facility at which he is incarcerated.  

If it is not possible to have the Veteran examined at the prison facility, in light of Bolton and Wood, the Board concludes that a VA examiner should review the Veteran's medical records and opine as to the below examination questions.  

1. Service connection for left ear hearing loss is remanded.  

2. Service connection for tinnitus is remanded.  

As there is considerable overlap in the applicable evidence for the Veteran's claims, the Board will discuss them together.?? 

The Board has identified a pre-decisional duty to assist error necessitating remand for additional development prior to appellate review.  

In the June 2023 VA examination, the Veteran underwent an audiological examination that revealed the following pure tone thresholds, in decibels:??? 

???? 	??? 	??? 	HERTZ??? 	??? 	??? 

??? 	500??? 	1000??? 	2000??? 	3000??? 	4000??? 

LEFT??? 	10 	10	20	15	20

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 94 percent in the left ear.? Here, the Veteran's pure tone thresholds and speech recognition scores do not demonstrate left ear hearing loss for VA purposes.  Rather, the Veteran was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in the frequency range of 6000Hz or higher in the left ear.  The Veteran also reported tinnitus occurring for the last 5 to 10 years, and "most of the time in the left ear." 

In the June 2023 rating decision, the RO made the favorable finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with left ear sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.  As to the in-service disease or injury element, in the June 2023 rating decision, the RO made the favorable finding that the Veteran had a qualifying event, injury, or disease during service, as the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) was an aviation ordinance man thus concedes noise exposure.  

In the June 2023 VA examination, the examiner opined that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss and tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or a result of the Veteran's military service.  The examiner's rationale discussed the Veteran's high probability of hazardous noise exposure but noted that the Veteran's STRs revealed hearing within normal limits in both ears with no major threshold shifts beyond test variability from the entrance examination in 1987 to separation in 1990. 

The Board notes, however, that the Veteran's STRs show a significant threshold shift in the Veteran's audiogram.  See September 1987, February 1989 and June 1990 STRs.  In addition, the Veteran was briefed on the hearing conservation program.  See September 1987 STRs.   

The Board finds that the June 2023 VA examination report to be inadequate. Here, the examiner failed to address the facts and evidence specific to this Veteran and did not address the Veteran's STRs, and significant threshold shift. Failing to obtain an adequate opinion and relying on an inadequate opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.? Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 312 (2007).? 

When VA undertakes to provide an examination or opinion, it must be an adequate one.? See Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 311 (2007).? To be considered adequate, a medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.? See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295 (2008).?? 

In addition, a medical opinion is adequate when the medical expert discussed the relevant facts of a claimant's case, including any relevant lay statements about the disability picture, such that the opinion and rationale sufficiently inform the Board of the expert's judgment on the medical question.? Miller?v. Wilkie,?32?Vet. App.?249, 254?(2020).? 

Accordingly, this matter must be remanded to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error and to afford the Veteran an adequate examination.? 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R § 20.802(a); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 312 (2007) (VA must provide an examination that is adequate for rating purposes).? 

3. Service connection for heart condition is remanded.  

The Board has identified a pre-decisional duty to assist error necessitating remand for additional development prior to appellate review.  

In June 2023 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for heart conditions.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran as having congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, and dilated cardiomyopathy.  During the examination, the Veteran also reported a long history of hypertension, and the examiner noted the Veteran's use of medication and treatment for his congestive heart failure and hypertension.  The examiner provided negative nexus opinions regarding the Veteran's congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, and dilated cardiomyopathy.  The examiner's rationale was based on a lack of evidence for a heart condition in the Veteran's STRs.  Thus, the examiner failed to address the Veteran's abnormal ECG's in-service.  See June 1988 and January 1989 STRs.  Further, the examiner failed to address the Veteran's hypertension.  Consequently, the June 2023 examination is inadequate and afforded no probative value.  Failing to obtain an adequate opinion and relying on an inadequate opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.? Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 312 (2007).? 

When VA undertakes to provide an examination or opinion, it must be an adequate one.? See Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 311 (2007).? To be considered adequate, a medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.? See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295 (2008).?? 

In addition, a medical opinion is adequate when the medical expert discussed the relevant facts of a claimant's case, including any relevant lay statements about the disability picture, such that the opinion and rationale sufficiently inform the Board of the expert's judgment on the medical question.? Miller?v. Wilkie,?32?Vet. App.?249, 254?(2020).? 

Accordingly, this matter must be remanded to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error and to afford the Veteran an adequate examination.? 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R § 20.802(a); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 312 (2007) (VA must provide an examination that is adequate for rating purposes).? 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for VA examination(s) to determine the nature, onset, and etiology of any current left ear hearing loss and tinnitus. 

All necessary tests should be performed.  All findings should be reported in detail.  The examiner must obtain a history from the Veteran as to the onset of his hearing loss and tinnitus. 

If it is not possible to afford the Veteran a VA examination, coordinate efforts with the correctional facility, either by a VA examiner or by an examiner at the prison facility, to accommodate the Veteran by arranging for an examination to be conducted at the correctional facility at which he is incarcerated.  

If it is not possible to have the Veteran examined at the prison facility, in light of Bolton and Wood, a VA examiner should review the Veteran's medical records and respond to the inquiries below.

The examiner is asked to address the following: 

(a)	Please opine as to the likelihood that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss had its onset in or is otherwise etiologically related to an in-service event, injury, or disease. 

(b)	Please opine as to the likelihood that the Veteran's tinnitus had its onset in or is otherwise etiologically related to an in-service event, injury, or disease. 

The examiner must also acknowledge and discuss the competent lay evidence as well as the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) as an aviation ordinance man exposed to hazardous noise in the performance of his daily duties. 

2. Schedule the Veteran for VA examination(s) to determine the nature, onset, and etiology of the claimed heart condition, to include congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertension.  All necessary tests should be performed.? All findings should be reported in detail.?

If it is not possible to afford the Veteran a VA examination, coordinate efforts with the correctional facility, either by a VA examiner or by an examiner at the prison facility, to accommodate the Veteran by arranging for an examination to be conducted at the correctional facility at which he is incarcerated.  

If it is not possible to have the Veteran examined at the prison facility, in light of Bolton and Wood, a VA examiner should review the Veteran's medical records and respond to the inquiries below.

The examiner should address the likelihood any of the currently diagnosed conditions had its onset, or the underlying disease process began, in service, or is otherwise related to service, to include toxic exposure risk activity. 

The VA medical opinion provider should consider: 

(a.) the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran; and 

(b.) the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran. 

A fully articulated medical rationale for any opinion expressed must be set forth in the medical report. 

The VA medical opinion provider should discuss the particulars of this Veteran's medical history and relevant medical science as applicable to this case, which may reasonably explain the medical guidance in the study of this case.
