ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had OSA at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for OSA are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2007 to March 2012.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2023 decision.  In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2023 decision.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

VA regulations provide that, "[u]pon request, a claimant is entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim... before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1).  That regulation does not indicate that the claimant is entitled to pre-decisional notice of this optional hearing.  In fact, 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(1) provides that, following a decision, "[c]laimants and their representatives are entitled to notice of any decision made by VA affecting the payment of benefits or the granting of relief... [including] the right to a hearing on any issue involved in the claim as provided in paragraph (d) of this section...."  Read together with § 3.103(d), the only notice § 3.103(b) requires is that a claimant be provided notice of the right for a hearing with notification of the decision (by definition, a post-decisional notice).  In November 2022, VA amended VA Form 21-526EZ and, in May 2024, VA amended VA Form 20-0995 to inform claimants of the right to a hearing at any time during the claims process.  The claim in this appeal were originally filed in July 2022, prior to the amended version of VA Form 21-536EZ.  However, the Board finds that any error in the failure to inform the Veteran of the right to a pre-decisional hearing before the RO was harmless error.

In Bowen, the Court found that when a claimant is denied a hearing before the RO, there is no due process violation if he is subsequently offered the opportunity for a hearing before the Board, even if a hearing was not requested or conducted, as long as there is no violation of due process concerning the Board hearing opportunity.  Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253-4 (2012).  The facts in the case can be differentiated on several levels, to include that the Veteran did not actually request an RO hearing and the issue in Bowen was not one of notice.  Regardless, the Board cannot find a basis to conclude that the underlying holding and logic of the Bowen case would not lead to the same finding of no prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.  The notification letters informing the Veteran of the rating decisions in this appeal included VA Form 20-0998, Your Right to Seek Review of Our Decision, outlining the Veteran's appeal options, to include a hearing before the Board.  Additionally, in the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran was provided with an option to request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge.  The Veteran instead elected for Direct review by a Veterans Law Judge, and the form explicitly states that by choosing this option, he does not want a Board hearing.  Because the Veteran was provided with notice of the right to appeal to the Board, as well as the right to a Board hearing, there was no due process violation in the processing of the claim or any suggestion that he was prejudiced by the failure of VA to provide a hearing at the RO level. See Bowen.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for OSA

With any claim for service connection, a current disability is required.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  In McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007), the Court held that the requirement of the existence of a current disability is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time he files his claim for service connection or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim.  However, in Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013), the Court held that when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to a claimant filing a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency.

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  

The Board may appropriately favor the opinion of one competent medical authority over another.  See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).  The Board has the authority to "discount the weight and probity of evidence in the light of its own inherent characteristics and its relationship to other items of evidence."  Madden v. Brown, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

A Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469.  Generally, lay testimony is not competent to prove a matter requiring medical expertise.  Id. at 470.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran contends that he has OSA because pain from his service-connected musculoskeletal conditions prevent him from being able to sleep on his side and make it difficult to fall or stay asleep.  He also contends that weight gain from these conditions prevent him from exercising. July 2022 Statement In Support of Claim. The record also appears to raise the theory of direct service connection. See July 2022 VA Examination Report.

The record includes a July 2022 Medical Nexus Letter signed by Dr. Z.M.  In that report, Dr. Z.M. included the results of a STOP-Bang Questionnaire.  Dr. Z.M. provided two clinical studies which conclude that "polysomnography should be performed actively for patients with high STOP-Bang scores" and "the higher the STOP-Bang score, the greater is the probability of moderate-to-severe OSA."  In the STOP-Bang questionnaire, the Veteran endorsed loud snoring and feeling tired during the daytime.  The Veteran was asked if anyone had observed him stop breathing or choking/gasping during sleep.  The Veteran responded with no.  Based on the results of the STOP-Bang Questionnaire, Dr. Z.M. diagnosed the Veteran with OSA. 

VA treatment records are silent for any symptoms, treatment, or diagnosis of OSA.

The Veteran underwent a VA OSA examination in July 2022 which was finalized in January 2023 upon receipt of the results of a sleep study.  The Veteran stated that his symptoms of snoring, feeling fatigued, and difficulty sleeping began in 2010 and have since worsened.  He has not sought medical care for sleep apnea. The examiner found that the Veteran does have persistent daytime hypersomnolence but found that the Veteran does not have OSA or any sleep disorder breathing based on the results of a January 2023 sleep study.  The sleep study showed "no evidence of significant obstructive sleep apnea or sleep disordered breathing." The examiner found that the Veteran does not currently have OSA, and he has never had OSA.  

The Board finds the July 2022 VA examination to be the most probative evidence of record.  The examination was based on a review of the Veteran's history, a physical examination of the Veteran, and objective diagnostic testing.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). The VA examiner did not specifically address the private opinion or the Stop-Bang Questionnaire, but instead used a diagnostic tool to determine that the Veteran does not have sleep apnea.

The Board finds the July 2022 opinion by Dr. Z.M. to be significantly less probative.  There is no indication that the doctor examined the Veteran. Additionally, the scientific articles supplied by Dr. Z.M. do no support a conclusion that OSA can be diagnosed by the results of a STOP-Bang questionnaire.  Those studies conclude that "polysomnography should be performed actively for patients with high STOP-Bang scores" and "the higher the STOP-Bang score, the greater is the probability of moderate-to-severe OSA."  The STOP-Bang score is merely an indicator that the Veteran has OSA. Dr. Z.M. diagnosed the Veteran with OSA based on the results of a screening tool and not based on the results of a sleep study.  The Board cannot accept an obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis based solely on the findings of a STOP-Bang questionnaire. 

The Board finds that the most probative evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of OSA.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  There is no evidence to support a diagnosis of OSA at any time during or recent to the Veteran's filing of the claim.  See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  Thus, a cornerstone element of service connection has not been met, and service connection is not warranted.  

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms that he can readily observe, such as snoring, feeling fatigued, and difficulty sleeping.  However, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis of OSA because he does not have the requisite medical training.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Instead, the Board gives greater probative value to the July 2022 VA examiner's opinion, which found no current diagnosis of sleep apnea.

For the above reasons, the evidence persuasively weighs against entitlement to service connection for OSA.  As the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximate, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  For these reasons, the claim is denied.
