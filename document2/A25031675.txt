FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's left upper extremity radiculopathy has manifested in moderate incomplete paralysis of the middle radicular group. 

2. For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's right upper extremity radiculopathy has manifested in moderate incomplete paralysis of the middle radicular group.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a 40 percent rating, but no higher, for left upper extremity radiculopathy are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.69, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8511.

2. The criteria for a 30 percent rating, but no higher, for right upper extremity radiculopathy are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.69, 4.124a, DC 8511.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1978 to June 1982. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an August 2023 decision, which awarded service connection for bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy with 20 percent ratings for each upper extremity, effective June 22, 2023. In May 2024, the RO issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior August 2023 decision. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 RO decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the RO issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Neither the Veteran nor the Veteran's representative has raised any other issues with regard to the duty to notify or duty to assist as they pertain to the issues decided in this appeal. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

The analysis in this decision focuses on the most relevant evidence and on what the evidence shows or does not show with respect to the issues decided in this decision. The Veteran should not assume that evidence that is not explicitly discussed in the decision has been overlooked. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (noting that the law requires only that reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant be addressed).

The Board notes that the BVA docketing letter dated in June 2024 advised the Veteran that he had the option to switch from the Direct Review docket to another docket, and that such requests must be filed within 60 days of the date the Board received his VA Form 10182 or within one year of the date of the decision being appealed, which in this case was May 9, 2024.  The time limiting for making such a switch has not yet expired.  However, given that this decision grants higher ratings up to the levels specifically requested by the Veteran's representative in a letter dated May 20, 2024, the Board concludes that further delay would serve no useful purpose.

1. Entitlement to a 40 percent rating, and no higher, for left upper extremity radiculopathy

2. Entitlement to a 30 percent rating, and no higher, for right upper extremity radiculopathy

The Veteran is seeking higher ratings for his bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy. Specifically, the Veteran's representative argued that the evidence is, at the very least, in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's overall disability picture more nearly approximates moderate or mild incomplete paralysis of the middle radicular group. 

The Board notes that the review period begins June 22, 2023, the effective date of the award of service connection for bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy. 

Paralysis of the middle radicular group is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8511. Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent for both the major (dominant) and minor (non-dominant) extremity. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated 40 percent for the major extremity and 30 percent for the minor extremity. Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 50 percent for the major extremity and 40 percent for the minor extremity. Complete paralysis; adduction and rotation of arm, flexion of elbow, and extension of wrist lost or severely affected, is rated at 70 percent for the major extremity and 60 percent for the minor extremity. 38 C.F.R § 4.124a.  

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves." The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).

While the Board is not bound by the VA M21-1 reference guide, the standards provided in the M21-1 are "relevant guidance promulgated for the purpose of facilitating the efficient and proper resolution of claims, "which the Board must consider and address as part of its duty to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision. Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 17-18 (2021) (citing Healy v. McDonough, 33 Vet. App. 312 (2021) and Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018)). The M21-1 offers guidance in the assignment of mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe evaluations for peripheral nerve conditions. The guidelines provided by the M21-1 for distinguishing the mild and moderate above levels of impairment first note that the "mild" level of evaluation would be more reasonably assigned when sensory symptoms are recurrent but not continuous, assigned a lower medical grade reflecting less impairment, and/or affect a smaller area in the nerve distribution. The guidelines also note that a very minimal reflex or motor abnormality could potentially be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis. M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 12, Sections A.2.b and A.2.c.

The M21-1 guidelines note that a "moderate" level of evaluation should reflect "the most significant and disabling cases of sensory-only involvement," indicated by continuous symptoms, symptoms of a higher medical grade reflecting greater impairment, and/or symptoms affecting a larger area in the nerve distribution. The guidelines note that combinations of significant sensory changes and reflexes or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes graded as medically moderate may fall into the moderate level of evaluation. M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 12, Sections A.2.b and A.2.c.

Finally, under the M21-1 guidelines, in general, for "severe" incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve, motor and/or reflex impairment (for example atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) "at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability" is expected. Even though severe incomplete paralysis should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs or symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve. Id. 

These M21-1 provisions are relevant because the issue on appeal deals with the proper rating for the Veteran's bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy, and the provision provide guidance for assigning levels of incomplete paralysis of the peripheral nerves. These provisions, however, are neither favorable nor unfavorable, as they do not provide objective criteria for determining the severity of the condition. Rather, these provisions, just like DC 8511, rely in the application of relative and subjective terms (in this case, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe) to describe the severity of the condition. Notwithstanding, the Board will utilize these provisions in this adjudication, as they include considerations that are not explicitly part of the rating criteria under DC 8511.

In August 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA neck (cervical spine) conditions examination. The examiner noted that the Veteran was left-hand dominant.

Regarding impairment of motor functions, his bilateral upper extremity motor strength was rated as four out of five for elbow flexion and extension, wrist flexion and extension, and finger flexion and abduction. A rating of four denotes active movement against some resistance, which supports a finding of incomplete paralysis.

Regarding sensory disturbance, the Veteran had decreased sensation to light touch (dermatome) testing at the bilateral shoulder area (C5), inner/outer forearm (C6-T1), and hand/fingers (C6-8).

Regarding loss of reflexes, the Veteran had normal deep tendon reflexes at the bilateral biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis.

Regarding radicular pain and other signs and symptoms, the examiner indicated that the Veteran had moderate constant pain of the bilateral upper extremities, severe intermittent pain (usually dull) of the bilateral upper extremities, mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias of the bilateral upper extremities, and mild numbness of the bilateral upper extremities.

Regarding muscle atrophy, the examiner indicated that the Veteran had none. 

Based on the above, the Board finds that the disability is primarily manifested by slight impairment of motor functions, sensory disturbance, constant moderate pain, and intermittent severe pain. The Board also finds that the most probative evidence of record is against a finding that the disability is manifested by trophic changes, loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis. As noted, the M21-1 guidelines note that combinations of significant sensory changes and reflexes or motor changes of a lower degree may fall into the moderate level of evaluation. The Board thus finds that the level of impairment is most analogous to moderate incomplete paralysis.

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing that the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected. Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted. 

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy manifested in mild or moderate incomplete paralysis. Accordingly, the Board concludes that ratings of 40 percent for left upper extremity radiculopathy and 30 percent for right upper extremity radiculopathy are warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
