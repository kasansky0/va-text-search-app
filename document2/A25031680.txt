The appeal for an increased disability rating for a linear upper back scar is dismissed.

The appeal for an increased disability rating for a right-side neck scar is dismissed.

The appeal for an increased disability rating for a painful and tender neck scar is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At his April 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran provided competent and credible sworn testimony that, during the entire period on appeal, despite being a combat medic during service and subsequently training as a nurse, he has not been able to maintain employment since March 2012 because of the severe symptoms associated with his service-connected PTSD; he experiences moodiness and anger towards the world that makes it impossible for him to interact with others effectively; he has unpredictable behavior that can switch at any moment and he can become volatile and angry; he has sought treatment for his PTSD symptoms but continues to experience symptoms that have been described as "severe" (see e.g., June 2021 PTSD treatment note); furthermore, his symptoms have caused him to isolate, have caused fractured family relationships and unstable living situations. The Board cannot assign significant probative weight to a March 2019 VA examination report because it is an outlier compared to the rest of the evidence of record, indicating that the examiner did not base the assessment on an accurate factual premise. The Board finds the Veteran's symptoms during the appeal period most closely approximate the criteria for total occupational and social impairment. 

2. At his April 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran asked to withdraw the appeal for an increased disability rating for a linear upper back scar; based on the pre-hearing discussion, the Board is satisfied that this is an informed withdrawal. 

3. At his April 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran asked to withdraw the appeal for an increased disability rating for a right-side neck scar; based on the pre-hearing discussion, the Board is satisfied that this is an informed withdrawal. 

4. At his April 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran asked to withdraw the appeal for an increased disability rating for a painful and tender neck scar; based on the pre-hearing discussion, the Board is satisfied that this is an informed withdrawal.

5. Given the award of a 100 percent disability rating for service-connected PTSD during the entire period on appeal, the appeal for a TDIU rating is moot.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria are met for a 100 percent increased disability rating for service-connected PTSD. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (Code) 9411.

3. The criteria are met for dismissal of the appeal for an increased disability rating for a right-side neck scar. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

4. The criteria are met for dismissal of the appeal for an increased disability rating for a painful and tender neck scar. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

5. The criteria are met for dismissal of the appeal for a TDIU rating as moot. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1986 to April 1992. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2020 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the September 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on April 1, 2025.

By law, for claims appealed in this docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. An increased disability rating of 100 percent for service-connected PTSD is granted.

For the reasons outlined in more detail above in the Findings of Fact section, the appeal for an increased rating for PTSD is granted.

2. The appeal for an increased disability rating for a linear upper back scar is dismissed.

3. The appeal for an increased disability rating for a right-side neck scar is dismissed.

4. The appeal for an increased disability rating for a painful and tender neck scar is dismissed.

The above listed claims will be addressed together in this opinion because they are closely related and based on the same or similar facts and law.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. In the present case, the appellant has withdrawn his appeals for increased ratings for a linear upper back scar, a right-side neck scar, and a painful and tender neck scar and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.

5. The appeal for a TDIU rating is dismissed as moot.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

Here, the Board has granted a 100 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD; hence, the issue of a TDIU rating is moot.
