DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

The reduction of the disability rating for anterior trunk scars from 10 percent to a noncompensable evaluation, effective October 1, 2023, was improper, and the 10 percent rating is restored.

REMANDED

For the period on appeal prior to October 1, 2023, entitlement to an increased disability rating in excess of 10 percent for anterior scars is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The AOJ did not put forth any explanation to show that the Veteran's scar disability had improved under the ordinary conditions of life and work to establish that a reduction is warranted.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The rating reduction for anterior trunk scars from 10 percent to a noncompensable evaluation was improper, and the previously assigned 10 percent disability rating is restored, effective October 1, 2023.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.344.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from January 1981 to March 1981. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 Higher-Level Review rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office of the previous July 2023 rating decision that decreased the Veteran's disability rating for anterior scars from 10 percent disabling to a noncompensable evaluation, pursuant to a May 2023 rating decision that proposed reduction.  Of note, the Higher-Level Review does not allow for the consideration of new evidence and only considers the evidentiary record at the time of the rating decision on review, which in this case, was the July 2023 rating decision.

The Veteran timely appealed the September 2023 Higher-Level Review rating decision with submission of a March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  She elected the Direct Review docket.  Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Notably, remand to the AOJ is only warranted to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating a claim (including when the AOJ failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain VA treatment records or relevant federal or private treatment records, failed to obtain a VA examination, or provided an inadequate VA examination or opinion).  38 C.F.R. §20.802 (a).  

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  Thus, the Board may not consider this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  However, as these matters are being remanded for further development, the additional evidence will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.

Importantly, the Veteran's reduced rating for anterior trunk scars occurred as a result of an initial request for increased disability rating in January 2023; thus, the issue of an increased rating is part and parcel of the claim for restoration of the 10 percent disability rating.  See Veteran's January 2023 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c), (h); May 2023 Rating Decision (Rating Reduction Proposed); July 2023 Rating Decision (Rating Reduced); September 2023 Higher-Level Review Rating Decision.

As a final preliminary matter, the Veteran has separate appeals pending that cannot be merged with the current matters on appeal; a decision on the matters will be addressed in separate decisions, if in order.

Now the matters before the Board.

Rating Reduction

Generally, VA must abide by specific procedural protections that apply when a Veteran's rating is reduced.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e).  In this case, the Board is restoring the 10 percent rating for anterior trunk scars, effective October 1, 2023, the date the reduction was implemented.  As such, any discussion as to compliance with the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) is rendered moot. 

Substantively, VA is required to comply with several regulations applicable to all rating-reduction cases, regardless of the rating level or the length of time that the rating has been in effect.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10, 4.13; see Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420 (1993).  These provisions impose a clear requirement that VA rating reductions be based upon review of the entire history of a Veteran's disability.  See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  As such, VA is required to determine, based upon review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability and whether the examination reports reflecting such change are based upon thorough examinations. Thus, in any rating-reduction case, not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred but also that the improvement actually reflects an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  See Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 350 (2000).

The Veteran need not demonstrate that he is entitled to retain the higher rating; rather, it must be shown that the AOJ's reduction was warranted.  See Kitchens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 320 (1995); Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 419 (1993).  For a rating in effect less than five years, this may be shown by a reexamination showing physical improvement.  38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c).  The examination reports on which the reduction is based must be adequate.  See Tucker v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 201 (1992) (holding that the failure of the examiner in that case to review the claims file rendered the reduction decision void ab initio).

In considering the propriety of a reduction, the Board must focus on the evidence available to the AOJ at the time the reduction was effectuated (although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered in the context of considering whether actual improvement was demonstrated).  Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 281-82 (1992).  Where doubt remains, the rating agency will continue the rating in effect, and consider scheduling reexamination 18, 24, or 30 months later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (b).  Where a rating reduction was made without observance of law, the reduction must be vacated, and the prior rating restored.  Schafrath, 1 Vet. App. at 595.

Facts and Analysis

In this case, service connection was granted for the Veteran's anterior trunk scar, associated with her service-connected right breast fibroadenoma, in a January 2019 rating decision.  An initial noncompensable evaluation was assigned under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7802, effective October 30, 2015.  The Veteran appealed and pursuant to a May 2022 Board remand, the AOJ increased the disability rating to 10 percent under DC 7804, effective September 19, 2022, in a November 2022 rating decision.  As noted above, the Veteran's disability rating for her service connected anterior trunk scars was reduced effective October 1, 2023, from a 10 percent disability rating to a noncompensable evaluation, in a July 2023 rating decision and continued in the September 2023 Higher-Level Review rating decision on appeal.  

The Veteran's ratings for service-connected anterior trunk scars had been in effect for approximately one year and one month.  Therefore, the additional protections provided under 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 for ratings in effect for a minimum of five years are not applicable. 

Pursuant to the Veteran's January 2023 request for an increased rating for anterior trunk scars, she underwent an April 2023 VA examination to assess the nature and severity of the scarring caused by her service-connected right breast fibroadenoma.  The examination report reveals that she reported that her two scars on the right breast felt uncomfortable when her bra pressed or rubbed on them but did not indicate extreme pain and were not unstable with frequent loss of skin covering the scars.  Upon examination, the examiner reported that the two anterior trunk scars were well healed, measuring approximately 3.5 by 1.5 cm for scar #1 and a barely visible 4.0 by 0.8 cm for scar #2.  The scars were slightly tender on palpitation.  Notably, the examiner expressed conflicting findings regarding whether the scars were with or without underlying tissue damage, as a negative response was indicated for both circumstances.

As noted previously, in a May 2023 rating decision the AOJ proposed to decrease the disability rating for the Veteran's anterior trunk scars from 10 percent to a noncompensable evaluation.  The AOJ explained that the April 2023 VA examination showed improvement and that the disability no longer met the criteria for a 10 percent rating based on scars being painful and unstable.  

In a May 2023 lay statement, the Veteran asserted that her service-connected scars had not improved, with it affecting her quality of life on a daily basis because she experiences extreme pain when any undergarment touches her scars.  See May 2023 Statement in Support of the Claim, VA Form 21-4138.  The Veteran explained that she has tried various measures to ease the pain, to include applying first aid pads and bubble wrap, and reported the issue to providers but been told there is nothing that can be done for her scars.  Id.

The July 2023 rating decision reduced the rating for scars.  the AOJ essentially analyzed the issue of the reduction of the 50 percent disability rating in the same manner as it would analyze a claim for an increased disability rating.  The analysis focused on the findings of the April 2023 examination, noting the size and location of the scars, in addition to them not being associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  However, the AOJ did not address whether there was an improvement in the disability or whether such improvement resulted in an "actual in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work."  Faust, 13 Vet. App. at 350.  

The Board finds the reduction of the disability rating for the Veteran's anterior trunk scars from 10 percent to a noncompensable evaluation was not proper.  The burden of proof is on VA to establish that a reduction is warranted.  Here, the AOJ did not put forth any explanation to show that the Veteran's scar disability had improved under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  Moreover, the examination report shows the Veteran reported her scars were uncomfortable due to pressure from her bra, and the examiner noted tenderness with palpitation.  Where a rating reduction was made without observance of law, the reduction must be vacated, and the prior rating restored.  See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991); Stern v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 51 (2021).  

Based on above, the 10 percent rating assigned for disability rating assigned for anterior trunk scars must be restored, effective October 1, 2023.  Notably, as restoration is warranted due to the error noted above, it is not necessary to address, from an evidentiary standpoint, the actual merits of the reduction.

REASON FOR REMAND

The Veteran seeks a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for her service-connected anterior trunk scars.  See January 2023 VA Form 21-526 EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.

As previously discussed, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in April 2023 to assess the nature and severity of her anterior trunk scars.  Unfortunately, the Board finds the examination is inadequate for adjudication purposes, as the examiner expressed conflicting findings on whether the scars were with or without underlying tissue damage; specifically, the examiner indicated a negative response in both circumstances.  Thus, the severity of the Veteran's service-connected anterior trunk scars disability remains unclear for the period on appeal.

When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  The Board therefore finds that the AOJ's failure to ensure the adequacy of the April 2023 VA examination prior to adjudicating the claim is a pre-decisional error in the duty to assist that must be corrected on remand.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination to evaluate the nature and severity of her service-connected anterior trunk scars for the period on appeal prior to October 1, 2023.  The examiner should review the entire claims file and include a discussion of the Veteran's documented history and pertinent lay statements.  The examiner should report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluation of the scar disability under the rating criteria.
