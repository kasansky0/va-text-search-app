DOCKET NO. 240617-520362
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

The June 17, 2024, request for an extension of time to file an appeal from a rating decision issued on June 28, 2022, that granted service connection for hypothyroidism and assigned an initial noncompensable rating effective January 1, 2021, is denied, and the attempted appeal is therefore dismissed.  

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not timely file a Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182) with respect to the rating decision issued on June 28, 2022, that granted service connection for hypothyroidism and assigned an initial noncompensable rating effective January 1, 2021, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The June 17, 2024, Board Appeal request is not timely with respect to the rating decision issued on June 28, 2022, that granted service connection for hypothyroidism and assigned an initial noncompensable rating effective January 1, 2021, and the criteria for an extension of time to file a Board Appeal request have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 3.2500(b), 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1968 to March 1970. The Veteran filed a June 17, 2024 Board Appeal request seeking to appeal a June 28, 2022 rating decision and selecting the Direct Review docket.

Timeliness of an Appeal

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an appeal consists of a properly completed NOD on the form prescribed by the Secretary submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(b)(1)(A); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.2500(a)(1), 20.202, 20.203. A question as to the timeliness or adequacy of an NOD shall be decided by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C). 

An extension of the period for filing an NOD may be granted for good cause. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Id. When an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38?C.F.R. §?3.109(b). Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). 

Examples of good cause may include serious illness or injury of the appellant or representative, or the appellant's inability to access mail services due to homelessness, or overseas deployment. Examples that would not constitute good cause include change in representation, change in preference of a review option at the AOJ or among the Board review options, difficulty in obtaining evidence, or discovery of new evidence during a period in which the duty to assist does not apply. 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 155 (Jan. 18, 2019).

Timeliness of the June 17, 2024, Board Appeal request with respect to the rating decision issued on June 28, 2022.

On June 17, 2024, the Veteran filed a Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the rating decision issued on June 28, 2022, that granted service connection for hypothyroidism and assigned an initial noncompensable rating effective January 1, 2021. The Veteran asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal. Specifically, the Veteran asserts that he disagrees with the 0 percent evaluation for his hypothyroidism, that he has required treatment since 2004 and has required frequent medication adjustments, and that he is a 75-year-old Veteran and believes that his medical issues are a direct consequence of his Agent Orange exposure. See June 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement.

For the reasons explained below, the Board concludes that the attempted appeal was not timely and good cause has not been presented to warrant an extension of time to file an appeal from the rating decision issued on June 28, 2022. 

The rating decision issued on June 28, 2022, granted service connection for hypothyroidism and assigned an initial noncompensable rating effective January 1, 2021. The Veteran and the Veteran's representative were notified of the decision in a letter that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letter was sent to the Veteran's address of record and was not returned as undeliverable.

The Veteran's June 17, 2024 NOD was not timely filed because it was received more than one year after the rating decision issued on June 28, 2022.  

The Veteran's above-listed assertions do not constitute good cause warranting an extension of time to file his appeal. Rather, the Veteran's assertions speak to the merits of the assigned disability evaluation for his hypothyroidism. Unfortunately, his assertions do not explain why he could not file an appeal during the one year following the rating decision issued on June 28, 2022, nor why his appeal could not have been filed sooner than it was. The record shows that the Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review request in September 2022, requesting review of a different issue that was adjudicated in the rating decision issued on June 28, 2022, bilateral thyroid eye disease, but did not include hypothyroidism in that request. 

Accordingly, the June 17, 2024 Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to the rating decision issued on June 28, 2022, that granted service connection for hypothyroidism and assigned an initial noncompensable rating effective January 1, 2021, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. The extension request is denied and the attempted appeal is dismissed.
