ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a gallbladder condition, diagnosed as status post cholecystectomy with residual gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's current gallbladder condition, diagnosed as status post cholecystectomy with residual GERD, was incurred in active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a gallbladder condition, diagnosed as status post cholecystectomy with residual GERD, were met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303 (2022).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Air Force from July 1970 to July 1990.  He received the National Defense Service Medal and the Vietnam Service Medal, among other decorations and medals.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In May 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), electing the Direct Review docket.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The issue on appeal was previously adjudicated in August 2014 and January 2023 AOJ rating decisions.  As the April 2024 rating decision on appeal addressed the merits of the service connection claim, the Board finds that the AOJ implicitly determined that new and relevant evidence had been submitted.  The Board will not disturb that favorable finding and will proceed with a review of the merits of the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801(a).

Entitlement to service connection for a gallbladder condition, diagnosed as status post cholecystectomy with residual GERD

The Veteran seeks service connection for a gallbladder condition.  He contends that he first experienced abdominal pain and stomach cramps while on active duty, and that these symptoms persisted until he was finally diagnosed with gallstones and underwent a cholecystectomy in April 2007, after which he experienced recurrent GERD. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a link between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 293 (2013).

Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

As to the current disability element, the Veteran received VA Compensation and Pension (C&P) examinations in May 2014 and April 2024.  The reports from these examinations note a history of gallstones with a cholecystectomy performed in April 2007, with resulting GERD.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the current disability element is satisfied.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

As to in-service incurrence, the Veteran's service treatment records establish that he was treated for these symptoms throughout his period of active duty.  Records from December 1975, January 1976, January 1977, November 1979, and December 1980 note the Veteran's reports of these and similar symptoms (the records do not respect any specific diagnoses).  The Veteran has also provided lay reports of stomach and abdominal pain beginning in service.  The in-service incurrence element is satisfied.  See id.

As to the third element, the crucial question of a nexus to service, the Veteran was afforded VA examinations pertaining to his claim in May 2014 and April 2024; both examiners provided ostensibly negative nexus opinions.

After careful review, however, the Board finds that there is sufficient lay and medical evidence to support a finding of nexus in this matter.  As noted, there is credible lay and medical evidence of stomach and abdominal pain which first developed in service and persisted thereafter.  Additionally, the Board notes that the April 2024 VA examiner's negative nexus opinion does not address whether the claimed gallbladder condition was incurred in or otherwise related to the Veteran's documented in-service symptoms.  (The basis for the examiner's negative finding was that the claimed condition was unrelated to the Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents.)  Indeed, the examiner's rationale seems to actually support the Veteran's theory of direct service connection, as the examiner explained that the Veteran reported for treatment for abdominal pain in January 1976 and ultimately presented to the emergency room in 2007 "with complaints of abdominal pain for several years."  The examiner then seemingly linked the Veteran's gallbladder issues to his "longstanding postprandial abdominal pain."  (The May 2014 VA examiner's opinion is conclusory and therefore inadequate to support a decision.)

Based on the above evidence, the Board finds that all three elements of service connection are satisfied.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  The Veteran is competent to report matters which he personally observed or experienced, as well as what has been related to him by medical professionals.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Moreover, his service treatment records corroborate his reports of recurring stomach and abdominal pain in service, of uncertain etiology.  A medical expert thereafter suggested that there was a likelihood that the Veteran's in-service symptoms were manifestations of gallbladder issues.  The lay and medical evidence of continuous symptoms since service, up to the April 2007 cholecystectomy, have not been persuasively rebutted.

In sum, the Board finds that the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements and service treatment records, which establish in-service onset and continuous symptoms since service, coupled with the VA examiner's acknowledgement of at least the possibility of a nexus to service, establish the necessary elements of service connection.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  The Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a gallbladder condition, diagnosed as status post cholecystectomy with residual GERD, is granted.
