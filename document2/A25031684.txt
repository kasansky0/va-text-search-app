DOCKET NO. 240326-426386
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for allergic rhinitis is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis has not been manifested by polyps.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for rhinitis are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from December 2006 to December 2012.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. The March 2024 rating decision was a Higher-Level Review of a previous February 2024 rating decision.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

The Board notes that the March 2024 rating decision on appeal assigned an earlier effective date of October 25, 2023, for the award of service connection for rhinitis, as well as an increased rating of 10 percent. The March 2024 VA Form 10182 only expressed disagreement with the rating assigned; therefore, the Board will not address the assigned effective date.

Analysis

The Veteran seeks a higher rating for his service-connected rhinitis, which is currently assigned a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6522. 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part IV.  If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Under Diagnostic Code 6522, a 10 percent rating is assigned for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. The highest rating of 30 percent is assigned for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

The Veteran submitted a Sinusitis/Rhinitis and other Conditions of the Nose, Throat, Larynx and Pharynx Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) in October 2023, completed by private provider Dr. J.M., who noted a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. The Veteran described a history of ongoing allergic rhinitis and sinus congestion. It was noted that the Veteran had greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides due to rhinitis, but not complete obstruction of either side. There was permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, but no evidence of nasal polyps. There was no evidence of rhinoscleroma. No other physical findings were noted. Dr. J.M. noted that during flare-ups of his sinus symptoms, the Veteran experienced migraines.

After a review of the evidence, the Board must conclude that a rating in excess of the currently assigned 10 percent is not warranted. The October 2023 DBQ specifically notes that the Veteran did not experience polyps, which is required for a higher rating under Diagnostic Code 6522. 

To the extent that Dr. J.M. noted permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, which is a symptom contemplated by Diagnostic Code 6523, for bacterial rhinitis, the Board notes that permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates also warrants a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6523. As such, it does not avail the Veteran to rate his disability under that Code. Indeed, to obtain a higher, 50 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6523, the evidence would need to show the presence of rhinoscleroma, which was specifically not noted in the October 2023 DBQ.

VA treatment records do not document nasal polyps or any other symptoms warranting a higher rating, and the Veteran has not disputed the assessment rendered by Dr. J.M. in the October 2023 DBQ; indeed, the Veteran himself submitted that DBQ.

Finally, to the extent that the October 2023 DBQ reflects that the Veteran's rhinitis causes migraines, the Board notes that the Veteran is separately service-connected for migraines.

In sum, the most persuasive evidence is against the claim, and the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for rhinitis must be denied.
