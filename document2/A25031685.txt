REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a lower back disability, to include as secondary to bilateral knee strain and chondromalacia, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1997 to September 2000.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2022 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for musculoskeletal strain lumbar spine (claimed as lower back), any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

As a final preliminary matter, the Veteran's VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) was received in June 2022. In May 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-22a appointing R.L. as his new representative, well beyond 90 days after certification. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304 requires a showing of good cause for a change in representation in excess of 90 days following NOD. Upon review, the Board finds that no good cause has been shown to change representation. Therefore, the proper representation before the Board in the present appeal is still Texas Veterans Commission. See August 2021 VA Form 21-22.  The AOJ may accept the change in representation while on remand.

The Veteran contends that his lower back disability is related to service. See June 2001 VA 21-526, Veterans Application for Compensation; October 2021 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application. Specifically, the Veteran asserts that his lower back disability was caused or aggravated on a secondary basis by severe alterations in his gait which are related to his service-connected right and left knee disabilities. See June 2022 VA Form 10182 NOD.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Specifically, remand is necessary in this case to obtain an adequate medical opinion. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007) (noting that an opinion is adequate where it is based upon consideration of the veteran's prior medical history and examinations).

To assess the nature and cause of the Veteran's lower back disability, he was afforded a VA examination in July 2004. The examiner noted that the Veteran attributes his lower back condition to his bilateral knee discomfort. During the examination, the Veteran reported experiencing soreness a couple of times per month, usually triggered by prolonged standing for more than half an hour or walking distances greater than 500 yards. When symptomatic, his lower back soreness lasts for up to three days on average, and he manages the discomfort with 800 mg of ibuprofen per day, which provides some relief. The examiner also noted that the Veteran's C-file does not indicate a history of chief complaints related to low back pain. Physical examinations conducted in January 1997, March 1999, and May 2000 all showed normal spine. The examiner reported recurrent musculoskeletal strains of the lumbar spine but found no range of motion (ROM) limitations attributable to pain, fatigability, lack of endurance, or incoordination. While the condition is uncomfortable when symptomatic, the examiner concluded that it is only mildly disabling when present.

Here, the Board finds that the July 2004 examiner's opinion is inadequate to resolve the claim for service connection. First, the opinion fails to adequately address the Veteran's documented in-service complaints of back pain. The examiner stated that the Veteran's C-file did not indicate chief complaints of low back pain, yet service treatment records (STRs) contradict this assertion. Specifically, the Veteran reported recurrent back pain in the March 1999 and May 2000 reports of medical history, and the August 2000 record notes low back pain with bending and an inability to touch his toes due to pain. See June 2001 Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility; June 2001 STR - Medical. 

Second, the examiner did not provide a sufficient rationale regarding secondary service connection. The Veteran contends, and the examiner acknowledged, that his lower back condition is related to his service-connected bilateral knee strain. However, the examiner's opinion does not analyze whether the altered gait or biomechanics resulting from the knee disability could have caused or aggravated the Veteran's lower back condition. Instead, the examiner merely described the Veteran's symptoms without addressing the key medical question of causation or aggravation. El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 138-40 (2013) (a medical opinion regarding secondary service connection must address both causation and aggravation to be adequate). 

Third, as mentioned above, the Board notes that the Veteran's STRs contain notations of treatment for the back. See June 2001 Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility; June 2001 STR - Medical. Although the Veteran has focused his contentions on a secondary theory of service connection, as the McLendon elements had been met prior to the issuance of the February 2022 rating decision, remand is also required to obtain an opinion on direct service connection that considers the in-service treatment for the back. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). The July 2004 VA opinion is unclear regarding direct service connection. While the examiner noted recurrent musculoskeletal strains of the lumbar spine, the examiner did not provide a clear nexus opinion linking or ruling out a connection to service. The opinion is incomplete and inadequate for adjudicating direct service connection. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its being factually accurate, fully articulated, and having a sound reasoning for the conclusion).

Finally, no additional VA examinations or medical opinions have been provided to the Veteran since the inadequate July 2004 VA opinion. Given the passage of time and the presence of new medical evidence, an updated medical evaluation is essential to properly assess the nature and etiology of the Veteran's lower back condition. See Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121, 124 (1991) (VA has a duty to provide veterans with a thorough and contemporaneous medical examination); Caffrey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 377, 381 (1994) (an examination too remote for rating purposes cannot be considered "contemporaneous"). In March 2017, the AOJ denied the Veteran's lower back disability claim on the basis of no diagnosis. See March 2017 Rating Decision. However, subsequent medical evidence contradicts this finding. A May 2017 private medical record documented a diagnosis of segmental/somatic dysfunction of the lumbar region and a February 2021 private medical record further assessed the Veteran with spondylolisthesis of the lumbar region, lumbar foraminal stenosis, and low back pain. See October 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. Notably, a February 2022 rating decision made a favorable finding that the Veteran has a current back disability, specifically lumbar pain with segmental dysfunction, considering the private treatment records. The acknowledgment of a current disability further necessitates an updated medical opinion to determine whether the disability is linked to service or cause/aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected bilateral knee strain. 

Accordingly, the Board must remand the Veteran's service connection claim for a lower back disability to obtain an adequate opinion on direct and secondary service connection. The failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion prior to the February 2022 rating decision constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error warranting a remand. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the nature and etiology of the claimed lower back disability. The claims file must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner. Based on the examination results and review of the record, the examiner is requested to provide opinion on the following:

(a)	Please provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's lower back disability had its onset during the Veteran's active service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. The examiner is directed to consider all pertinent evidence, including but not limited to, the Veteran's report of recurrent back pain in the March 1999 and May 2000 reports of medical history, and the August 2000 STR noting low back pain with bending and an inability to touch his toes due to pain. See June 2001 Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility; June 2001 STR - Medical.

(b)	Provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's lower back disability was caused or aggravated by his service-connected bilateral knee disabilities. Please provide separate rationales for both secondary causation and aggravation.

The examiner must provide a comprehensive report including a clearly stated rationale for any opinions offered and conclusions reached, citing the objective medical findings leading to the conclusions, and must not be based solely on the lack of records. 

In this regard, the Board emphasizes that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history, and such statements by the Veteran regarding symptomatology and medical history must be specifically acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinions concerning the onset and severity of his disability. If such reports are rejected by the examiner, a reason for doing so must be provided.
