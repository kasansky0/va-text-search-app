ORDER

Service connection for right knee chondromalacia and degenerative arthritis status post meniscal tear, hereinafter, right knee disability, is granted.

Service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis status post meniscal tear, hereinafter, left knee disability, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's right knee disability (claimed as right knee injury, pain, and residuals) is related to her active service due to an injury that occurred in the line of duty during training.

2. The Veteran's left knee disability (claimed as left knee injury, pain, and residuals) is related to her active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for service connection for a right knee disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for service connection for a left knee disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2009 to February 2010 and from July 2013 to November 2014.  The Veteran had additional service in the Army National Guard with periods of active duty for training (ACDUTRA), including in January 2009, and inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA).

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  In that decision, the RO denied service connection for right knee chondromalacia and degenerative arthritis status post meniscal tear and for left knee degenerative arthritis status post meniscal tear.

In July 2024, VA received the Veteran's 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD). The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The Direct Review docket does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Thus, as this is a Direct Review appeal, the record closed as of the May 2024 rating decision.

Evidence added during an ineligible period will not be considered.  Should the Veteran want VA to consider evidence submitted outside the eligible period, the Veteran should submit a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, identifying such evidence.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  "To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"- the so-called "nexus" requirement."  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection for certain chronic diseases may also be established based upon a legal "presumption" by showing that the disease manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. In addition, service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after service when all the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected condition.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

For veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, including arthritis and organic diseases of the nervous system, are presumed to have been incurred in service if manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Alternatively, service connection may also be granted for chronic conditions that have manifested continuous symptomology since separation of service.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Additionally, when a claim for service connection is based only on a period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA, there must be evidence that the appellant became disabled as a result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during that period of ACDUTRA or disabled as a result of an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during that period of INACDUTRA for service connection to be granted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (2), (22), (24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a); Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167, 172 (2010); Acciola v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 320, 324 (2008).  In the absence of such evidence, the period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA would not qualify as "active military, naval, or air service," and the appellant would not receive "veteran" status for that period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA service alone.  38 U.S.C. § 101 (2), (24); Acciola, 22 Vet. App. at 324.

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability

The Veteran contends that her right knee disability occurred during a training exercise during a period of ACDUTRA in January 2009.  She further asserts that, due to compensating for her right knee pain, she began experiencing left knee pain.  The Veteran asserts that her right and left knee pain has been continuous since her active service.  See August 26, 2024, Appellate Brief.

The Veteran first filed a claim regarding her knees in 2010, within 12 months of the in-service injury.  The Veteran contends that her 2010 filing as well as the lay evidence of record, establishes chronicity of her service injury to her current condition.  She also asserts that she first injured her knees while at Fort Jackson and Fort Leonard Wood, and that since then, her conditions have worsened.  See July 2, 2024, VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim; see also January 19, 2010, VA 21-526 Veterans Application for Compensation.

The Veteran has received treatment from a private medical provider as well as VA.  From 2010 to 2019, she did not receive treatment for her injury, because she could not afford it, but her pain never went away.  See November 16, 2023, VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim; see also April 27, 2022, VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

The Veteran's mother, brother, and friend each submitted statements supporting the Veteran's assertions.  She did not have any issues prior to service, but that since the incident occurred during her training for deployment, she has consistently discussed the condition of her knees and how much they have worsened.  Her knee disabilities still affect her to this day, but she does her best to push through the pain.  Prior to service the Veteran was extremely athletic and physically fit, but since service her knee disabilities have slowed her down, and she is no longer able to participate in activities she used to enjoy.  After her deployment, the Veteran sought medical treatment from VA, but her assertions were not taken seriously.  The Veteran experienced financial hardship through the years and was not able to consistently pursue medical attention due to the financial constraints.  See November 16, 2023, Buddy/Lay Statement; see also November 16, 2023, Buddy/Lay Statement; November 16, 2023, Buddy/Lay Statement.

Notably, as the Veteran's military personnel records show that the Veteran sustained a right knee injury in the line of duty in January 2009, and that the Veteran was on ACDUTRA at the time, "veteran" status is established for this time. 

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence of CUE.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The RO provided favorable findings in the August 2023 and May 2024 rating decisions regarding the Veteran's right and left knee disabilities.  Participation in a toxic exposure risk activity was conceded.  The Veteran's DD-214 shows service in Iraq from April 2009 to January 2010.  The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during her service.  STRs show right knee pain and treatment in 2009 for a right knee sprain.  The record shows diagnoses of bilateral knee sprain, and, per the May 2024 VA examination, diagnoses of right knee chondromalacia and right and left knee degenerative arthritis status post meniscal tear.

The Veteran suffered a right knee sprain injury in January 2009, according to a Statement of Medical Examination and Duty Status.  The medical opinion was that the injury was incurred in line of duty.  At the time of the injury, the Veteran was on active duty for training, which began on January 9, 2009, and ended on January 30, 2009.  The Veteran twisted her right knee while training on January 20, 2009.  A July 3, 2019, record shows that she had a physical profile for left knee pain/injury.  See June 15, 2023, Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility; see also June 24, 2022, STR.

VA treatment records include a February 15, 2010, C&P Examination note, regarding her right knee disability.  The Veteran injured her right knee in January 2009 when she heard her kneecap pop.  Since that time, the Veteran has reported pain primarily under the kneecap and over the lateral kneecap, especially when crossing her legs.  The knee pops a lot, and it hurts to bend it.  Pain increases with activity but is often worse at rest; it is not located at joint lines.  The records show continued treatment for her knees again in 2023.  See November 27, 2023, CAPRI. 

Private medical records show treatment and complaints related to the Veteran's left and right knee disabilities, as well as record of physical therapy.  During a July 24, 2019, office visit for followup of complaints of the left knee, the Veteran reported overall that her knee pain had improved but still had random episodes of sharp pain.  An August 15, 2019, physical therapy discharge report shows that the Veteran reported bilateral knee pain, left worse than right, likely patella femoral syndrome in nature, with positive signs for fat pad irritation.  See November 16, 2023, Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

The Veteran underwent a June 2022 VA examination for her knee disability.  The examiner noted a diagnosis of left knee strain, with an onset date of 2009.  The Veteran reported falling on her knees from a standing position during a 4 man lift in training.  She reported to sick call and was placed on light duty.  Current symptoms were intermittent sharp pain at the base of the patella that radiates up both sides as well as flare-ups.  The Veteran described functional loss/impairment as decreased ability to kneel and squat, difficulty sitting on the floor, and pain with prolonged standing and walking more than 1/4 mile.  See June 30, 2022, C&P Examination.  The June 2022 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner's rationale was that no chronic diagnosis was made for injury and pain to left knee and residuals.  The objective examination was normal, and symptoms were subjective only.  See June 30, 2022, C&P Examination.

In an August 2022 addendum opinion, the examiner stated that the documentation of the knee examination was of the Veteran's subjective symptoms related to her left knee.  Upon physical examination the Veteran had full knee range of motion without pain, and there were no complaints of pain with palpation of the knee nor with repetitive movement and stability testing of the joint.  The examiner stated that the record was silent for a left knee contention but that multiple STRs noted right knee pain.  Based on the information available, the examiner was unable to determine that a left knee condition occurred during the time frame of military service or post service.  The examiner found that there was not sufficient physical evidence to support the Veteran's symptoms of pain and decreased range of motion.  Therefore, the examiner opined that it is less than likely that the Veteran's left knee strain was related to service due to training at Fort Jackson, Leonard Wood, or Camp Blanding.  See August 30, 2022, C&P Examination. 

The July 2023 VA examination provides a diagnosis of bilateral knee strain with onset date noted as 2009, while in training.  Since that injury, the Veteran favored her right knee and caused significant pain to the left knee.  Current symptoms were stabbing, stinging, and knife-like pain to both knees, as well as flare-ups; pain was exhibited on flexion and extension.  Due to her knee disabilities, the Veteran has to take caution with bending, crouching, and kneeling, has to limit how far she can walk and how long she can stand, and has to avoid flights of stairs.  See July 23, 2023, C&P Examination.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's right knee disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner's rationale was that the Veteran had right knee pain in January 2009, after twisting it while turning; she was diagnosed with right knee sprain.  X-rays of the right and left knees were normal in 2023.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's left knee disability is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's right knee disability.  The examiner's rationale was that the left knee pain is not likely due to right knee, as no chronicity is shown for either knee, noting that there were no complaints for 13 years.  See July 23, 2023, C&P Examination. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in May 2024.  The date of onset of the Veteran's right knee disability was noted as January 22, 2009; she was later deployed, despite knee pain.  Since onset, she has pushed through her right knee pain during deployment, putting more weight onto the left knee.  She reported seeking treatment at VA clinic/hospital for her knee but that she was not taken seriously.  The Veteran's current symptoms were noted as "intermittent times with no pain in both knees" and that she has to have a pillow behind both knees in bed, and she cannot bend severely due to pain.  The Veteran has pain (after sitting 2-5 minutes), intermittent swelling, bilateral stiffness after sitting, and bilateral knee popping, cracking, locking, and buckling.  See May 10, 2024, C&P Examination. 

The May 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's right knee disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner's rationale was that review of the record shows evidence of a right knee injury while training at Camp Blanding in January 2009, prior to deployment.  The examiner noted that it was prior to active duty dates listed on the Veteran's DD 214 but that there was evidence that it was "in the line of duty."  The examiner noted that imaging of the knee was not conducted at the time of injury, but the Veteran was deployed, with no evidence of an inability to carry out deployment duties.  In 2010, the Veteran had an x-ray related to a VA examination where a "possible" loose body was noted in the right knee.  

In 2024, an MRI of her right knee did not mention loose body.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had a meniscal tear but that it does not mean that it was in pieces and loose from the rest of the meniscus.  The examiner provided a review of medical literature regarding intra-articular loose bodies and the origin of physiological noise.  The examiner stated that the evidence is not robust to prove that there was a chronic loose body in the right knee related to the injury in January 2009 or a loose body in subsequent imaging.  The 2024 MRI of the right knee does not indicate a loose body.  The examiner explained that medical literature shows that popping can have multiple causes, and that the evidence of a loose body is less than certain.  Catching and locking would be a symptom of a loose body, but the record does not show chronic locking or catching, which are different than popping.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's right knee loose body (diagnosed as right knee meniscal tear, chondromalacia, and degenerative arthritis) is less likely than not incurred in or caused by spraining right knee while training on January 20, 2009, during service.  See May 10, 2024, C&P Examination. 

The Board affords low probative value to the June 2022, July 2023, May 2024 VA opinions, as well as the August 2022 addendum, regarding the etiology of the Veteran's right and left knee disabilities.  Each of the VA examiners either failed to sufficiently address the Veteran's assertions, including that she has had knee pain ever since service, or disregarded subjective reports of symptoms.  The VA examiners focused on objective evidence of record without providing any reasoning for their apparent opinions that subjective reports of symptoms were not useful.  The examiners discounted the Veteran's assertions of continuous pain since service, and determined, based on a lack of medical evidence, that there was no chronicity of care.  The Board notes that a lack of medical treatment since service is an impermissible reason to conclude that the Veteran's disabilities were not related to her service.  Moreover, the VA examiners did not provide any other possible cause of the Veteran's right or left knee disabilities.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the VA opinions are insufficient for rating purposes. 

The Board affords high probative value to the lay evidence of record, including statements from the Veteran, her mother, her brother, and her friend.  Throughout the appeal period, the lay statements show that the Veteran has experienced continuous right and left knee pain ever since her active service, including the line of duty right knee injury.  The evidence is in relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran has experienced right and left knee disabilities continuously since service, "for lay persons are competent to report observable physical conditions," and the Board finds her credible.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). 

Additionally, the Veteran's contentions concerning the onset and continuity of her symptoms are credible because her assertions are supported by the evidence of record, including both lay and medical evidence.  The Veteran filed a claim for her knee condition in January 2010, within a year of the in-service incident, and the February 2010 VA examination shows that the Veteran had been experiencing knee pain since the January 2009 incident.  The Board acknowledges the lack of medical records documenting right or left knee pain; however, the absence of medical evidence is not proof that the Veteran did not experience continuous symptoms of a knee disability.  The Veteran has asserted that she was unable to seek treatment at that time due to financial constraints, and that she rather pushed through the pain.  The Board finds it reasonable to believe that even though the Veteran was experiencing knee pain, she may not have felt she needed medical treatment at that time, especially considering her financial constraints.  Notably, the lay evidence of record supports the Veteran's assertion that her right and left knee pain has been constant since the in-service injury and continues to this day.  Thus, the Board assigns high probative value to the competent and credible lay statements of record, describing continuous symptomatology, consistent with the available post-service evidence of record.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("[N]othing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] require both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself").  

Here, the Veteran's STRs show that the Veteran injured her right knee in a January 2009 line of duty incident.  The Board finds it reasonable to believe that the Veteran began compensating for her injured knee after the January 2009 incident and that she eventually experienced pain in the other knee as a result.  The record, including medical and lay evidence, shows that the Veteran has diagnosed right and left knee disabilities, has reported current complaints, and that her right and left knee pain has existed ever since her active service.  In light of the above, the Board finds that the evidence establishes that symptoms of the Veteran's right and left knee disabilities have continued from an applicable service period to the present. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current right and left knee disabilities are related to her active service.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for right and left knee disabilities is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided.  This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
