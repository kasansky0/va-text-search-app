ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for pelvic floor dysfunction with hip pain has been withdrawn.

FINDING OF FACT

In a September 2024 communication, prior to the promulgation of a decision of the appeal, the Veteran explicitly and unambiguously stated he sought to withdraw his pending appeal, regarding his claim for entitlement to service connection for pelvic floor dysfunction with hip pain.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to service connection for pelvic floor dysfunction with hip pain by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 19.55.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2012 to February 2017. 

The matter comes before the Board on appeal from a rating decision issued in June 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. In September 2024, the Veteran withdrew his claim and request for a Board hearing. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative upon receipt of the withdrawal or within 90 days following. 38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a).

Entitlement to service connection for pelvic floor dysfunction with hip pain.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.55. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. Id. 

In the present case, on September 2024 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran wrote that he wishes to withdraw his pending appeal that he filed on June 24, 2024. Thus, there remains no allegations of error or law for appellate consideration with regard to this claim. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
