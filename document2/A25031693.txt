ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date than January 2, 2024, for the award of entitlement to service connection for a scar of the left third finger is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The persuasive weight of the evidence is in support of a finding that the Veteran was denied entitlement to service connection for a finger disability in a December 2018 rating decision; he did not timely perfect an appeal of the December 2018 rating decision and it therefore became final; he properly submitted an intent to file on January 2, 2024; later in January 2024 he submitted a claim for entitlement to service connection for chronic pain of the finger; he was granted entitlement to service connection for a scar of the left third finger in an April 2024 rating decision; and there was no claim, or written intent to file a claim, for entitlement to service connection for a finger disability submitted between the December 2018 rating decision and the January 2, 2024, intent to file.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than January 2, 2024, for the grant of service connection for a scar of the left third finger have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from September 1999 to September 2003.

This matter is on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of the decision. The Veteran then filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) later in April 2024 in which the Veteran elected the Direct Review option. Accordingly, this decision has been written consistent with the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) framework.

In this case, the Board of Veterans' Appeals' (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, which is dated April 2, 2024. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision. Id. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date than January 2, 2024, for the award of entitlement to service connection for a scar of the left third finger.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran asserted that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than January 2, 2024, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for a scar of the left third finger. See April 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. Specifically, the Veteran argued that he had "filed a claim for the same issue in 2018, and was denied." Id.

The statutory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110. The effective date of an award based on an initial claim of compensation is either the day following separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, it will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b). This includes original claims, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase (as described under the legacy appeal system) and initial or supplemental claims (as described under the AMA). Id. 

A rating decision is considered final if an appeal is not perfected within one year of the notification of the decision. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160, 20.201, 20.302. However, under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b), new and material evidence received during the appeal period after a decision issued under the legacy system will serve to preclude that decision from becoming final unless the decision is reconsidered. See Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (holding that, in determining whether a decision became final, VA is required to determine whether any evidence received within one year of the decision is new and material and prevented the decision from becoming final under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b)).

Under the AMA, which became effective in February 2019, a determination on a claim by the AOJ becomes final unless the claimant continuously pursues the claim by filing a supplemental claim, a request for higher-level review, or an appeal to the Board within one year of the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1103, 3.2500(c)(1). If a claimant continuously pursues an issue by filing one of these administrative review options within one year, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). 

The term "date entitlement arose" is not specifically defined in the current statute or regulation. The Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. This is determined on a "facts found" basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

The Board is mindful that technical precision is not required in identifying the benefit sought. See Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 256-57 (2007). A claimant may identify the benefit sought by referring to a body part or system that is disabled or by describing symptoms of the disability. See Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 86-87 (2009); see also Grimes v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 84 (2021) (holding that "a claim for service connection may encompass a related condition that is initially referenced by the claimant but not diagnosed until later in the appeal stream").

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. Prior to March 24, 2015, VA recognized both formal and informal claims. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014). The amendments also, in pertinent part, eliminated the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014), codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155 (2016). The amended regulations apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

The amended regulation also allowed a claimant to submit an intent to file a claim. Id. There are three ways in which a claimant may submit an intent to file a claim: (i) saved electronic application-when an application otherwise meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) is electronically initiated and saved in a claims-submission tool with a VA web-based electronic claims application system, (ii) written intent, signed and dated on the intent to file a claim form prescribed by the Secretary, and (iii) oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel, recorded in writing, and documented in the claimant's records. Id. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, appropriate to the benefit sought, within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. Id.

While VA has an obligation to interpret a claimant's submissions broadly, VA is not required to conjure up issues not raised by claimant. VA is therefore not required to anticipate any potential claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998) (medical records cannot constitute an initial claim for service connection but rather there must be some intent by the claimant to apply for the benefit); Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995).

In September 2018, the Veteran submitted a claim of entitlement to service connection for a finger disability. See September 2018 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). The Veteran was subsequently denied service connection for a finger disability in a December 4, 2018, rating decision. See December 2018 Rating Decision - Narrative. Thereafter, the evidence of record does not include a submission by the Veteran regarding a finger disability until January 2, 2024, at which time the Veteran properly submitted an intent to file a claim. See January 2024 Intent to File Letter. Later in January 2024 the Veteran submitted a claim, in pertinent part, for entitlement to service connection for chronic pain due to a cut he sustained on his left third finger. See January 2024 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). In April 2024, following a review of the evidence of record, the rating decision on appeal granted entitlement to service connection for a scar of the left third finger effective January 2, 2024; the date the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim. See April 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative.

The Board has carefully reviewed the entire claims file, paying particular attention to the Veteran's submissions between December 4, 2018, and January 2, 2024. Between the December 4, 2018, rating decision which denied entitlement to service connection for a finger disability, and the January 2, 2024, claim of entitlement to service connection for chronic pain due to a left third finger laceration, none of the Veteran's correspondence discussed a finger disability. Likewise, none of the Veteran's correspondence suggested he was filing a claim for a finger disability. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran did not submit an appeal, nor was new and material evidence associated with the claims file, within a year following the December 4, 2018, rating decision. The decision therefore became final on December 4, 2019. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160, 20.201, 20.302.

The Board reiterates that, while clinical records were previously recognized, in some instances, as informal claims under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157(b) (2014), this applied only if the evidence pertained to examination or treatment of a disability for which service connection had been previously established, or when a claim specifying the benefit sought was received within one year from the date of such examination, treatment or hospital admission. The Veteran does not assert, and the evidence of record does not reflect, that either situation applies here. Moreover, effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations and eliminated the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014), codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155 (2016).

In so finding, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran argues that he is entitled to an earlier effective date than January 2, 2024, for the award of entitlement to service connection for a scar of the left third finger, as he had previously "filed a claim for the same issue in 2018, and was denied." April 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement; see also December 2018 Rating Decision - Narrative; September 2018 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). However, the Veteran may not now vitiate the finality of the December 2018 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for a finger condition by seeking an earlier effective date for his scar of the left third finger based upon an unappealed claim. See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299-300 (2006) (holding that a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date is a nullity, and the only basis for challenging the effective of a now final decision date is clear and unmistakable error). Once a decision on a claim becomes final, it cannot be challenged through a freestanding claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date. Instead, any challenge to an effective date from a final decision must be collaterally attacked through a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) claim. Id.; see also Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994). However, the Veteran has not alleged or even mentioned CUE in any of his correspondence. 

There was no pending claim, or any other correspondence, concerning the Veteran's scar of the left third finger based upon which service connection could have been granted between the December 4, 2018, rating decision which denied entitlement to service connection for a finger condition and January 2, 2024. Moreover, the Veteran did not submit an appeal, nor was new and material evidence associated with the claims file, within a year following the December 4, 2018, rating decision which therefore became final on December 4, 2019. Accordingly, while the Board sympathizes with the Veteran, the evidence and the law do not support the assignment of an effective date earlier than January 2, 2024, for the award of entitlement to service connection for a scar of the left third finger, and the appeal for an earlier effective date is therefore denied.
