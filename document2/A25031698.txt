ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection of posttraumatic stress disorder with major depressive disorder, (PTSD) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim for Compensation that was received by VA on October 28, 2022.

2. The Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ, Claim for Compensation seeking entitlement to service connection for PTSD received by VA on July 7, 2023.

3. Although the July 7, 2023, Claim for Compensation was filed within one year of the October 28, 2022, Intent to File, the Veteran had also filed an earlier Claim for Compensation on April 17, 2023, to request entitlement to service connection for multiple other disabilities, which did not include PTSD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 7, 2023, for the award of service connection for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Navy from September 2004, until February 2022.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Date 

Generally, the effective date for the grant of a benefit will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after discharge from service.  Otherwise, for an award based on an initial claim or supplemental claim, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

VA amended its adjudication regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014).

A "claim" is defined as "a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d), a complete claim is required for all types of claims and will generally be considered filed as of the date it was received by VA for an evaluation of award of benefits.

Claimants may indicate their desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file to VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  If VA then receives a complete application form, as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), within one year of receipt of the intent to file, the complete claim is considered filed as of the date of receipt of the intent to file.  Id. 

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii) also state that if VA receives a complete claim within one year of filing an intent to file that meets the requirements set forth above, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the intent to file.  The regulation goes on to provide that only one complete claim for a benefit may be associated with each intent to file for that benefit, although multiple issues may be listed within a complete claim for a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii).  In the event that multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within one year of an intent to file for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file.  Id. 

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an appellant can preserve an effective date by continuously pursuing a claim.  This is accomplished by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision (or within the time specified in § 3.2500(f), as applicable to simultaneously contested claims), provided that any appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims must be accepted as timely by that court.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the evaluation of posttraumatic stress disorder with major depressive disorder, (PTSD) is denied.

The Veteran has been assigned an effective date of July 7, 2023, for his award of service connection for PTSD. The March 2024, HLR decision, on appeal to the Board, denied entitlement to an earlier effective date for that award. It is the Veteran's continued contention, however, that the effective date should be earlier than the awarded date of July 7, 2023. For the reasons that follow, the Board finds an earlier effective date is not warranted.

Review of the record in connection with this appeal shows VA received an Intent to File indicating the Veteran's intent to file for compensation benefits on October 28, 2022.

In the one-year period following the filing of the October 28, 2022, Intent to File, the following claims (as relevant to this appeal) were received:

On February 24, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, and requested review of a claim for service connection of a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD. However, there was no prior denial of a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD.

On April 17, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits requesting service connection for blood in urine and GERD.

On July 7, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits requesting service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD.

The July 7, 2023, claim was adjudicated in a September 2023, rating decision.  The AOJ awarded service connection for PTSD and assigned an effective date of July 7, 2023, based on the date of receipt of the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ.

In the Veteran's November 2023, Request for HLR, the Veteran asserted that an earlier effective date is warranted for the award of service connection for PTSD. 

In the March 2024, HLR decision on appeal, the AOJ denied an earlier effective date for the Veteran's award of service connection for PTSD explaining that the October 2022, Intent to File could not be associated with the claim filed in July 2023, because it had already been associated with the April 17, 2023, claim for blood in urine and GERD.

After reviewing the relevant laws and regulations, however, the Board cannot agree that an earlier effective date is warranted in this matter.

To be clear, the Board acknowledges that when an active Intent to File is of record and multiple claims are subsequently received, the Intent to File should be applied to the next claim that is filed. The Veteran's February 24, 2023, HLR seeking review of a claim for PTSD, which as stated above, was not a valid claim as there was no prior claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD at the time of this HLR. This is furthered by the July 7, 2023, letter from the Veteran's representative noting that the new VA Form 21-526EZ submitted on the same day is to correct the improper form previously filed.

Therefore, in this matter, there was not an active Intent to File pending at the time of the filing of the July 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ.  As noted by the AOJ in its March 2024, HLR decision, following the filing of the October 2022, Intent to File, the Veteran also filed an April 17, 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ seeking compensation for blood in urine and GERD.  When the Veteran filed that claim, the Intent to File attached to that claim.  

Moreover, according to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(1)(ii), if VA receives a complete claim within one year of filing an Intent to File that meets the requirements of § 3.155(b), it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the Intent to File.  Additionally, if more than one complete claim for a benefit is filed within one year of an Intent to File, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim.  Id. Accordingly, any open Intent to File will be absorbed by the next valid claim that is received, even if consideration of the Intent to File is not beneficial to the effective date. 

As outlined above, the Veteran's April 2023, claim for compensation for service connection of blood in urine and GERD was the first claim received following the October 2022, Intent to File.  Therefore, the October 2022, Intent to File was not available to attach to the claim for compensation filed in July 2023, for the Veteran's PTSD.  

In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed all evidence of record whether or not discussed in detail. See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal).

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's award of service connection for PTSD was properly assigned effective from July 7, 2023, the date of receipt of his July 7, 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ, and the claim for an earlier effective date is denied.
