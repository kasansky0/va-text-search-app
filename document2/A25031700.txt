ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating for seborrheic dermatitis (previously diagnosed and evaluated as rosacea) in excess of 0 percent is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis is manifested by characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected, less than 5 percent of the entire body is affected, and no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a disability rating for seborrheic dermatitis (previously diagnosed and evaluated as rosacea) in excess of 0 percent have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.118, DC 7806.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from May 2010 to May 2014.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) under the modernized review system, or Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2023 decision.  In December 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2023 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 decision.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to a disability rating for seborrheic dermatitis (previously diagnosed and evaluated as rosacea) in excess of 0 percent is denied.

In general, disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disabilities adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set for the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. The percentage ratings represent, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability evaluations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589(1991).

In increased rating claims, where a claimant seeks a higher rating for a previously service-connected disability, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58(1994).

Here, the Veteran was initially granted service connection for seborrheic dermatitis, previously diagnosed and evaluated as rosacea, in January 2016 and given a rating of 0 percent effective May 2014. See January 2016 Rating Decision. The Veteran's disability rating for his skin condition was increased to 10 percent with an effective date of October 2018. See July 2019 Rating Decision. The Veteran's disability rating for his skin condition was then decreased to 0 percent with an effective date of November 25, 2022. See February 2023 Rating Decision. This decrease in rating did not change the Veteran's overall disability rating.

The Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7806.

Under DC 7806, as well as other specific diagnostic codes for the skin, a noncompensable rating is assigned for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.

A 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period.

A 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.

A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period. Or rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DC's 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating for the Skin for DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824.

VA regulations explicitly state that systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2022. The examination report confirms the Veteran's diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis. The Veteran stated his skin condition was treated with topical ketoconazole cream. The examiner noted that the Veteran's skin was currently clear. The Veteran had pictures of his most recent breakout, and the examiner noted that, during the Veteran's breakout, less than 5 percent of the entire body was affected and less than 5 percent of the exposed areas were affected. See November 2022 Skin Diseases Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

A review of the Veteran's medical records show the Veteran has been using a topical hydrocortisone daily on his skin. There is no indication in the records that the Veteran has had any systemic therapy. See VA Medical Records.

Based on the above, the Board finds that, throughout the review period, the manifestations of the seborrheic dermatitis most closely approximated the schedular criteria for a 0 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating for the Skin for DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824. Specifically, the VA examination documented that less than 5 percent of the entire body was affected and less than 5 percent of the exposed areas were affected, and the treatment was no more than topical. Thus, the Board denies an increased rating of greater than 0 percent throughout the review period.

A higher rating of 10 percent requires at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period.

In this case, lesions involving at least 5 percent of the entire body or 5 percent of the exposed areas are not present. The Veteran did not receive any systemic therapy o other immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, the Veteran is not entitled to a higher rating of 10 percent. Therefore, the appeal must be denied.
