CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

2. The criteria for a clothing allowance for the year 2020 for left knee brace have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1162, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.810.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2020 determination made by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the September 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2020 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

Clothing Allowance

1.  - 2.  Right and Left (Bilateral) Braces

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to clothing allowances for his bilateral knee braces because they damage his clothing.  See October 2020 VA Form 10182

Legal Criteria 

A veteran who has a service-connected disability is entitled to an annual clothing allowance if the Veteran meets certain eligibility requirements, including if the veteran, because of a service-connected disability or disabilities, wears or uses a qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance which tends to wear or tear clothing.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1).  A clothing allowance is also granted if a veteran, because of a service-connected disability or disabilities, uses skin medication that causes irreparable damage to the Veteran's clothing.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1).

Further, a veteran is entitled to two annual clothing allowances if he or she uses more than one prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, including a wheelchair, and an appliance and a medication, where each use satisfies the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1) outlined above; and together tends to wear or tear a single type of article of clothing at an increased rate of damage to the clothing due to the second appliance.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(3).

Discussion

The Veteran is in receipt of service connection for bilateral knee patellofemoral pain syndrome and uses bilateral knee braces for his disabilities.  See June 2019 Rating Decision-Codesheet.  Thus, the issue before the Board is whether his bilateral knee braces cause irreparable damage to his clothing.

The AOJ denied the clothing allowance claims for his bilateral knee braces because it determined that the Veteran's knee braces did not tend to tear and wear his clothing based on the VHA Handbook 1173.15.  See September 2020 VHA Decision.  The AOJ did not provide any explanation for its finding aside from the citation to the VHA Handbook.

The Board recognizes it is not bound by the VHA Handbook 1173.15 but may consider its guidance.  See 38 C.F.R. § 19.5 (stating that "[t]he Board is not bound by Department manuals, circulars, or similar administrative issues").  

In support of his claims, the Veteran submitted photographic evidence of the bilateral knee braces he used and asserted that the knee braces damage his clothing.  See Photographs received in October 2021.  

The Board has carefully reviewed the evidence of record and finds that the evidence supports the award of a clothing allowance for the year 2020 for the Veteran's use of a right knee brace and left knee brace.  Notably the Veteran is competent to describe whether the braces cause irreparable damage to his clothing, as this is readily observable by a lay person.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331,1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The Board finds it highly likely that the regular use of the bilateral knee braces, especially to help ambulate, tended to wear or tear the Veteran's outer garments during the 2020 calendar year.  

Here, since the Veteran wore a brace on both his right and left knees, the Board finds that two clothing allowances are warranted.  As noted above, a second clothing allowance is available for a single type of garment if a Veteran uses more than one orthopedic appliance, and the appliances meet the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.810 (a)(1) and together tend to wear or tear a single garment or irreparably damage a type of outer garment at an increased rate of damage to the clothing.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.810 (a)(3).  As the Veteran's two knee braces are for service-connected disabilities and cause wear and tear in both legs of the Veteran's pants, they cause damage at an increased rate.  Therefore, the Board finds that the criteria for two clothing allowances are met for left and right knee braces for the year of 2020.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107.
