ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for headaches, also claimed as migraines, is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's migraine disability began during active-duty service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

2. The most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's left knee disability is related to an in-service injury or disease.

3.  The most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's right knee disability is related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a migraine disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for a left knee disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for a right knee disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army National Guard from June 2011, until October 2011, with additional time in the Reserves.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2024, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the May 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service - the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In addition, service connection for certain chronic diseases, may be established on a presumptive basis by showing that the condition manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271-72 (2015).  Although the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumptive period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).

Additionally, for certain chronic diseases with potential onset during service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Qualified Periods of Service

Active duty for training includes full-time duty with the National Guard of any State under sections 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 of title 32 (32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505), or the prior corresponding provisions of law.  See 38 U.S.C. § 101(22)(b) and 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(22)(C); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(c).  Basically, this refers to the two weeks of annual training, which each Reservist or National Guardsman must perform each year.  It can also refer to the National Guardsman's initial period of training.

Inactive duty training includes service in the National Guard of any State under sections 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 of title 32 (32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505), or the prior corresponding provisions of law (including drill weekends under 32 U.S.C. § 502(a).  See 38 U.S.C. § 101(23); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (d).

Furthermore, 38 CFR § 3.6(a) provides that any period of active military, naval, and air service, including active duty for training during which the individual was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, and any period of inactive duty training during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty or from an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident, in which occurred during such training.

National Guard duty is also distinguishable from other Reserve service in that a member of the National Guard may be called to duty by the governor of his or her state. "[M]embers of the National Guard only serve the Federal military when they are formally called into the military service of the United States [and a]t all other times, National Guard members serve solely as members of the State militia under the command of a state governor."  Allen v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 54, 57 (2007).  Therefore, to have basic eligibility as a veteran based on a period of duty as a member of a state National Guard, a guardsman must have been ordered into Federal service by the President of the United States under 38 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505.  Hence, for the appellant's service in the National Guard, only periods of Federalized service are qualifying service for the purpose of VA compensation benefits.

1. Service connection for headaches, also claimed as migraines, is denied.

The Veteran asserts that her migraine disability is related to her active-duty service.

First, the Board finds that there is a current disability.  See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). The April 2024, rating decision issued by the AOJ provided a favorable finding that the April 2024. VA medical examination shows a currently diagnosed migraine disability. The Board is bound by the favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Board therefore finds that the Veteran has met the first element of service connection, a current disability.

Second, the Board finds that there was not an in-service event, injury or disease.  See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  The Veteran does not assert, nor does the record reflect an in-service onset of a migraine disability occurred.  The Veteran's STRs, do not show any complaints of a migraine disability until 2016, which is after the Veteran's active-duty service. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in April 2024, wherein the examiner provided a medical opinion concluding that the Veteran's migraine disability was less likely than not related to active-duty service. The rationale in support of this conclusion is that the Veteran's active-duty service ended in October 2011, and the first report of a migraine disability was in 2016. The examiner also notes that the 2016 report of migraines by the Veteran was related to excessive and prolonged bleeding, without another medical report of migraines until 2023.

Thus, without more, the most probative evidence is against a finding of an in-service incurrence of a migraine disability.  The second element of service connection has not been met, and an award of service connection is not warranted.  See Holton, supra.  Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for a migraine disability is denied.

In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim, the doctrine is not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

2. Service connection for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome is denied.

3. Service connection for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome is denied.

Due to the similar nature of the above left and right knee disability claim, they will both be discussed together below as a bilateral knee disability.

The Veteran asserts that her bilateral knee disability is related to her active-duty service.

First, the Board finds that there is a current disability.  See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). The April 2024, rating decision issued by the AOJ provided a favorable finding that the April 2024, VA medical examination shows a currently diagnosed bilateral knee disability. The Board is bound by the favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Board therefore finds that the Veteran has met the first element of service connection, a current disability.

Second, the Board finds that there was an in-service event, injury or disease.  See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). The April 2024, rating decision issued by the AOJ provided a favorable finding that the Veteran reported bilateral knee pain while serving on active duty. The Board is bound by the favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Board therefore finds that the Veteran has met the first element of service connection, a current disability.

However, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran's bilateral knee disability is related to active-duty service.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for her bilateral knee disability in April 2024, wherein the examiner concluded that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's bilateral knee disability was related to active-duty service. The examiner reasoned that although the Veteran complained of knee pain, it was limited to only upon running long distances and reported once, in October 2011. The Veteran's next report of knee pain was reported in October 2022, in which the Veteran reported patellar pain consistent with her recent diagnosed bilateral knee disability.

Additionally, during the examination, the Veteran reported that the current bilateral knee pain began in October 2022. The examiner ultimately found that the initial knee pain reported in October 2011, resolved and the current knee disability, which occurred approximately ten years after active-duty service, is less likely than not related to active-duty service.

The probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion that the physician reaches.  Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993).  Whether a physician provides a basis for a medical opinion goes to the weight or credibility of the evidence in the adjudication of the merits.  See Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998).  Other factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims folder and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000); Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000).

Here, the April 2024, medical opinion was provided by a VA medical professional who possesses the necessary education, training, and expertise to provide the requested opinions.  Additionally, the opinion is also shown to have been based on a review of the Veteran's record and is accompanied by a sufficient explanation as to why entitlement to service connection for a bilateral knee disability is not warranted.  Furthermore, there is no competing medical opinion of record.  The Board thus finds that the April 2024, medical opinion is dispositive of the issue at hand.

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for a bilateral knee disability is denied.

In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim, the doctrine is not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
