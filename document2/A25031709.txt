ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of August 6, 2022, but no earlier, for entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 6, 2022, but no earlier, for eligibility for Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, beginning on August 6, 2022, the Veteran's mental health disorder prevented her from securing or following substantially gainful employment.

2. Entitlement to Chapter 35 DEA benefits is established effective from August 6, 2022, the date of the grant of entitlement to a TDIU, because the Veteran has a total service-connected disability that is permanent in nature from that date.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of August 6, 2022, but no earlier, for entitlement to a TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5110, 5104B; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.523.114(a), 3.320, 3.400, 3.2400, 3.2500, 3.2501.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of August 6, 2022, but no earlier, for the establishment of basic eligibility to DEA have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3510, 5110, 5113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.807, 21.3020, 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2018 to September 2021.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 higher-level review (HLR) rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

By way of history, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a February 2024 decision through which it continued its grant of a December 23, 2022 effective date for entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU). The Veteran filed a request for HLR of that decision, see February 2024 VA Form 20-0996; the AOJ then issued the March 2024 HLR rating decision on appeal.

In a March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to an effective date of August 6, 2022, but no earlier, for entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than December 23, 2022, for entitlement to a TDIU. See June 2023 VA Form 10182. She asserts that her service-connected mental health disorder has prevented her from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation since September 1, 2021. See January 2024 Veteran Lay Statement.

Generally, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

An exception exists for increased compensation claims. Increased compensation claims include TDIU claims, which are a type of increased rating claim. See Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 420 (1999); Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b), the effective date for an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the claim is received within one year from such date. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 983 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (holding that under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b), a veteran is only entitled to an earlier effective date for an increased rating if an increase in his disability occurred during the year before he filed his claim). 

Thus, determining the appropriate effective date for an increased rating under the effective date statutes and regulations involves an analysis of the evidence to determine (1) when a claim for an increased rating was received, and, if possible, (2) when the increase in disability actually occurred. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

For purposes of effective date rules, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU may be considered as part of a claim for underlying benefits (i.e., a service connection claim) or may be considered part of an increased compensation claim (i.e., in conjunction with an increased evaluation claim or as a freestanding claim to obtain an increased evaluation based on unemployability (TDIU)). See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009). 

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran, who was separated from service based on her mental health disability, was granted service connection for her mental health disorder in a September 2021 rating decision. See September 2021 Rating Decision; see also June 2021 Service Treatment Record (STR) (indicating that the Veteran did not meet the AR 40-501 Army retention standard based on her mental health disorder). The AOJ assigned a 70 percent evaluation for the mental health disability, effective September 13, 2021, the day after the Veteran's separation from service. See id. The Veteran did not appeal this decision within one year of receiving notice, and the September 2021 decision therefore became final. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500.

In March 2023, VA issued an examination scheduling request for a routine future examination (RFE) of the Veteran's mental health disorder to assess the current level of severity; the action to reopen the mental disorder claim was taken by VA, not by the Veteran. 

In an April 2023 rating decision, the AOJ continued the 70 percent rating for the mental health disorder. See April 2023 Rating Decision. The Veteran did not appeal the April 2023 rating decision within one year of notice of the decision, and that decision therefore became final. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500.

Although the Veteran did not file an appeal during the appeal period following the April 2023 decision, VA received an intent to file form on May 4, 2023. See May 2023 VA Letter (indicating receipt of a May 4, 2023 intent to file). Later that month, the Veteran filed both a claim for increase for the mental health rating, as well as a TDIU application. See May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; see May 2023 VA Form 21-8940. 

The instant appeal arises from the May 2023 filings. See, e.g., September 2023, November 2023, January 2024, February 2024, and March 2024 Rating Decisions. Therefore, the Board concludes that the relevant date of the claim for an increased rating, i.e., the claim for entitlement to a TDIU, is May 4, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's intent to file form. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

The remaining matter for resolution is determination of the date on which the increase in disability resulting in the Veteran's unemployability actually occurred, if such determination is possible. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Total disability will be considered to exist where there is present any impairment of mind and body that is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340. "Substantially gainful employment" is employment "which is ordinarily followed by the nondisabled to earn their livelihood with earnings common to the particular occupation in the community where the veteran resides." Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991). "Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment." 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration may be given to a veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his age or to any impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19. An award of TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training. See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The ultimate question is whether a veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

Here, the AOJ assigned a December 23, 2022 effective date for the Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU, reasoning that it was the day following the last date on which the Veteran had any employment. See January 2024 Higher-Level Review (HLR) Rating Decision; see also March 2024 HLR Rating Decision.

The Board finds, however, that the evidence shows that the appropriate effective date for the Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU is August 6, 2022, the date the Veteran became too disabled to work due to her mental health disorder. See June 2023 VA Form 21-8940. 

Meticulous review of the record shows that, although the Veteran was separated from military service based on her mental health disorder, that separation was initially a temporary one subject to reevaluation. See, e.g., June 2021 STR (Informal Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) Proceedings). On March 8, 2023, after additional medical evaluation, the Veteran was removed from the Army's temporary disability retired list (TDRL) and was permanently retired from service. See March 2023 Army Memorandum; see also January 2023 TDRL Examination Report (indicating that the Veteran's mental health disorder continued to make it difficult for her to work and get along with co-workers, which decreased the likelihood of her successful return to active duty).

Prior to her reevaluation and removal from the Army's TDRL, however, the Veteran sought vocational rehabilitation assistance in the form of Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) benefits from VA. See May 2022 VA Form 28-1900. But during the pendency of her VR&E application, the Veteran obtained an overnight stocker position, and the VR&E claim was stopped. See June 2022 VA Letter; see also June 2023 VA Form 21-8940 (TDIU Application). 

The Veteran worked in the overnight stocker position for ten weeks but quit the job after a conflict with her manager. See June 2023 VA Form 21-8940 (specifying that the Veteran was employed in that position from May 27, 2022 to August 6, 2022); see also April 2023 VA Mental Disorders Examination Report. Evidence shows that the Veteran's mental health disorder results in difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or work-like settings, as well as an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. See, e.g., July 2023 VA Examination Report; see also January 2023 TDRL Examination Report. 

Based on the foregoing and resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran's mental health disorder increased such that entitlement to a TDIU effective August 6, 2022 is warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107(b), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400(o)(2), 4.3. The Veteran quit her job as an overnight stocker on that date due to a conflict with a co-worker, thereby demonstrating that she is not capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment. Because the increase in disability occurred within the one-year "look back" period prior to receipt of the Veteran's May 2023 intent to file form, an earlier effective date of August 6, 2022, is warranted. There is no earlier evidence during the one-year "look back" period that supports a TDIU effective date before August 6, 2022.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran and her representative assert that she is entitled to a September 1, 2021 TDIU effective date. See February 2024 VA Form 20-0996. The Board is bound by the statutory and regulatory requirements of law, and it is without authority to grant an effective date earlier based on the evidence of record, or on any equitable basis. 38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104; McCay v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 183, 189 (1996).

The Board therefore finds that an effective date of August 6, 2022, but no earlier, is warranted for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU, and to that extent, the appeal is granted. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c).

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 6, 2022, but no earlier, for eligibility for Dependents Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is granted.

The Veteran is currently in receipt of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 from December 23, 2022, the date she was granted entitlement to a TDIU. See March 2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet; see also January 2024 Rating Decision.

The criteria for basic eligibility to DEA benefits are met where (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a).

As a result of the Board's decision herein, the Veteran is in receipt of a TDIU based on her mental health disorder from August 6, 2022. Because the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability from that date, the schedular requirements for DEA are also met for this period. 

The Board therefore finds that an effective date of August 6, 2022, but no earlier, is warranted for the grant of entitlement to eligibility for DEA benefits. There is no reasonable doubt to be resolved as to this issue. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

Of final note, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with respect to her claim. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
