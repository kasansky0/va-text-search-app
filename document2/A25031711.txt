ORDER

Entitlement to a temporary total evaluation because of treatment and hospitalization for a service-connected condition for a period in excess of 21 days is granted, subject to the laws and regulations controlling the award of monetary benefits.

Entitlement to an effective date of August 19, 2015, for the award of an increased disability rating of 100 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is granted, subject to the regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.  

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 19, 2015, for the award of Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits, is granted, subject to controlling regulations governing the payment of monetary awards.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record reflects that the Veteran was hospitalized over 21 days for treatment for service-connected PTSD, and necessitated convalescence following treatment during the appeal period. 

2. Since August 19, 2015, the Veteran's PTSD symptoms and overall impairment have more nearly approximated total occupational and social impairment.

3. The Veteran became permanently and totally disabled for purposes of DEA benefits on August 19, 2015.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a temporary total evaluation based on hospitalization in excess of 21 days and convalescence for service-connected PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § § 3.102, 4.29, 4.30.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 19, 2015, for the award of an increased disability rating of 100 percent for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(b), 3.400.

3. From August 19, 2015, the criteria for DEA benefits have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501(a)(1), 3510; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2002 to June 2002; from January 2003 to March 2004; and from April 2010 to August 2010, to include service in Southwest Asia.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

By way of background, in a June 2024 decision, the Board, inter alia, denied the Veteran's claims on appeal. 

In a November 2024 Order, the Court granted the parties' Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR), and partially vacated the June 2024 Board decision because it found that the Board failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its determinations of fact and law. Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018). The Court remanded the matter to the Board for readjudication consistent with the JMPR.

1. Entitlement to a temporary total evaluation

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.29, a temporary total disability rating will be assigned when it is established that a service-connected disability has required hospitalization at a VA medical center or other approved hospital for more than 21 days or for hospital observation at VA expense for a service-connected disability for more than 21 days. 38 C.F.R. § 4.29.

Initially, the Board notes that under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Favorable findings in the July 2023 rating decision included hospitalization for a service-connected disability and that he was hospitalized from January 4, 2021 to February 1, 2021.

However, upon review, the Board finds that entitlement to a temporary total disability rating cannot be granted. Specifically, VA treatment records dated in February 2021 note that the Veteran was admitted into a VA hospital on January 14, 2021 for service-connected PTSD and that he was discharged from the hospital on February 1, 2021. Specifically, the VA treatment records dated February 2, 2021 indicated that the Veteran was hospitalized due to a suicide attempt and depression from January 14, 2021 through February 1, 2021. VA treatment records dated January 15, 2021 noted that the Veteran has been hospitalized due to psychiatric disorder.

Additional VA treatment records dated January 17, 2021 reflect that the Veteran continued to require inpatient psychiatric hospitalization due to "Risk of danger to self; Risk of danger to others; Unable to care for self; and Risk of decompensation in a less structured setting." In addition, VA treatment records dated January 20, 2021 remarked that the Veteran was hospitalized on January 14, 2021 "at the urging of his peer support specialist after patient was endorsing SI and attempting to overdose on crack cocaine." VA treatment records dated February 3, 2021 note that the Veteran was admitted to the hospital due to PTSD/mental health. 

Thus, the Board finds that the favorable finding that the Veteran was hospitalized on January 4, 2021, was a clear and unmistakable error. The evidence clearly demonstrated that the Veteran was first admitted to the hospital for his service-connected PTSD on January 14, 2021 and that he was discharged on February 1, 2021.

VA treatment records later in February 2021 document that the Veteran was preparing to go to a 42-day residential inpatient treatment program for his service-connected PTSD at Warriors Heart in Texas, and his arrival at the program was confirmed on February 19, 2021. 

The evidence reflects that the Veteran was hospitalized for over 21 days during the appeal period for treatment of a service-connected disability which resulted in surgery necessitating at least one month of convalescence. The February 2021 VA treatment records note more than 21 days of hospitalization following treatment for service-connected PTSD. Specifically, the Veteran attended a 42-day residential inpatient treatment program at Warriors Heart in Texas.

Therefore, entitlement to a temporary evaluation of 100 percent based on hospitalization over 21 days and surgical or other treatment necessitating convalescence is warranted.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for PTSD

The Veteran contended that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than August 21, 2017, for the grant of a 50 percent rating and an effective date earlier than April 8, 2021 for the grant of a 100 percent rating for PTSD. 

Generally, an award of service connection will be effective on the day following separation from active military service or the date on which entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service. Otherwise, except as specifically provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award for pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

The Court has interpreted the laws and regulations pertaining to the effective date for an increase as follows: if the increase occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the award is effective the date of claim. If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1), (2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (stating that section 5110(b)(2), now section 5110(b)(3), requires that "an increase in a veteran's service-connected disability must have occurred during the one year prior to the date of the Veteran's claim...to receive the benefit of an earlier effective date"). 

By way of background, in a December 2015 rating decision, the RO denied entitlement to a rating greater than 30 percent for PTSD. In a January 2016 correspondence, the Veteran stated that his case was opened in August 2015 (when he submitted his increased rating claim) and it was closed in December 2015. He was notified that the decision was not put into the system, and he was informed that he had to write a letter to receive a decision in the mail. He requested a copy of the December 2015 decision. The Veteran's claims file does contain a notification letter informing the Veteran of the December 2015 denial, nor is there evidence that a copy of the December 2015 decision was ever sent to the Veteran. Therefore, the Board finds that the December 2015 rating decision remained pending, and it may therefore consider evidence received within one year of his August 19, 2015 increased rating claim.

In a September 2017 rating decision, the RO granted a 50 percent rating for PTSD, effective August 21, 2017, the date it received his claim. In 2018, the Veteran was assigned a temporary total rating for his hospitalization for PTSD that exceeded 21 days. In September 2018, a 50 percent rating was assigned

In a September 2021 rating decision, the RO granted a 100 percent rating for PTSD, effective June 16, 2021, the date it received his claim. In a June 2022 rating decision, the RO granted a new effective date of April 8, 2021 for his 100 percent rating, the date of Dr. H. provided a private opinion that the Veteran's PTSD caused total occupational and social impairment. 

Turning to the pertinent evidence, in April 2023, Dr. H. provided an addendum opinion. She stated the Veteran's PTSD has caused total social and occupational impairment since at least July 2015. As rationale, she indicated had reviewed the pertinent medical and lay evidence, to include the Veteran's descriptions of severe PTSD symptoms, including interference with his familial relationships, as well as with his co-workers and supervisors. Dr. H. noted that August 2014 VA treatment records document that the Veteran suffered from suicidal ideation, and his PTSD symptoms were progressively worsening. In addition, a November 2015 VA PTSD examination report stated that the Veteran was divorced, had worked eight jobs and was fired from six jobs due to verbal altercations and insubordination. She also noted that medical literature reflects that PTSD can cause trust, closeness, and communication skills to break down. In addition, people with PTSD are more likely to feel irritable, intensely anger, and irritable. Dr. H. concluded that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms caused total social and occupational impairment, as evidenced by his inability to maintain employment, his divorce, and strained relationships with his friends.  

Upon review, the Board finds that since August 19, 2015 (the date VA received his increased rating claim for PTSD), the Veteran's PTSD symptoms have resulted in total occupational and social impairment. Specifically, the August 2014 VA treatment records, November 2015 VA PTSD examination report, and April 2023 private medical opinion from Dr. H. reflect that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms such as suicidal ideation, intense anger, lack of trust, and increased irritability resulted in the breakdown of his marriage, his strained relationship with his friends, and numerous workplace altercations/insubordination that resulted in six terminations. Moreover, the evidence documents that the Veteran had to be hospitalized due to a suicide attempt in January 2021. Thus, taken together, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence supports finding an effective date of August 19, 2015, but no earlier, is warranted for the award of an increased, 100 percent rating for PTSD.

In reaching the above conclusions, the Board is mindful that the symptoms listed in the rating schedule are essentially examples of the type and degree of symptoms indicative of the level of impairment required for each such rating, and that the Veteran need not demonstrate those exact symptoms to warrant a higher disability rating. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002). 

As explained above, the Board has found that that the evidence of record shows that since August 19, 2015, the Veteran has manifested sufficient symptoms of the type and extent, frequency, or severity (as appropriate) to result in total occupational and social impairment required for the increased disability rating of 100 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

Thus, the persuasive evidence reflects that an effective date of August 19, 2015, but no earlier, for the award of a 100 percent rating for PTSD is warranted. As the persuasive evidence is against an effective date earlier than August 19, 2015, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application.

3. Earlier effective date for DEA

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the award of DEA under Chapter 35. Basic eligibility for DEA benefits is established under 38 U.S.C. § 3500 et seq., if the following conditions are met: (1) The veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent and total service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021.

As noted above, the Board granted the Veteran a 100 percent rating for PTSD, effective August 19, 2015. DEA benefits may likewise be awarded effective the date of an award for a permanent and total disability rating. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510. Consequently, the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of August 19, 2015, for DEA benefits.
