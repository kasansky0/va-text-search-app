FINDING OF FACT

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) did not issue a rating decision addressing the CUE matters first raised in the February 18, 2024, VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the Veteran's CUE motion for revision or reversal of a September 2013 rating decision that denied service connection for OSA have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5109A, 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the Veteran's CUE motion for revision or reversal of a September 2013 rating decision that assigned an initial 30 percent rating for PTSD with a TBI have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5109A, 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

4. The criteria for dismissal of the Veteran's CUE motion for revision or reversal of a July 2023 rating decision that granted an initial 30 percent rating for migraine headaches have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5109A, 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2006 to April 2009.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) pursuant to the February 2023 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, wherein the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket; however, in March 2024, he switched to the Evidence docket.  

1. Entitlement to revision or reversal of a September 2013 rating decision that denied service connection for OSA.

2. Entitlement to revision or reversal of a September 2013 rating decision that assigned an initial 30 percent rating for PTSD with a TBI.

3. Entitlement to revision or reversal of a September 2013 rating decision that failed to adjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches.

4. Entitlement to revision or reversal of a July 2023 rating decision that granted an initial 30 percent rating for migraine headaches.

In a February 18, 2024, Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran identified the rating decisions he was appeal as August 2023 and February 2024; however, the specific issues he was appealing involved CUE in the September 2013 rating decision that denied his initial October 2011 claims.  This is consistent with a statement he submitted several day later that detailed the alleged errors.  See February 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD and February 2024 Correspondence.  

The Veteran first raised CUE in the February 18, 2024, Notice of Disagreement, so the AOJ has not had an opportunity to adjudicate errors raised in the motion.  In a statement submitted a few days after submission of the February 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran clearly asserted that his appealed issues sought earlier effective dates for these awards based on revision of the September 2013 rating decision due to CUE in the same, and by no other means, such as application of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 and/or the concept of continuous pursuit.  

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that each theory of CUE is a separate "claim" that the RO must adjudicate in the first instance.  Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002); see also Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006) (explaining that 38 U.S.C. § 5109A requires that a request for revision of a final RO decision based on CUE be submitted to the RO for initial adjudication).  Therefore, the Board cannot adjudicate the motion in the first instance. 

The Board also notes that remand is not an available option because there is no pre-decisional error or error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Since the RO did not adjudicate CUE, there is no case or controversy currently in front of the Board.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c). Consequently, the case must be dismissed without prejudice.

This decision does not preclude the Veteran from filing another CUE motion with the AOJ or requesting that February 2024 CUE motion be acted upon by the AOJ.
