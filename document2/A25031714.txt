REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for a brain tumor is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1984 to March 1986, from February 1991 to May 1991, and from January 2002 to August 2003. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), also known as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In a November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran appealed the October 2023 rating decision to the Board and selected direct review. Accordingly, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for a brain tumor

The Veteran seeks an effective date of June 2014 for the grant of service connection for a brain tumor because he previously filed a claim for service connection for a brain tumor in June 2014. 

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or a supplemental claim will      be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is    later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If a supplemental claim is received more than one year after the date the AOJ issued notice of a prior decision, the effective date will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2). If a claim is reviewed at the request of a claimant within one year of the effective date of a liberalizing law, and a benefit is awarded pursuant to that liberalizing law, benefits may be authorized from the effective date of the liberalizing law. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(p), 3.114(a). 

Additionally, if VA receives relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided a claim, VA will reconsider the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). Such records include, but are not limited to, service records that are related to a claimed in-service event, injury, or disease, regardless of whether such records mention the veteran by name, and declassified records that could not have been obtained because the records were classified when VA decided the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1)(i), (iii). If such relevant official service department records are received, VA is required to reconsider the claim even if they are received after service connection has already been granted. See Emerson v. Mcdonald, 28 Vet. App. 200, 210 (2016). However, "the question of an earlier effective date under (c)(3) arises only if VA determines that an award is warranted based all or in part on the newly associated official service department records." Id. 

On June 23, 2014, the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for brain cancer due to exposures in Afghanistan. That claim was denied in a September 2014 rating decision. 

On August 10, 2022, the President signed into law the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), which provided presumptive service connection for certain diseases, including brain cancer, for covered veterans based on exposure to burn pits and other toxins in, among other places, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1119(c)(1)(B), 1120. 

On August 8, 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for service connection for brain cancer. He also submitted a document titled "Final Environmental Site Characterization and Operational Health Risk Assessment, Stronghold Freedom, Karshi Khanabad Airfield, Uzbekistan 27 October - 27 November 2001." That document, which was declassified in February 2020, summarized the findings of the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventative Medicine - Europe (CHPPM-EUR), which conducted an environmental site characterization at Stronghold Freedom between October 2001 and November 2001 to evaluate contaminants and potential exposure pathways that could impact the health of U.S. military personnel assigned at Stronghold Freedom. The document identified a number of environmental contaminants and potential adverse health effects. 

In an October 2023 rating decision, service connection for a brain tumor was granted on a presumptive basis under the PACT Act. As the Veteran's supplemental claim was received more than one year after the prior denial, but within one year of the PACT Act's effective date, an effective date of August 10, 2022, was assigned. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.114(a). However, the October 2023 rating decision did not address the Final Environmental Site Characterization and Operational Health Risk Assessment, and the AOJ did not appear to consider it when assigning the effective date. Personnel records show that the Veteran served at Stronghold Freedom, Karshi Khanabad Airfield, during his period of active duty from January 2002 to August 2003. As the Final Environmental Site Characterization and Operational Health Risk Assessment relates to an in-service event or injury and was not declassified until February 2020, it constitutes a relevant official service department record that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). Therefore, VA is required to reconsider the claim. See id.; see also Emerson, 28 Vet. App. at 210. However, an earlier effective date is only warranted if VA determines that service connection is warranted based all or in part on that document. In order to resolve that question, VA should have obtained a medical opinion as to whether service connection is warranted on a direct basis based all or in part on the newly associated official service department record. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); see also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2006). Accordingly, the claim is remanded to correct this duty-to-assist error. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  

Additionally, the claim is remanded for the AOJ to satisfy the regulatory duty to consider whether an earlier effective date is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) based on the receipt of the relevant official service department record and to preserve the Veteran's right to one review on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (the Board may remand for correction of an error of the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility in aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim). 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a medical opinion with respect to the claim for an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for a brain tumor. Upon review of the record, the examiner should provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is in approximate balance, if not higher) that the Veteran's glioblastoma multiform was caused by in-service exposure to environmental contaminants while serving at Stronghold Freedom, Karshi Khanabad Airfield, Uzbekistan during his period of service from January 2002 to August 2003, including the contaminants identified in the document titled "Final Environmental Site Characterization and Operational Health Risk Assessment, Stronghold Freedom, Karshi Khanabad Airfield, Uzbekistan 27 October - 27 November 2001" (VBMS - Correspondence, received 8/8/23).

The examiner may not rely solely on the fact that brain cancer is now presumptively related to exposure to burn pits and other toxins in Uzbekistan. The examiner is advised that service connection has already been granted for a brain tumor based that presumption. However, an earlier effective date may be warranted if it is determined that the Veteran's brain tumor is directly related to service based all or in part on the document titled "Final Environmental Site Characterization and Operational Health Risk Assessment, Stronghold Freedom, Karshi Khanabad Airfield, Uzbekistan 27 October - 27 November 2001."

The examiner should provide a detailed rationale and complete medical explanation for all opinions. If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why.

2. Adjudicate the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for a brain tumor under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) based on the receipt of the relevant official service department record titled "Final Environmental Site Characterization and Operational Health Risk Assessment, Stronghold Freedom, Karshi Khanabad Airfield, Uzbekistan 27 October - 27 November 2001" (VBMS - Correspondence, received 8/8/23).
