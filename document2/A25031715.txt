ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of July 24, 2023 for the grant of service connection for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome (right knee disability), is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for right leg shin splints is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for kidney abnormalities is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a dental condition is denied.

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left knee strain is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has a right knee disability that VA has found to be related to her active service.

2. The reviewable evidence is not sufficient to establish that the Veteran has right leg shin splints.

3. The available evidence is not sufficient to establish that the Veteran has a kidney disability.

4. The available evidence is not sufficient to establish that the Veteran has a current dental disability.

5. There is no evidence of dental injury or disease during service, apart from removal of wisdom teeth.

6. During the period on appeal, the evidence shows that the Veteran's left knee strain resulted in, at worst, painful motion without limitation of motion.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a right knee disability have been met since July 24, 2023. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310, 3.400. 

2. The criteria for service connection for right leg shin splints are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for a kidney disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for service connection for a dental disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.381, 4.150.

5. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee strain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5256-5261.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from March 2016 to March 2020.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In May 2024, the Veteran timely filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) appealing the decision to the Board and requesting Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301-20.303.

Under Direct Review, the record on appeal is limited to the record that was before VA on the date the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (in this case, the RO) issued the decision on appeal. In general, evidence may not be added to the record after that date; furthermore, a Direct Review appellant is not entitled to a hearing before the Board. See 38 U.S.C. § 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. In this case, the record on appeal has been closed from October 3, 2023.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability on either a direct or secondary basis. Entitlement to service connection on a direct basis requires (1) evidence of current nonservice-connected disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current nonservice-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Establishing secondary service connection requires competent medical or lay evidence of: (1) a current disability that is not already service connected; (2) at least one service-connected disability; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the service-connected disability, showing that the current disability was either proximately due to or the result of the service-connected disability or that the current disability was aggravated beyond its natural progression by the service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability

In April 2024, during the pendency of this appeal, the Veteran filed another claim seeking service connection for right leg shin splints. In August 2024, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2009) (claims shall be broadly construed to encompass related disabilities).

In its August 2024 decision, the RO found that the Veteran's right knee disability had "been established as directly related to military service." The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The assignment of effective dates is governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If a claim is received within one year of a veteran's separation from service, the effective date will be the date of separation from active duty or the date that entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). Otherwise, the effective date for an award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date that entitlement arose, whichever is later. Id.

The RO granted an effective date of April 19, 2024-the date the Veteran's most recent claim for right leg shin splints was received-for the grant of service connection for a right knee disability. However, the Veteran already had a pending claim for right leg shin splints-the claim currently on appeal-that had been received on July 24, 2023.

Therefore, the Board finds that the effective date of service connection for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome should be July 24, 2023.

Entitlement to service connection for right leg shin splints

To the extent that the Veteran seeks service connection for right leg shin splints as a separate disability from her service-connected right knee disability, the claim must be denied.

There is no lay or medical evidence of a current diagnosis of shin splints prior to October 3, 2023. (The Board is barred from reviewing a May 2024 VA examination related to the Veteran's leg disabilities.) Therefore, the first element of service connection is not met. 

The Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination of her legs as part of this appeal, which may or may not have revealed evidence of right leg shin splints had it taken place. However, the Veteran was a no-show for this examination, leaving the RO to decide her service connection claim based on the existing record. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

The Veteran said in her May 2024 NOD that she missed the examination due to not being permitted time off work. While the Board acknowledges that this may be good cause for her non-attendance, she did not provide this evidence of good cause until after the October 2023 rating decision. Therefore, the RO did not err in denying her claim at the time. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (appeals under the modernized review system can only be remanded to correct errors by the agency of original jurisdiction). 

As the available evidence does not support the Veteran's claim of service connection for right leg shin splints, and there is no basis for a remand, entitlement to service connection for right leg shin splints must be denied.

Entitlement to service connection for kidney abnormalities

While the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) document complaints of dysuria in January 2020, there is no evidence of chronic kidney problems after service. Therefore, the first element of service connection-evidence of a current non-service-connected disability-is not met.

The Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination related to her claimed kidney condition, which may or may not have revealed evidence of a kidney disability had it taken place. However, the Veteran was a no-show for this examination, leaving the RO to decide her service connection claim based on the existing record. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

The Veteran said in her May 2024 NOD that she missed the examination due to not being permitted time off work. While the Board acknowledges that this may be good cause for her non-attendance, she did not provide this evidence of good cause until after the October 2023 rating decision. Therefore, the RO did not err in denying her claim at the time. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (appeals under the modernized review system can only be remanded to correct errors by the agency of original jurisdiction). 

As the available evidence does not support the Veteran's claim of service connection for kidney abnormalities, and there is no basis for a remand, entitlement to service connection for a kidney disability must be denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a dental disability

Dental disabilities which may be awarded compensable disability ratings are set forth under 38 C.F.R. § 4.150. These disabilities include chronic osteomyelitis or osteoradionecrosis of the maxilla or mandible, loss of the mandible, nonunion or malunion of the mandible, limited temporomandibular motion, loss of the ramus, loss of the condyloid or coronoid processes, loss of the hard palate, loss of teeth due to the loss of substance of the body of the maxilla or mandible and where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis, when the bone loss is a result of trauma or disease but not the result of periodontal disease. 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Codes 9900-9916.

Treatable carious teeth, replaceable missing teeth, dental or alveolar abscesses, and periodontal disease are not compensable disabilities, but may nevertheless be service connected solely for the purpose of establishing eligibility for outpatient dental treatment. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.381; see also Mays v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 302, 306 (1993) (holding that a claim for service connection for a dental condition may also be considered a claim for VA outpatient dental treatment). Under 38 U.S.C. § 1712(a)(1)(C) and 38 C.F.R. § 17.161(c), the term "service trauma" does not include the intended effects of treatment provided during the Veteran's military service. Nielson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d 802, 804-05 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

There is no evidence of the Veteran ever having a dental injury or disease for which a compensable disability rating could be awarded. Furthermore, there is no evidence of treatable carious teeth, replaceable missing teeth, dental or alveolar abscesses, or periodontal disease, either during or after service.

The Veteran's STRs do document wisdom tooth extraction in April 2017. However, 38 C.F.R. 3.381(f)(3) specifically prohibits service connection for treatment purposes of "third molars" (wisdom teeth) "unless disease or pathology of the tooth developed after 180 days or more of active service, or was due to combat or in-service trauma." While the Veteran's wisdom tooth extraction took place more than 180 days into her active service, there is no indication that it was due to recent pathology rather than a routine removal.

As the record does not establish evidence of a dental disability for which service connection may be granted, for either compensation or treatment purposes, entitlement to service connection for a dental disability is denied. 

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing the manifestations of a disability with the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic Codes (DCs) of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § Part 4. The percentage ratings represent, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity (in civilian occupations) resulting from service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses is to be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. However, separate ratings may be assigned to different conditions if they do not constitute the same disability or manifestation thereof. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261 (1994).

When there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt shall be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

A schedular rating may be increased if there is objective evidence during examination or treatment of functional loss exceeding that fixed by a schedular rating. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206 (1995); Mitchell v Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  

Separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found, a practice known as "staged" ratings. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999). The effective date for a staged rating is when it is factually ascertainable that a particular rating is warranted. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509 (2007).

Evaluation of left knee strain

The Veteran's left knee strain is currently rated under DC 5260, for limitation of flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. However, her 10 percent rating was assigned based on painful motion. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 (a veteran with a painful, unstable, or malaligned joint, due to healed injury, is entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint even if she does not otherwise meet the criteria for a minimum compensable rating under the applicable DC). The only reviewable VA examination of her knees, in October 2020, found no limitation of motion, but did note pain on both flexion and extension. The October 2020 examiner found no evidence of instability, loss of muscle strength, or meniscal pathology, and found that the Veteran's left knee symptoms did not worsen during flare-ups or after repeated use over time.

As there are no apparent deficiencies with the October 2020 VA examination, and none have been alleged by the Veteran, the Board assigns probative weight to the examination report. There is no other reviewable evidence demonstrating limitation of motion, instability, or meniscal pathology, that could support an increased rating for left knee strain. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DCs 5256-5261.

The Veteran was scheduled for a new VA examination in August 2023 to evaluate her left knee strain. However, the Veteran was a no-show for this examination, leaving the RO to decide her increased rating claim based on the existing, unfavorable record. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

The Veteran said in her May 2024 NOD that she missed the examination due to not being permitted time off work. While the Board acknowledges that this may be good cause for non-attendance, the Veteran did not provide this evidence of good cause until after the October 2023 rating decision. Therefore, the RO did not err in denying her claim at the time. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (appeals under the modernized review system can only be remanded to correct errors by the agency of original jurisdiction). 

As the available evidence does not support an increased rating for left knee strain, and there is no basis for a remand, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee strain must be denied.
