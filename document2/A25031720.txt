DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 30 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea condition is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for lower gastrointestinal disorder, also claimed as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The persuasive evidence shows that the Veteran's symptoms of his service-connected PTSD resulted in occupational and social impairment with occasional decreases in work efficiencies and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks. Symptoms of occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity have not been demonstrated.

2. The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was not shown as chronic in-service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; continuity of symptomatology is not established; and the disability is not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease, including toxic exposure risk activities (TERA).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a rating more than 30 percent for PTSD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.132, Diagnostic Code 9411. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1987 to June 1991.

The Veteran filed his claims of service connection in June 2019. The claims were denied in a November 2019 rating decision.  The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement, request for supplemental claim or request for higher level review within one year. Therefore, the decision is final. See 38 U.S.C. § 501; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, supplemental claim, in December 2023, requesting review of the service connection claims denied in the November 2019 rating decision. 

In an April 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for PTSD and assigned a 30 percent rating, and denied the claims of service connection for GERD, IBS, bilateral hearing loss, and sleep apnea. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

To the extent the Veteran has presented argument outside of an evidentiary window, the AMA does not prevent the Board from considering argument that was submitted outside of the evidentiary window, thus the Board has considered that argument. See, i.e., August 16, 2024, Written Brief Presentation. However, the Board has not considered any additional evidence that was submitted outside of the permissible evidentiary windows. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300 (a).

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased rating claim

1. Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 30 percent for PTSD (also claimed as mental health)

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a Veteran's present symptomatology with criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on average impairment in earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When a question arises as to which of two ratings apply under a particular diagnostic code, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability evaluations. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).

Evidence to be considered in the appeal of the assignment of a disability rating is not limited to that reflecting the then current severity of the disorder. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). In cases where an initially assigned disability evaluation has been disagreed with, it is possible for a veteran to be awarded separate percentage evaluations for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period (i.e., "staged ratings"). Fenderson at 126-28.

The Veteran's PTSD has been assigned an evaluation of 30 percent throughout the appeal period pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411. The rating criteria pertaining to the Veteran's appeal is subsumed into the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (General Rating Formula).

Under the General Rating Formula, a 30 percent evaluation contemplates occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, or mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, and recent events). Id.

A 50 percent evaluation is warranted where the disorder is manifested by occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory for example, retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. Id.

A 70 percent evaluation is warranted where the disorder is manifested by occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech that is intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence; spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting; and an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id.

A 100 percent disability evaluation is warranted when there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time and place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Id.

With regard to the use of the phrases such as in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 (General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders), ratings are assigned according to the manifestations of particular symptoms. However, the use of the phrase such as in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve only as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002). Accordingly, the evidence considered in determining the level of impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 is not restricted to the symptoms provided in the Diagnostic Code. Instead, VA must consider all symptoms of a claimant's condition that affect the level of occupational and social impairment.

As noted above, the Veteran's PTSD has been assigned an evaluation of 30 percent throughout the appeal period. After reviewing the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board concludes that the evidence of record weighs against the assignment of an evaluation greater than 30 percent at any point during the appeal period.

Turning to the record, in a December 2023 VA treatment record, the Veteran was cooperative throughout the appointment, dressed appropriately for weather, and presented with fair hygiene. Veterans stated mood was "okay" and affect was congruent. Thought process, content and speech within normal limits. The Veteran was oriented to person, time and date, presented with fair judgment, insight, and memory. Veteran did not express any auditory or visual hallucinations, or any suicidal or homicidal ideations.

The Veteran underwent a VA PTSD examination in January 2024. The examiner diagnosed PTSD. The Veteran's symptoms included depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances. A mental status examination was normal. Regarding social impairment, the Veteran was married with two sons. He reported trouble being around others and mostly stayed home. Regarding occupational impairment, the Veteran was noted to have conflicts with some customers that affected his work and physical pain that led to his unemployment. The examiner opined that his PTSD manifested as occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence does not support the assignment of an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for PTSD. The Veteran did not report difficulty in occupational or social functioning sufficient to approximate a higher evaluation, and at no time does the objective evidence of record find the Veteran suffered from impaired abstract thinking, speech, judgment, insight or ability to understand complex commands. The Veteran was noted be appropriately dressed and adequately groomed. Therefore, the Board finds the Veteran's symptomatology most closely approximates that contemplated by a 30 percent evaluation throughout the appeal. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Veteran is competent to attest to things he experiences through his senses, such as anxiety, anger, intrusive thoughts, hypervigilance, and depressed mood. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The statements from the Veteran are competent evidence to report his increased psychiatric symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469, 470 (1994). The Veteran is also credible in his belief that he is entitled to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent. However, the more persuasive evidence does not support the assignment of a higher evaluation. In so finding, the Board notes that it weighed the lay and medical evidence and finds more probative opinions rendered by the VA examiner given her expertise in evaluating psychiatric disorders.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's appeal for a rating in excess of 30 percent for PTSD. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Service connection claims

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three elements: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after separation when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation. 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1372; see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (addressing lay evidence as potentially competent to support presence of disability even where not corroborated by contemporaneous medical evidence). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis or etiology when (1) a lay person is competent to identify a medical condition; (2) the lay person is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

When there is an approximate balance of evidence shown, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is for application. See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss 

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Establishing service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, such as sensorineural hearing loss, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

Impaired hearing constitutes a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels. Higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993). The auditory thresholds set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 establish when hearing loss is severe enough to be considered a disability eligible for service connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Service treatment records show the audiograms in April 1987 and April 1990. His puretone thresholds in April 1987 were as follows:

	500 Hz	1000 Hz	2000 Hz	3000 Hz	4000 Hz

Right	5	5	10	10	20

Left	5	0	5	20	20

His puretone thresholds in April 1990 were as follows:

	500 Hz	1000 Hz	2000 Hz	3000 Hz	4000 Hz

Right	5	5	15	20	5

Left	5	0	0	20	30

In a September 1998 post-service audiogram, the Veteran's puretone thresholds were as follows:

	500 Hz	1000 Hz	2000 Hz	3000 Hz	4000 Hz

Right	5	5	5	5	15

Left	10	5	0	10	30

In a July 2018 audiogram, the Veteran's puretone thresholds were as follows:

	500 Hz	1000 Hz	2000 Hz	3000 Hz	4000 Hz

Right	5	5	5	5	15

Left	10	5	0	10	30

In an August 2019 audiogram, the Veteran's puretone thresholds were as follows:

	500 Hz	1000 Hz	2000 Hz	3000 Hz	4000 Hz

Right	10	10	5	25	25

Left	55	65	70	80	85

The Veteran underwent a VA hearing loss examination in October 2019. The Veteran reported being exposed to gunfire while working in an artillery unit during service. He also reported a sudden hearing loss in the left ear around summer 2019, although denied seeking medical treatment for this loss. Prior to the sudden change of hearing in the left ear in summer 2019, he reports that his ears were equal in hearing.  

An audiogram showed his puretone thresholds were as follows:

	500 Hz	1000 Hz	2000 Hz	3000 Hz	4000 Hz

Right	5	5	5	15	20

Left	65	70	65	75	80

His speech discrimination scores were 96 percent in the right ear and 12 percent in the left ear. 

The examiner found that the Veteran had normal hearing in his right ear and sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear.

Regarding his left ear, the VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not caused by or a result of noise exposure during service, because 

"The records showed no hearing loss or permanent significant changes in hearing thresholds greater than normal measurement variability during military service." 

A shift is noted in 2019 which is 28 years after leaving active duty military service. 

The Institute of Medicine (2006) stated there was insufficient scientific basis to conclude that permanent hearing loss directly attributable to noise exposure will develop long after noise exposure. The IOM panel concluded that based on their current understanding of auditory physiology a prolonged delay in the onset of noise-induced hearing loss was unlikely.  

Based on the objective evidence (audiograms), we may conclude there is no evidence on which to conclude that the Veteran's current hearing loss was caused by or a result of the veteran's military service, including noise exposure."

The Veteran underwent a VA hearing loss examination in January 2024. An audiogram showed his puretone thresholds were as follows:

	500 Hz	1000 Hz	2000 Hz	3000 Hz	4000 Hz

Right	15	20	20	40	30

Left	95	85	95	100	100

His speech discrimination scores were 96 percent in the right ear and 0 percent in the left ear. 

The examiner opined that VA does not recognize a connection between TERA and hearing loss. 

Further, the January 2024 examiner stated a left ear hearing loss existed prior to service. However, that hearing loss (30 at 4000 Hz) does not meet the definition of hearing loss for VA purposes under § 3.385. The Board assigns it no weight and relies only on the 2019 opinion, which considers the greater benefit of full service connection and not service aggravation (which is more advantageous to the Veteran). 

In the April 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the following favorable finding: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during your service. [The Veteran's] personnel records show [he] had a military occupation specialty of Light Wheel Vehicle Mechanic, therefore exposure to acoustic trauma is conceded." The Board is bound by this finding. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran currently has bilateral hearing loss, as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. In-service noise exposure is also presumed. However, there is no evidence that the Veteran was treated for any hearing impairment during, or for many years following service. In fact, there are no medical records documenting any complaints of hearing loss until the sudden left ear hearing loss in 2019, 28 years after his discharge from service. He has contended that the hearing loss is due to acoustic trauma in service but has not indicated that he first noticed hearing loss in service, and as noted, there are no immediate post-service complaints or findings.

When determining the adequacy and probative value of a medical opinion, the Board must consider whether the medical text evidence that the medical opinion relies on contains qualifying or contradictory aspects. McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243 (2019). If the Board finds that a medical text that serves as the basis for a medical opinion contains apparent qualifiers or contradictions, or if the veteran raises the issue or it is reasonably raised from review of the evidence of record, the Board must address that issue and explain whether those aspects of the medical text diminish the probative value of the medical opinion evidence or render the opinion inadequate, and if not, why not. Id. 

Regarding the IOM study, the McCray Court noted that, although the report concluded that "based on current knowledge of cochlear physiology there was no sufficient scientific basis for the existence of delayed-onset hearing loss," the report also stated that "[t]here is not sufficient evidence from longitudinal studies in laboratory animals or humans to determine whether permanent noise-induced hearing loss can develop much later in one's lifetime, long after the cessation of that noise exposure" and that "definitive studies to address this issue have not been performed." The Court determined that these statements appeared to be contradictory or qualifying and that it was incumbent on the Board to discuss such apparent contradictions or qualifiers when providing adequate reasons and bases. The Board acknowledges that the October 2019 VA examiner relied, in part, on the IOM report as a basis for providing a negative opinion and the IOM report has apparently qualifying or contradictory statements. The Board finds that this does not render the opinion inadequate or diminish its probative value to zero. The IOM report concluded that "based on current knowledge of cochlear physiology there was no sufficient scientific basis for the existence of delayed-onset hearing loss" while also stating that "definitive studies to address this issue have not been performed." However, based on the evidence available, the report stated that it was "unlikely" that delayed hearing loss effects occur. This statement tends to show that the limitation was considered, but the IOM was confident in the available data (anatomical and physiological) to make a conclusion utilizing a strongly worded term ("unlikely"). Indeed, the committee noted its understanding of the mechanisms and processes involved in the recovery from noise exposure as it suggested "a delay of many years in the onset of noise-induced hearing loss following an earlier noise exposure is extremely unlikely."

The Board notes opposing studies or other contradictory medical evidence have not been submitted in this appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (a) ("a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits...."); Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (stating that the claimant has the burden to "present and support a claim for benefits" and noting that the benefit of the doubt standard in section 5107(b) is not applicable based on pure speculation or remote possibility). 

The Court in McCray referenced "a medical text's qualifying or contradictory aspects" as one factor on a non-exhaustive list that is relevant to the Board's evaluation of the probative value and adequacy of a medical opinion. See McCray, 31 Vet. App. 243. Here, the October 2019 VA examiner partially relied on the findings of the 2006 IOM report and discussed other factors that were contributors to the Veteran's current hearing impairment, such as the Veteran's reported post-military exposure to hazardous noise and in-service audiologic tests. The examiner also discussed and relied on the above-mentioned subsequent medical studies of delayed onset of hearing loss. Thus, the VA examiner did not rely entirely on the 2006 IOM report in forming the conclusion but, instead, considered all relevant facts in this case.

In sum, the Board finds that the medical studies relied on by the VA medical examiners are probative and support the ultimate conclusions, despite the Veteran's contentions. Moreover, the VA examiners relied on accurate facts, considered the Veteran's military in-service noise exposure, and subsequent, sudden, left ear hearing loss. Specifically, the Board finds probative the VA examiner's reliance on in-service evidence of no significant threshold shifts during service, the Veteran's statements that his hearing was the same in both ears until the sudden left ear hearing loss in 2019, and a lack of evidence showing complaints or treatment for impaired hearing between separation from service until 2019. Finally, the VA opinion discussed at length above are supported by sufficient rationale. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008).

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms of hearing loss. The Board must assess these statements and weigh them along with the rest of the evidence. Although the Veteran alleges that his hearing loss is a result of service, he also acknowledges that his hearing was the same in both ears until his sudden hearing loss in 2019. He did not specifically allege that he experienced hearing loss since service.

There is otherwise no evidence indicating compensable hearing loss within one year of separation from service, nor is there evidence, aside from the Veteran's assertions and the fact that there are no medical records documenting complaints of hearing problems until long after service, of a continuity of symptomatology since service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable as the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim and is not in approximate balance. Therefore, entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss disability is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for GERD is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for IBS is remanded. 

3. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea condition is remanded.

Remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error and afford the Veteran adequate VA opinions. VA obtained VA opinions regarding direct service connection and service connection as a result of exposure to a TERA; however, no opinions were obtained regarding secondary service connection prior to the rating decision on appeal.

The record shows that the Veteran's sleep apnea and gastrointestinal symptoms are associated with obesity. Specifically, post service treatment records from July 2019 show a history of obesity, snoring, and fatigue. The clinician recommended a sleep study for sleep apnea. The Veteran underwent a sleep study in June 2022 and was diagnosed with sleep apnea. In a July 2019 VA treatment record, the Veteran reported difficulty managing healthy diet and regular exercise due to his depression. Furthermore, the January 2024 VA examiner identified obesity as a risk factor for GERD. Therefore, the record reasonably raises claim of secondary service connection for sleep apnea, GERD, and IBS as a result of his service-connected PTSD, with obesity as an intermediary step. 

Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a)-(b). Secondary causation exists when, but for the service-connected disability, the non-service-connected was caused by a service-connected disability either in a direct, etiological way or via multiple steps in a causal chain. Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023). Secondary aggravation exists when the non-service-connected disability not caused by a service-connected disability would be less severe were it not for a service-connected disability. Id. at 1364. For example, secondary aggravation may be established where the natural progression of the non-service-connected disability could have been arrested or improved but for the service-connected disability. Id. 

Although obesity is not a condition for which service connection may be granted, obesity may qualify as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and another current disability. See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017; see also Garner v. Tran, 33 Vet. App. 241 (2021); Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020). In a secondary service connection claim, a theory of obesity as an intermediate step is raised when there is some evidence in the record which draws an association or suggests a relationship between the veteran's obesity, or weight gain resulting in obesity, and a service-connected condition. Considerations that could give rise to a reasonably raised theory of secondary service connection with obesity as an intermediate step may include, but are not limited to, statements by treating physicians or medical examiners attributing weight gain or obesity to the service-connected disability. Garner, 33 Vet. App. at 248. The Board finds obesity as an intermediate step is reasonably raised in this case.

As such, the failure to request VA opinions to address secondary causation correctly was a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b). As the opinions of record are inadequate, remand of the claims is necessary for new VA examinations with opinions addressing possible secondary causation.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and likely etiology of the Veteran's claimed secondary condition of obstructive sleep apnea, GERD, and IBS. The Veteran's claims folder must be made available to the examiner. All diagnostic testing deemed to be necessary by the examiner should be accomplished.

2. The examiner is requested to provide opinions responsive to the following:

(a.) Whether but for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD with depression, he would not have a current disability of OSA, GERD, and/or IBS.

(b.) Whether the Veteran's OSA, GERD, and/or IBS would be less severe and result in less functional impairment but for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD with depression.

(c.) If the examiner opines that OSA, GERD, and/or IBS would result in less functional impairment but for service-connected PTSD with depression, the examiner must attempt to establish a baseline level of severity of the diagnosed disability prior to aggravation by the primary service-connected disabilities.

(d.) In so doing, the examiner must also consider whether obesity was an "intermediate step" between any service-connected disability, in causing or contributing to any degree to his OSA, GERD, and/or IBS i.e., did the Veteran's service-connected disabilities result in (1) mobility limitations or reduced physical activity as a result of a service-connected physical disability; (2) reduced physical activity or inability to follow a course of exercise or diet as a result of service-connected disability; or (3) side effects of medication where the medication is prescribed for a service-connected disability.

3. For all opinions, the examiner is to note that the absence of medical evidence as the sole basis for a negative opinion is unacceptable for purposes of VA adjudication. The examiner must discuss the Veteran's lay statements and lay reports to treatment providers and state why or why not such evidence establishes service connection. The Board urges the examiner to note that opinions rendered without discussing such lay evidence will be deemed inadequate for VA adjudication purposes.

4. Adjudicate the claims.
