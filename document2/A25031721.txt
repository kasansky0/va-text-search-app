ORDER

Service connection for a sinus condition, diagnosed as rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis, is granted.  

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's sinus condition had its onset in and is related to service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a sinus condition have been met.? 38 U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131, 1154(a), 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303.? 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had multiple periods of active service in the United States Air Force, to include from May 2009 to September 2009, October 2011 to May 2012, July 2015 to November 2015, December 2015 to June 2016, August 2016 to November 2016, December 2016 to April 2017, and May 2017 to September 2017.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

By way of procedural history, in a May 2023 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for sinusitis.  

In September 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim and provided additional evidence including the September 2023 medical opinion.  

In a February 2024 rating decision, the RO found that new and relevant evidence had been received but confirmed and continued the denial of service connection for sinusitis.  

In February 2024, the Veteran filed a request for Higher Level Review (HLR), and in a June 2024 rating decision, the RO denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis.  

In the June 2024 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket, and she indicated that she would not submit additional evidence.? Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of notice of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision.?? 

In light of the above, the record closed on the date of the notice of the February 2024 rating decision.? 38?U.S.C. §?5103A(e)(1).?? 

The Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of the Veteran's right to change Board dockets under Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).  Moreover, as the Board is granting the matter, the Veteran will not be prejudiced.  As such, the Board will proceed to adjudicate this matter. 

SERVICE CONNECTION?? 

Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.? See Shedden v. Principi,?381 F.3d 1163?(Fed. Cir. 2004).????? 

Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. ?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).????? 

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value. ?38?U.S.C. §?7104(a); Baldwin v. West,?13?Vet. App.?1?(1999); see?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).????? 

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. ?38?U.S.C. §?5107.? When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.????? 

To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must persuasively stand against a finding that the evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim.? Lynch v. McDonough,?21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).????? 

The Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence.? Buchanan v. Nicholson,?451 F.3d 1331?(Fed. Cir. 2006).? The evaluation of evidence generally involves a 3-step inquiry.? First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source.? The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief.? Barr v. Nicholson,?21?Vet. App.?303?(2007) (Observing that once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible).????? 

The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the proffered evidence in light of the entirety of the record.? The Board also notes that under certain circumstances, lay evidence may be sufficient to establish a nexus.? Davidson v. Shinseki,?581 F.3d 1313, 1316?(Fed. Cir. 2009); Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 469?(1994).? Lay evidence has been found to be competent with regard to a disease that has "unique and readily identifiable features" that are "capable of lay observation."? Barr v. Nicholson,?21?Vet. App.?303, 308-09?(2007); Petitti v. McDonald,?27?Vet. App.?415, 427-28?(2015) (where the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims found objective evidence of pain need not come from a medical professional; a lay person may provide the requisite confirmation).????? 

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.? A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of symptoms.? Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 470?(1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).? Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.? Davidson v. Shinseki,?581 F.3d 1313, 1316?(Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson,?492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77?(Fed. Cir. 2007).????? 

Service connection for sinus condition, diagnosed as rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis, is granted.  

The Veteran seeks service connection for her sinus conditions.  The Veteran's record advanced multiple theories as to why her sinus condition is related to service, to include direct service connection because she contends that her symptoms had its onset in service, and that her condition is related to the Veteran's indicated toxic exposure risk activities (TERA).  See February 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; see also September 2023 medical opinion.  

Here, as explained below, the Board finds that all three elements of direct service connection are established by the competent and credibly lay and medical evidence of records as to the Veteran's sinus condition.? 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).?? 

Here, there is a current diagnosis of rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis.  See March 2023, and November 2023 VA examinations; see also September 2023 medical opinion; November 2023, February 2024 and June 2024 rating decisions.  

As to the in-service disease or injury element, in the June 2024 rating decision, the RO made the favorable finding that the Veteran did participate in a TERA, which was confirmed in the TERA Memorandum confirming individual exposure to toxins while in service.  See also November 2023 and February 2024 rating decisions.   

In support, the Veteran urged that her symptoms started while serving in Guantanamo Bay and referenced exposure to air, dust, wind, and mold while serving on military bases, as well as exposure to jet fuels and fumes.  See February 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; see also September 2023 medical opinion.  

Although the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not appear to document sinus conditions or symptoms thereof, the Veteran has reported that she had sinus symptoms during service.  Further, the Veteran's statements are reported to her treatment providers for sinusitis in the September 2023 medical opinion.  See Fed. R. Evid. 803 (4) (noting that statements made to physicians for the purposes of diagnosis and treatment are exceptionally trustworthy and not excluded by the hearsay rule because the declarant has a strong motive to tell the truth in order to receive proper care); see also White v. Illinois,?502 U.S. 346, 356?(1992) ("[A] statement made in the course of procuring medical services, where the declarant knows that a false statement may cause misdiagnosis or mistreatment, carries special guarantees of credibility....").  Indeed, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that although "many principles espoused in the Federal Rules of Evidence have no place in veterans jurisprudence[,]... recourse to the Rules is appropriate where they will assist in the articulation of the Board's reasons." Rucker v. Brown,?10?Vet. App.?67, 73?(1997). 

For example, in the September 2023 medical opinion, the Veteran reported to her treatment providers that she had sinus symptoms during service, claiming an onset while deployed in Guantanamo.  The Veteran is competent to report the onset of his symptoms.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303 (2007) (lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Her statements regarding experiencing sinus symptoms in service are credible and there is no evidence to the contrary.  Accordingly, the in-service disease or injury element has been met. 

All that remains to be resolved is whether the medical evidence of record establishes a link between the Veteran's service and her sinus condition. 

The VA medical opinions obtained in connection with this claim, do not address whether the Veteran's sinus condition had its onset during her service.  Rather, the April 2023 and November 2023 VA examiners opined that the Veteran's sinus conditions were at least as likely as not caused by the Veteran TERA.  The April 2023 examiner's rationale was that the Veteran's treatment records did not support a correlation between the current allergic rhinosinusitis and claimed exposure to dust, PFAS and mold during service.  Whereas the November 2023 examiner's rationale was that the Veteran's conditions were not diagnosed until five years after service and noted the Veteran's history of asthma as a child.  

As indicated above, the Veteran reports that she had symptoms of sinus problems during service, and she has had continuous symptoms in the years since service.  Further, in the September 2023 medical opinion, Dr. J.N. opined that the Veteran's sinus symptoms are associated with her active duty service in Guantanamo and exposure to jet fuels and fumes.  The examiner opined that the Veteran suffers from chronic sinusitis that was precipitated by her deployment in Guantanamo, and she would experience recurrent sinus symptoms.  

Here, the Board finds the opinion of the Veteran's treating VA primary care provider carries significant probative value based on their subjective matter expertise coupled with their unique familiarity with the Veteran's medical history over the prolonged course of their care.  See D'Aries v. Peake,?22 Vet. App. 97, 108?(2008).  

For the above reasons, the evidence is, at worst, evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's sinus condition had its onset during service.? See Flynn v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?500, 503 (1994) (noting that "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"); see also 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a) (Service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces).? 

In light of the foregoing, and after resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for sinus condition, diagnosed as rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis is warranted.? See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).? 

Further, in light of the Board's favorable determination, based on the competent and credible medical evidence showing that the Veteran's sinus condition had its onset in service, the Board need not address the Veteran's other theories of service connection.
