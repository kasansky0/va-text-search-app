ORDER

The appeal concerning the Veteran's GI Bill education benefits is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 in which he identified the issue as "GI Bill" and disagreement "with amount and service time"; however, the record contains no appealable decision on the issue in the preceding year.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal concerning the Veteran's GI Bill education benefits have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Air Force Reserves with period of active duty from July 2010 to October 2010 and from December 2010 to April 2011.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from the filing of an April 2023 VA Form 10182.

In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The appeal concerning the Veteran's GI Bill education benefits.

By way of background, the Veteran initially applied for education benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill-Select Reserve (MGIB-SR or Chapter 1606) in August 2011.  In May 2015, the Veteran submitted an application for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (Post-9/11 GI Bill or Chapter 33).  The Veteran indicated he wanted to relinquish his Chapter 1606 education benefits and start Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.  See June 2015 email correspondence.  In June 2015, the AOJ determined the Veteran had qualifying active duty service making him eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits.  The record indicates the Veteran's Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits was established effective June 11, 2015.  A June 2015 Chapter 33 Master Record indicates the Veteran relinquished his Chapter 1606 education benefits and his original entitlement was for 36 months with a delimiting date of April 29, 2026.  

In March 2018, the Veteran submitted a Request for Change of Program or Place of Training and indicated he was receiving Chapter 33 education benefits.  On the April 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran noted appeal of "GI Bill" and disagreement "with amount and service time."  The Veteran also indicated disagreement with a March 10, 2023 decision.  However, the record does not contain any AOJ decision dated in March 2023.  The Veteran's education file demonstrates there are no other documents associated with his education claims after April 2018.  As such, there is no AOJ decision regarding the Veteran's GI Bill education benefits within one year preceding the Veteran's VA Form 10182.   Thus, the Board must dismiss the claim for lack of jurisdiction.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104(c), 20.202(a)("the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees.").
