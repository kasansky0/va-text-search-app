CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a dental disability for compensation purposes have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1712, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.381(b), 4.150. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2018 to September 2022. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from September 2023 and November 2023 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), also known as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In a November 6, 2023, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran appealed the September 2023 and November 2023 rating decisions to the Board and selected direct review. With respect to the claim for service connection for a dental disability and the claim for TDIU, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued that decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. With respect to the claims for service connection for acne and bilateral shin splints, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued that decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. However, because the Board is remanding some of the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claims being remanded. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a dental disability for compensation purposes

The Veteran seeks service connection for a cavity that he asserts worsened during service. In a May 2023 written statement, the Veteran indicated that he received a filling in his bottom right tooth prior to service. He stated that he underwent a root canal during service, and the crown now makes his teeth feel abnormal. 

Disability compensation is only provided for certain specified types of service-connected dental disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 4.150. For other types of dental disorders, a veteran may be entitled to service connection for the purpose of receiving outpatient dental treatment only. 38 U.S.C. § 1712; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.381, 17.161.

The dental and oral conditions for which service connection may be awarded for compensation purposes include: chronic osteomyelitis or osteoradionecrosis of the maxilla or mandible, loss of the mandible, nonunion or malunion of the mandible, limited motion of the temporomandibular articulation, loss of the ramus, loss of   the condyloid or coronoid processes, loss of the hard palate, loss of the maxilla, malunion or nonunion of the maxilla, and loss of teeth due to loss of substance of the body of the maxilla or mandible. 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Codes 9900-9916. Compensation is available for loss of teeth only if such is due to bone loss through trauma or disease, such as osteomyelitis, and not the loss of the alveolar process as a result of periodontal disease. 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Note to Diagnostic Code 9913. Treatable carious teeth, replaceable missing teeth, dental or alveolar abscesses, and periodontal disease are not compensable disabilities and may be considered service connected solely for the purpose of establishing eligibility for outpatient dental treatment. 38 U.S.C. § 1712; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.381, 4.150.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a dental disability for which service connection can be granted for compensation purposes.  

Service dental treatment records show that in June 2019, the Veteran sought treatment for a bottom right toothache at tooth #30. He reported having that tooth filled before, and the treatment provider observed a large existing amalgam restoration. The diagnosis was apical periodontitis due to caries. The Veteran underwent a non-surgical root canal at tooth #30 and a subsequent crown lengthening procedure. In July 2020, the Veteran was treated for a fractured provisional crown. In August 2020, the temporary crown fell off and was re-cemented. 

The Veteran has not asserted, and the record does not suggest, that he has or has ever had chronic osteomyelitis or osteoradionecrosis of the maxilla or mandible, loss of the mandible, nonunion or malunion of the mandible, limited motion of the temporomandibular articulation, loss of the ramus, loss of the condyloid or coronoid processes, loss of the hard palate, loss of the maxilla, malunion or nonunion of the maxilla, and loss of teeth due to loss of substance of the body of the maxilla or mandible. 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Codes 9900-9916. As noted above, the Veteran indicated that he is seeking service connection for a crown that feels abnormal, which he claims was caused by in-service treatment for a cavity. The record shows that the crown on tooth #30 was placed when the Veteran was treated for periodontitis due to dental caries. Periodontal disease and treatable carious teeth are not conditions for which service connection can be granted for compensation purposes. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.381, 4.150, Diagnostic Codes 9900-9916.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has not received a VA examination pursuant to his claim for service connection for a dental disability. However, the Veteran has not asserted, and the record does not suggest, that he has or has ever had a compensable dental condition. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); see also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2006); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Codes 9900-9916. Accordingly, the Board finds that a VA examination was not required. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a dental disability for which service connection can be granted for compensation purposes. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.381(b), 4.150. As the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against the claim, service connection for a dental disability for compensation purposes is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 17, 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for a dental disability for outpatient treatment purposes 

A claim for service connection for a compensable dental disorder is also considered to be a claim for VA outpatient dental treatment. See Mays v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 302, 306 (1993). To date, it does not appear that such a claim has been adjudicated by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.381(a) (The VHA will adjudicate a claim for service connection for a dental condition for treatment purposes after the VHA determines a veteran meets the basic eligibility requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 17.161). Therefore, the issue of entitlement to service connection for a dental disability for outpatient treatment purposes is remanded to the AOJ for adjudication in the first instance to preserve the Veteran's right to one review on appeal. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103A, 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802; see also Sprinkle v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1180, 118384 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (noting that claims in VA benefits cases are initially developed and adjudicated by the AOJ and reviewed on appeal by the Board to ensure that claimants receive the benefit of this two-tiered review within the agency).

2. Entitlement to service connection for acne 

The Veteran underwent a VA skin examination in September 2023, during which he was diagnosed with acne affecting the nose and right submandibular area. The examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's acne was caused by his in-service exposure to fumes, fuel, oil, and transmission and radiator fluids. The examiner explained that risk factors for acne include, among other things, stress. As service connection is in effect for generalized anxiety disorder, the Bord finds that the AOJ should have obtained a medical opinion as to whether the Veteran's acne was caused or aggravated by his service-connected generalized anxiety disorder. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2006); see also Robinson v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008) (VA has an obligation to develop and consider all theories of entitlement that are reasonably raised by the record or the veteran). Accordingly, the claim is remanded to correct this duty-to-assist error. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  

3. Entitlement to service connection for left leg shin splints

4. Entitlement to service connection for right leg shin splints

The Veteran asserts that his bilateral shin splints were caused by running on uneven grounds while serving in Australia. During a December 2022 VA examination of the Veteran's left ankle, he reported a history of left shin splints, which had resolved. In October 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination pursuant to his claim for service connection for bilateral shin splints, during which he reported having sharp pain while running in Australia in 2021. He reported current symptoms of minor shin pains from time to time. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral shin splints and opined that they were less likely than not incurred in or caused by service because there was no documentation of shin splints in service, and the Veteran denied shin having shin splints during the December 2022 VA examination. The Board finds that the AOJ should have obtained a new medical opinion that addresses the Veteran's contention that his current shin splints were caused by the impact of wear and tear during service, including running on uneven grounds while serving in Australia. Additionally, as the December 2022 VA left ankle examination report noted a history of left shin splints, the Board finds that a medical opinion also should have been obtained as to whether the Veteran's left shin splints were caused or aggravated by his service-connected left lateral collateral ligament sprain. Accordingly, the claims are remanded to correct these duty-to-assist errors. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  

5. Entitlement to TDIU

The October 2023 VA examination report indicates that the Veteran's bilateral shin splints impacted his ability to work, as he reported difficulty standing for more than 45 minutes due to pain. Thus, the claim for service connection for bilateral shin splints could affect the Veteran's entitlement to TDIU. Accordingly, the claim for TDIU is remanded for contemporaneous adjudication. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Facilitate adjudication of entitlement to service connection for a dental disability for outpatient treatment purposes. 

2. Obtain another medical opinion pursuant to the Veteran's claim for service connection for acne. After review of the record, the examiner should provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is in approximate balance, if not higher) that the Veteran's acne would not have developed but for or was worsened or prevented from improving by the Veteran's service-connected generalized anxiety disorder. 

The examiner should provide a detailed rationale and complete medical explanation for all opinions. If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why.

3. Obtain another medical opinion pursuant to the Veteran's claim for service connection for bilateral shin splints. After review of the record, the examiner should answer the following:

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is in approximate balance, if not higher) that the Veteran's current left and/or right leg shin splints were incurred in or caused by service, to include as due to overuse and/or wear and tear from running on uneven grounds while serving in Australia? 

(b.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is in approximate balance, if not higher) that the Veteran's left leg shin splints would not have developed but for, or were worsened or prevented from improving by the Veteran's service-connected left lateral collateral ligament sprain? 

The examiner should provide a detailed rationale and complete medical explanation for all opinions. If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why.
