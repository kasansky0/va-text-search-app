ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have a current sleep apnea disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for sleep apnea have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2013 to March 2013.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2023 rating decision.  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2023 decision.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that on the August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran also expressed disagreement with the denials of service connection for chest pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, dizziness, irritable bowel syndrome, left knee strain with patellofemoral pain syndrome, memory problems, menstrual disorders, respiratory disorder, voice loss, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  The record reflects that in July 2024, the Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review request as to the issues of service connection for chest pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, dizziness, irritable bowel syndrome, left knee strain with patellofemoral pain syndrome, memory problems, menstrual disorders, respiratory disorder, and voice loss, and in August 2024, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim as to the issue of service connection for PTSD.  These claims were pending with the AOJ at the time the Veteran filed the August 2024 VA Form 10182.  Claimants may elect to review a decision of the VA Regional Office by filing a Supplemental Claim, Higher Level Review Request, or Board appeal, and simultaneous administrative review options of the same claim or issue, are not permitted under the AMA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500; see also Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 14 (2023).  As the July 2024 Higher-Level Review request and August 2024 Supplemental Claim were pending at the time the Veteran filed the August 2024 VA Form 10182, the August 2024 VA Form 10182 represents impermissible concurrent election in violation of 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b) for these issues.  The August 2024 VA Form 10182 therefore does not constitute a valid appeal for these issues, and an appeal as to these issues was not docketed by the Board.

The Veteran also expressed disagreement with the denials of service connection for a heart disability, bipolar disorder, hypertension, low back sprain/strain, migraine headaches, pes planus, and plantar fasciitis on the August 2024 VA Form 10182.  However, the record reflects that the claim for service connection for a heart disability was denied in a July 2023 rating decision and the claims for service connection for bipolar disorder, hypertension, low back sprain/strain, migraine headaches, pes planus, and plantar fasciitis were denied in an April 2023 rating decision.  A claimant must file a notice of disagreement within one year from the date that VA mails the notice of the decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).  A request for an extension of the period for filing a notice of disagreement may be granted for good cause and must be in writing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c).  Here, the Veteran did not file the VA Form 10182 as to these issues until August 2024, over one year after the issuance and notification of the April 2023 and July 2023 rating decisions.  The Veteran did not submit any motion for an extension to file a VA Form 10182, nor was any good cause given at the time of filing the VA Form 10182 to explain the untimeliness of the filing.  Accordingly, as the August 2024 VA Form 10182 was untimely as to these issues, an appeal as to these issues was not docketed by the Board.

Finally, the Veteran expressed disagreement with the denials of service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and an anxiety disorder with major depression on the August 2024 VA Form 10182.  However, in December 2024, the Veteran filed a second VA Form 10182 as to these issues and elected the Evidence Submission docket.  In a March 2025 letter, the Board accepted her docket switch request for these issues, and therefore, they will be addressed in a separate Board decision.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for sleep apnea.  At a January 2024 Higher-Level Review Informal Conference, she asserted that the sleep apnea was a result of her time in service.  She asserts she was a leader during her service and had to perform "suicide watches."  She contends that she was written up and harassed for wanting to step down from her leadership role.  She generally contends she has sleep apnea related to this time in service.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  A disability that resolves, or becomes asymptomatic, during the pendency of a claim may still be subject to service connection.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  However, a disability diagnosed prior to the filing of a claim must be shown to be present at some point during the pendency of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).

In an April 2023 letter, the AOJ advised the Veteran that VA had requested her service treatment records by contacting the Records Management Center in February 2023.  However, they responded stating, "No Records Available."  It was therefore determined that the records could not be located and were unavailable for review.  The letter advised the Veteran that all efforts to obtain the needed information had been exhausted, and the AOJ determined that further attempts to obtain the records would be futile.  Service treatment records submitted by the Veteran do not contain complaints, findings, or treatment for sleep apnea.

Military Treatment Facility Records from January 2013 to February 2013 also do not contain complaints, findings, or treatment for sleep apnea.

On the November 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ application for service connection for sleep apnea, the Veteran advised VA to "see attached supporting documents."  However, no documents were attached.  The Veteran also did not identify any facilities where she received treatment for the claimed disability.  In a December 2022 letter, the AOJ requested the Veteran provide VA with the documents referenced on her application.  The letter also advised the Veteran she did not indicate whether she had any treatment at a VA medical center or non-government facility and provided the Veteran with authorization forms to allow VA to request private medical treatment records.  The letter encouraged the Veteran to submit any information or evidence as soon as she could and that if the AOJ did not hear from her, a decision may be made on her claim after 30 days.   She did not submit or identify any relevant private treatment records or identify any VA medical facilities at which she received treatment for sleep apnea.

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection for sleep apnea is not warranted.  The record is void of any diagnosis for sleep apnea.

While the Veteran believes she has sleep apnea, as a layperson lacking in medical training and expertise, she is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case, and the claimed disability is not the type of disability that is capable of being diagnosed by a lay person.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  Specifically, service connection requires a showing of a current disability.  Here, the evidence does not support a finding of a sleep apnea disability at any point during the course of this appeal or recent to the filing of the claim.  As such, service connection cannot be established.

For the reasons and bases stated above, the Board finds that service connection for sleep apnea is not warranted.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not nearly in balance, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Accordingly, the claim is denied.
