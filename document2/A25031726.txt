ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for left knee disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's tinnitus had its onset in service and continued since service.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had IBS at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a respiratory disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a left knee disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for IBS have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2020 to December 2023.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. To establish service connection for a disability, the Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

While the presence of a disability at any time during the claim process can justify a grant of service connection, even where the most recent diagnosis is negative, McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007), where the evidence does not support a finding of a current disability upon which to predicate a grant of service connection, there can be no valid claim for that benefit. See Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998).

The term "disability" as used for VA purposes generally contemplates functional impairment resulting in loss of earning capacity. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1356. In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1333 (1997).

1. Tinnitus

Certain chronic diseases (e.g., hearing loss and tinnitus as organic diseases of the nervous system) may be presumptively service connected if they become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of leaving qualifying military service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. If a condition listed as a chronic disease in § 3.309(a) is noted during service but is either shown not to be chronic or the diagnosis could be legitimately questioned, then a showing of continuity of related symptomatology after discharge is required to support the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331(Fed. Cir. 2013).

Here, the Veteran asserts that he is entitled to service connection for tinnitus due to in-service noise exposure.

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that the Veteran's in-service noise exposure has been conceded because the Veteran's military duties caused him to be exposed to noise, and he had a complaint of tinnitus while in service.

Additionally, the Board observes that tinnitus is "subjective" as its existence is generally determined by whether or not the Veteran claims to experience it and, for VA purposes, tinnitus has been specifically found to be a disorder with symptoms that can be identified through lay observation alone. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). Therefore, the Veteran's statements are competent and credible evidence of a current disability of tinnitus.

Regarding nexus, the Veteran has stated that he experienced ringing in his ears that has continued since service. The Board finds this evidence supports a finding of continuity of symptomatology of the Veteran's tinnitus. Accordingly, service connection for tinnitus based on continuity of symptomatology is granted.

2. IBS

3. Respiratory disability

4. Left knee disability

The Veteran asserts he has current IBS, respiratory, and left knee disabilities that are related to service.

Regarding IBS, the Veteran underwent a VA intestinal examination in January 2023. The Veteran reported that while he was in Germany, he was having about three "soft" bowel movement per day. He says he was evaluated for this condition and was given some medicine. He said the issue has improved.

The examiner noted the Veteran does not have, nor has he ever been diagnosed with an intestinal condition. The Veteran has no signs or symptoms attributable to an intestinal condition. The examiner noted no diagnosis for IBS is warranted, and the claims file is silent for any diagnosis of IBS.

The Veteran underwent a VA respiratory examination in January 2023. The Veteran reported he had COVID-19 while in Germany. He says he has "tightness in the throat that makes it hard to breathe." He has not been evaluated for this respiratory condition. The Veteran said it has gotten worse and it makes it hard to breathe and the left side of chest goes numb sometimes. He reported that fumes from truck makes it difficult to breathe as well. He has received no treatment for the claimed condition.

The examiner noted the Veteran does not have, nor has he ever been diagnosed with a respiratory condition. Pulmonary function testing was performed with normal results. The examiner noted that no respiratory diagnosis is warranted, and the claims file is silent for any diagnosis of a respiratory condition.

The Veteran underwent a VA knee examination in January 2023. The Veteran reported a constant ache in the left knee. The Veteran denied any functional loss or impairment of the left knee. Testing on the left knee was all normal.

The Board finds that the January 2023 examination reports are due significant probative value. The VA examiner provided the opinions based on an accurate understanding of the Veteran's medical history, on the examiner's own knowledge and expertise, and on an examination of the Veteran. Furthermore, the examination reports are consistent with the other medical records, which fail to show current diagnoses of IBS, respiratory, and left knee disabilities. The Board accepts the VA examination reports as probative evidence that the Veteran does not have current IBS, respiratory, and left knee disabilities.  

In this case, the evidence of record does not contain probative evidence of IBS, respiratory, and left knee disabilities at any time proximate to, or during, the claim.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertions that he has IBS, respiratory, and left knee disabilities. However, he has not been shown to have the medical training and knowledge required to diagnose such conditions. See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1336-37.  Therefore, his assertions are not considered competent and do not weigh against the probative value of the medical treatment records, including the January 2023 VA examinations, which do not show diagnoses of IBS, respiratory, and left knee disabilities.

While the Veteran has these complaints, a complaint, or symptoms, are not a "disability" for VA purposes. The Board cannot grant service connection for a symptom. Although the Board recognizes the Veteran's sincere belief in his claims, the most persuasive evidence of record does not show that he had IBS, respiratory, and left knee disabilities at any point during or in proximity to the appeal period.

The Board is cognizant of the recent holding in Saunders v. Wilkie which stated that where pain causes functional impairment, a disability for VA compensation purposes exists, even if there is no underlying diagnosis. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). In sum, pain alone resulting in functional impairment is in fact a disability, and should not be summarily discounted as a bar to benefits based on a finding of no current diagnosis. However, the Veteran does not claim, nor do his medical records show that he experiences, any functional impairment due to his left knee pain. As such, the Veteran's left knee pain does not amount to a functional impairment of earning capacity, and Saunders is not applicable in this case.

In the absence of proof of current disabilities, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225. In this case there is an absence of proof of IBS, respiratory, and left knee disabilities during or in proximity to the appeal period. Without evidence of a current diagnoses, the Board need not address the other elements of service connection. The persuasive evidence is therefore against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application, and the claims must

be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
