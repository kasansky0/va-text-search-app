ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric disorder, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not have an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim, related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1969 to April 1972. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on an appeal from a February 2021 higher level review decision, following an October 2020 finding of a duty-to-assist error in an April 2020 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). Because of the duty-to-assist error, the February 2021 higher level review decision processed the challenge to the denial of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, in the supplemental review lane.

In January 2025 correspondence clarifying the Veteran's February 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) higher level review decision on appeal, which was processed in the supplemental review lane, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric disorder

The Veteran challenges the denial of entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD. February 2022 Notice of Disagreement. With his Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran included a June 2021 initial psychiatric evaluation, May 2021 hospital discharge documents, and an October 2019 psychological evaluation already in the record.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (2021). The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Establishing service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f); see Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 136-137 (1997). For entitlement to service connection, psychiatric disabilities must be diagnosed in conformity with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393, 404 (2020); 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a).

In the time that the Veteran's claim has been pending, VA has provided the Veteran with several PTSD or psychiatric examinations and medical opinions by three different psychiatrists. As discussed further below, the consensus of the VA examiners was that the Veteran had not had a DSM-5 acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, at any time during the pendency of or approximate to the filing of his claim for compensation. See VA examinations of January 2021, March 2019, December 2015; VA opinions of January 2021, March 2019, January 2019, December 2015. As to PTSD, the VA examiners noted the Veteran's reports of harassment in the military and stress while serving in Korea, but determined that, even if his stressor incidents qualified as PTSD stressor events, the Veteran did not meet the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. VA examinations and opinions of January 2021, March 2019, January 2019, December 2015. Further, while the VA examiners acknowledged the private medical examiners' identification of mental health symptoms, including for depression and anxiety, they all determined that his symptoms were of insufficient severity or duration to meet the DSM-5 criteria for an acquired psychiatric disorder. VA examinations and opinions of January 2021, March 2019, January 2019, December 2015.

The Veteran submitted four private medical examinations or opinions by three professionals, one an internal medicine physician, one a Ph.D. psychologist, and one a psychiatrist. In the first private medical examination, in February 2015 by an internal medicine physician, the examiner reported diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and PTSD. However, the examiner did not reference the DSM-5, much less address whether the diagnoses met the criteria in the DSM-5 as required for VA purposes. The February 2015 examination also did not address the examiner's qualifications for a psychiatric examination, or whether the examiner conducted a file or literature review to offer his opinion as to the Veteran's psychiatric diagnoses. The February 2015 examination's diagnoses, therefore, do not meet the requirements for a psychiatric diagnosis for VA purposes. See Martinez-Bodon, 32 Vet. App. at 404; 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a). 

An October 2019 private psychological examination, first filed in December 2019 but refiled with the Veteran's February 2022 Notice of Disagreement, determined that the Veteran had recurrent chronic depression with panic attack, but based the conclusion on the criteria in a version of the DSM that preceded the DSM-5 and relied on Axis V, or the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) test, a metric eliminated in the DSM-5. The same examiner provided another medical opinion less than three weeks later in November 2019, this time providing diagnoses of major recurrent chronic depression and general anxiety with panic attacks. However, the November 2019 private examination also does not cite the criteria set forth in the DSM-5 and the examination is thus insufficient to evidence a diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD. See Martinez-Bodon, 32 Vet. App. at 404; 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a). 

Moreover, the November 2019 private examiner identified a personal medical history and sentinel events that were entirely out of keeping with other examinations. Specifically, the November 2019 examiner reported a personal history of marital, family conflicts, separation, and instability, with cocaine and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) use. The other examinations were also silent as to the sentinel events cited by the November 2019 private examiner, including family and social conflict, aggression, and violent behavior. 

With the February 2022 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran submitted a June 2021 private medical opinion prepared by a psychiatrist as an initial psychiatric evaluation following the Veteran's discharge from the hospital in May 2021, which hospitalization, private hospital records indicate, was for psychiatric care. The June 2021 examiner provided diagnoses of recurrent depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms and PTSD, although the hospital had only recorded a diagnosis of major, recurrent, severe depression and without psychotic features. Moreover, as with the earlier private medical opinions, the June 2021 examiner cited Axis V and the GAF, indicating that the examiner relied on a pre-DSM-5 version of the DSM-5, such that the private June 2021 medical opinion is also insufficient to show a diagnosis for VA purposes of an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD. See Martinez-Bodon, 32 Vet. App. at 404; 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a). Because these private medical opinions failed to identify diagnoses in conformity with the criteria in the DSM-5, they are inadequate to support a diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the Veteran's claim. See Martinez-Bodon, 32 Vet. App. at 404; 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a).

In addition to the private medical opinion diagnoses that failed to conform to the requirements for a psychiatric diagnosis under the DSM-5 for VA purposes, the private medical nexus opinions were either not on point regarding the etiology of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder or were unsupported by a rationale or cited medical evidence in the claims file. The February 2015 examiner asserted simply that all of the Veteran's musculoskeletal and psychiatric disorders were secondary to the Veteran's military service. Likewise, the June 2021 private medical opinion stated only that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were "due to military traumatic experience."  These conclusory nexus opinions, lacking a rationale or citation to supporting data, are insufficient to serve as the foundation for entitlement to service connection. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (U.S. 2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (U.S. 2007).

The October 2019 and November 2019 private medical examiner, on the other hand, failed to address a link between service and the identified mental health disorders. The private examiner stated only in October 2019 that the Veteran complained that his headaches, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a knee injury were "[f]rom his military service." Although the October 2019 private medical examiner opined that the Veteran's major depression with panic attacks were "due to low self-esteem," the examiner did not relate the Veteran's self-esteem to service. Additionally, the November 2019 medical opinion, alone of all of the VA and private examinations including the same examiner's examination less than a month prior, described the history of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder as "marital[,] family conflicts[,] separation, in[]stability" and identified sentinel events of "family and social conflict[,] a[g]gression[, and] violent behavior." The singular and unsupported description of the etiology of the Veteran's mental health issues renders both the October 2019 and the November 2019 private medical opinions not credible. In any event; however, neither the October 2019 nor the November 2019 private medical opinion asserted a nexus between the Veteran's mental health symptoms and the Veteran's active-duty service. The October 2019 and November 2019 private medical opinions, containing inconsistent findings and reflecting no analysis of the data regarding the relationship between any psychiatric issues and service, thus also do not support entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD. See Nieves- Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304; Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993).

For these reasons, neither the diagnoses nor the nexus opinions of the private examiners are entitled to probative weight in this matter. In contrast, the VA examinations are consistent, competent, credible, and probative as to the nature of the Veteran's claimed acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD. 

In the first, December 2015 VA examination, the Veteran reported a stressor of serving in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The Veteran's March 2016 lay statement reiterated the stressor of working in the Korean DMZ, but also reported the discrimination and humiliation he faced during training and service which caused him to experience low self-esteem and depression.  The VA examiner accepted that the Veteran had experienced a stressor as the Veteran reported, but concluded that the Veteran's mental health symptoms nonetheless did not meet the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD or another mental health diagnosis. 

The December 2015 VA examiner concluded that the evidence reflected that the Veteran's military service and resulting mental health symptoms were not so severe as to result in mental health impairment socially, occupationally, or in other areas of functioning. The VA examiner found that the evidence of record demonstrated that the Veteran served in the U.S. armed forces until 1972, then studied at a commercial college, began working in a bank, and remained working in banking for 30 years. The examiner determined that the Veteran lived a "very successful marital, parenting, social, and occupational life." Not only was the Veteran's conduct and appearance unremarkable during the evaluation, but the VA examiner noted that the Veteran was a full-time bank manager and that the Veteran himself denied past psychiatric complaints, findings, or treatment of any mental health disorder. In a January 2019 addendum opinion to address conflicting evidence from the private medical opinions, the examiner determined that the evidence was not in conflict because, although the Veteran met the PTSD stressor criteria, the Veteran failed to meet the specific DSM-5 criteria for either PTSD or another acquired psychiatric disorder.

The March 2019 VA examiner again focused on the lack of functional impairment in the Veteran's life and the absence of mental health symptoms of such severity as to meet the criteria under the DSM-5. Once again, the examiner noted that the Veteran denied significant occupational impairment and denied any history of psychiatric or psychological intervention or treatment. As well, the Veteran presented at the examination with appropriate hygiene and conduct, including clear and logical speech. Although initially shy, the Veteran later became spontaneous and alert, with appropriate eye contact.  The examiner did note that the Veteran reported that all of his life, with worsening after his time in service, the Veteran had experienced concentration difficulties, occasional "weird" dreams, and occasional anxiety, particularly in crowds. Nonetheless, the examiner determined that the Veteran's anxiety was mild and occasional only, and not a DSM-5 diagnosable acquired psychiatric disorder. 

The March 2019 VA examiner noted that the Veteran had married in 1973, divorced in 2005, and been in a common law relationship with a partner with whom he lived in his owned home since 2011. The Veteran reported that he had nine grandchildren and had no significant interpersonal relationship difficulties. In agreement with the December 2015 VA medical examination, the March 2019 examiner noted that the Veteran had worked in banking for 30 years, in which time he also completed a Bachelor of Arts in management in 2005. As with the December 2015 VA examination, the March 2019 VA examiner concluded that, based on the evidence as set out above, the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms and his social and occupational impairment did not meet the DSM-5 criteria for any acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD.

Following the October 2020 rating decision, which included a favorable finding of a disability of recurrent chronic depression with panic attacks, and a concession of a stressor based on the Veteran's service in the Korean DMZ, VA provided the Veteran with another examination in January 2021. Once again, the VA examiner determined that the Veteran did not have PTSD conforming to the DSM-5 criteria or an acquired psychiatric disorder, other than PTSD, that conformed to the DSM-5 criteria. The Veteran reported to the January 2021 VA examiner that his interpersonal relationships were good to excellent, including with his partner and his siblings with whom he visited and spoke by telephone frequently. Additionally, the Veteran reported having a stable daily and weekly schedule in which he arose at about 5 am each morning, independently performed his personal hygiene activities, and surfed the internet. According to the Veteran, he drove to Arecibo three times a week to visit relatives and friends. The VA examiner noted, as did the prior VA examiners, the Veteran's educational background and three-decade history of work in the banking industry. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran had mild and occasional feelings of anxiety, but no history of significant social or occupational difficulties, including no hospitalizations for mental health issues or mental health treatment. 

As indicated by the discussion above, the VA examinations in January 2021, March 2019, and December 2015 all reflected the absence of diagnosable psychiatric disorders under the DSM-5 criteria. Although the VA examiners noted occasional and mild psychiatric symptoms, they all noted that the Veteran experienced no significant social or occupational impairments arising from mental health issues. 

With the February 2022 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran included copies of May 2021 hospital discharge documents which reflect that the Veteran was discharged from a local hospital after a stay of approximately five days. The discharge instructions notify the Veteran of mental health symptoms to watch out for and set out a plan of action for if the Veteran exhibits such symptoms, but do not indicate the specific reason for admission, providing only a primary diagnosis of major, recurrent, severe depression without psychotic features and a secondary diagnosis of high blood pressure. The discharge papers include no information regarding the etiology of the identified depression nor whether the diagnosis conformed to the DSM-5 criteria. 

As indicated by the discussion above, the June 2021 private medical opinion that followed the hospitalization failed to fill in the blanks as to etiology and the DSM 5 criteria. As noted, the June 2021 private medical opinion cited a version of the DSM that preceded the DSM-5 and failed to address whether the identified mental health disorders met the criteria under the DSM-5. Moreover, the identified mental health disorders of recurrent depressive disorder with severe psychotic symptoms and PTSD do not match the diagnoses set out in the hospital discharge documents of, primarily, major, recurrent, severe depression without psychotic features, and, secondarily, high blood pressure. Moreover, the June 2021 private medical opinion's conclusory and vague assertion that the Veteran's mental health symptoms and his inability to complete an engineering degree were caused by his military traumatic experiences is insufficient to demonstrate a nexus between service and the mental health symptoms associated with the Veteran's hospitalization. Thus, the hospital discharge papers alone are insufficient to demonstrate entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, and the inadequate June 2021 private medical opinion does not support entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD. See Martinez-Bodon, 32 Vet. App. at 404; 38 C.F.R. § 4.125.

Additionally, as evidence which post-dates the February 2021 higher level review decision, the May 2021 hospital discharge papers and the June 2021 private medical examination do not demonstrate a duty to assist error preexisting the February 2021 higher level review decision conducted as a supplemental review following the April 2020 rating decision.

For these reasons, the competent, credible, and probative evidence of record, namely the January 2021, March 2019, January 2019, and December 2015 VA examinations and opinions prepared by three different psychiatrists, which were uniform in their conclusions that the Veteran did not have a DSM-5 diagnosable acquired psychiatric disorder and that the Veteran's mental health issues had no significant impact on his social and occupational functioning, persuasively demonstrates that the Veteran did not have an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of his claim, related to service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (2021); Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67. Because the evidence is persuasively against the claim, there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence; therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Because the evidence is persuasively against the finding of a psychiatric disability for VA purposes under the DSM-5 criteria during the pendency of the claim, related to service, entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
