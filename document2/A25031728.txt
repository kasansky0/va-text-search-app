Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder arthritis (claimed as arthritis in shoulders) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran has a right shoulder arthritis condition that is related to his active-duty service.   

2. The probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran has a left shoulder arthritis condition that is related to his active-duty service. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right shoulder arthritis (claimed as arthritis in shoulders) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.    

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left shoulder arthritis (claimed as arthritis in shoulders) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from March 1974 to March 1977 and from January 1991 to July 1991, with additional service in the Army Reserve. 

In April 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal electing the Direct Review docket to review a March 2024 rating decision issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding all issues on appeal as described on the title page, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F. 3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table); 38 C.F.R. § § 3.303. Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after the military discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to the period of military service, establishes that the disease was incurred during the active military service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1113 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (d).

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.310. In order to prevail on the theory of secondary service connection, there must be evidence of a current disability; evidence of a service-connected disability; and evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

Additionally, certain chronic diseases, including arthritis, will be presumed related to service if it was noted as chronic in service; or if it manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period (usually one year) following separation from active duty; or if continuity of the same symptomatology has existed since service, with no intervening cause. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.307, 3.309(a)(3).

VA must consider the competency of the lay evidence and cannot outright reject such evidence on the basis that such evidence can never establish a medical diagnosis or nexus. However, this does not mean that lay evidence is necessarily always sufficient to identify a medical diagnosis, but rather only that it is sufficient in those cases where the lay person is competent and does not otherwise require specialized medical training and expertise to do so; i.e., the Board must determine whether the claimed disability is a type of disability for which a layperson is competent to provide etiology or nexus evidence. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

In determining whether the duty to assist requires that a VA medical examination be provided, or medical opinion obtained with respect to a veteran's claim for benefits, there are four factors for consideration. These four factors are: (1) whether there is competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) whether there is evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or evidence establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumption period; (3) whether there is an indication that the disability or symptoms may be associated with service or with another service-connected disability; and (4) whether there otherwise is sufficient competent medical evidence of record to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4). The third factor, in particular, is a low threshold. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b). This benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies if the competing evidence is nearly equal but does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder arthritis (claimed as arthritis in shoulders)

The Veteran contends that he has a right shoulder arthritis condition that is related to his active-duty service. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his right shoulder condition is related to his involvement in a motor vehicle accident during his active-duty service. See March 2024 VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) at 3.

As an initial matter, VA treatment records show that the Veteran was diagnosed with right shoulder arthritis in or around September 2022, more than 30 years after discharge from his last period of active-duty service. See August 2023 CAPRI at 154. As such, the Board finds the current disability element is established. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167; Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

Turning to the element of in-service injury, event, or illness, the Board observes that the Veteran's service treatment records (STR) indicate that in 1985, the Veteran complained of pain in his neck and back after a motor vehicle accident. See November 2009 STR - Medical at 52. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was involved in a motor vehicle accident during his active-duty service, and is satisfied as to the element of in-service injury or event. See Shedden, supra. The Board further notes that the Veteran's STR contain evidence of injury to the Veteran's cervical and thoracic back area at that time. Id. The Veteran was later granted service-connection for a neck condition largely due to this in-service injury. See December 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative. Accordingly, the second element of Wallin is also satisfied.

With respect to nexus, the Board notes that the Veteran's STR do not contain a diagnosis of arthritis or any other chronic or persistent right shoulder condition. See generally November 2009 STR - Medical. After the Veteran's periods of active-duty service, he continued to serve in a reserve component, and at periodic physical examinations reported no symptoms of shoulder pain. Id at 19, 32 (no arthritis or shoulder pain noted in July 2002 and January 1993). There is no medical evidence nor any clear lay evidence that the Veteran's arthritis pain began during active-duty service or within one year following discharge from active-duty service. As such, while the Board has considered service connection based on chronicity, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to presumptive service connection for arthritis as a chronic disease. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b) and 3.309(a). 

As discussed above, the Veteran's VA treatment records contain no discussion of the etiology of the Veteran's right shoulder arthritis and the Board can locate no medical evidence of any kind ascribing the Veteran's later-diagnosed arthritis to his military service, to include the 1985 motor vehicle accident. As such, the Board finds that the third element of Shedden is not satisfied and service-connection on a direct basis is not warranted. See Shedden, supra. With respect to service connection for right shoulder arthritis secondary to the Veteran's service-connected neck condition, there is similarly no medical evidence linking these two conditions anywhere in the record. Accordingly, the element of nexus is also not satisfied with respect to secondary service connection. See Wallin, supra.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes his right shoulder arthritis is related to his active-duty service and more specifically to his in-service motor vehicle accident. However, the Board finds that the question is medically complex and requires medical training and experience to address. See Davidson, supra. There is no evidence of record that the Veteran possesses such training or experience. Accordingly, his opinion is entitled to no probative weight. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir 2006).

The Board also acknowledges that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination for his right shoulder arthritis. Applying the McLendon factors, the Board notes that factor (1) is satisfied because the Veteran has been diagnosed with right shoulder arthritis. Factor (2) is also satisfied because there is evidence that the Veteran was involved in a motor vehicle accident in service. However, factor (3) is not satisfied because there is no indication at all that the Veteran's presently diagnosed right shoulder arthritis might be related to the in-service motor vehicle accident; or that the symptoms of this condition have been continuous since service; or that the condition may be due to or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected neck condition. Specifically, the Board notes a total absence of medical evidence supporting chronicity and affirmative evidence to the contrary; as well as a total absence of medical or lay evidence connecting the Veteran's right shoulder arthritis either to his in-service injury or to his service-connected neck condition. While the threshold for factor (3) is low, it is still a threshold, and in this case it has not been reached. The Board finds with respect to factor (4) that the evidence of record is sufficient to decide the claim. Accordingly, no VA examination is required and no duty to assist error occurred in not affording the Veteran one. See McLendon, supra.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds the weight of the competent and probative evidence does not support entitlement to service connection for right shoulder arthritis. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim is denied. In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

2. Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder arthritis (claimed as arthritis in shoulders)

The Veteran contends that he has a left shoulder arthritis condition that is related to his active-duty service. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his left shoulder condition is related to his involvement in a motor vehicle accident during his active-duty service. See March 2024 VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) at 3.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the shows that the Veteran has reported left shoulder pain that causes interference with housework and other activities. See March 2024 CAPRI at 360 (reporting left shoulder pain). Although no specific diagnosis of arthritis was rendered, the Board finds the current disability element is established on the basis pain and functional impairment. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167.

Next, the Board observes that the Veteran's service treatment records (STR) indicate that in 1985, the Veteran complained of pain in his neck and back after a motor vehicle accident. See November 2009 STR - Medical at 52. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was involved in a motor vehicle accident during his active-duty service, and is satisfied as to the element of in-service injury or event. See Shedden, supra. The Board further notes that the Veteran's STR contain evidence of injury to the Veteran's cervical and thoracic back area at that time. Id. The Veteran was later granted service-connection for a neck condition largely due to this in-service injury. See December 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative. Accordingly, the second element of Wallin is also satisfied.

Turning to nexus, the Board first observes that unlike his right shoulder condition, the Veteran's left shoulder condition does not appear to have been diagnosed as arthritis. Nevertheless, the Board has considered service connection based on chronicity. However, as with the Veteran's right shoulder, there is no evidence of record suggesting that the Veteran's left shoulder pain has been constant since service. See November 2009 STR - Medical at 19, 32 (no arthritis or shoulder pain noted in July 2002 and January 1993 during reserve duty physical exams). As such, service connection based on chronicity is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b) and 3.309(a).

As discussed above, the Veteran's VA treatment records contain no discussion of the etiology of the Veteran's left shoulder pain and the Board can locate no medical evidence of any kind ascribing the Veteran's later-diagnosed left shoulder pain to his military service, to include the 1985 motor vehicle accident. As such, the Board finds that the third element of Shedden is not satisfied and service-connection on a direct basis is not warranted. See Shedden, supra. With respect to service connection for left shoulder arthritis secondary to the Veteran's service-connected neck condition, there is similarly no medical evidence linking these two conditions anywhere in the record. Accordingly, the element of nexus is also not satisfied with respect to secondary service connection. See Wallin, supra.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes his left shoulder condition is related to his active-duty service and more specifically to his in-service motor vehicle accident or to his service-connected neck condition. However, the Board finds that the question is medically complex and requires medical training and experience to address. See Davidson, supra. There is no evidence of record that the Veteran possesses such training or experience. Accordingly, his opinion is entitled to no probative weight. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir 2006).

The Board also acknowledges that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination for his left shoulder arthritis. Applying the McLendon factors, the Board notes that factor (1) is partially satisfied because the Veteran has been diagnosed reported some pain and functional impairment to his left shoulder, though he has not been clearly diagnosed with any specific disability such as arthritis. Factor (2) is satisfied because there is evidence that the Veteran was involved in a motor vehicle accident in service. However, factor (3) is not satisfied because there is no indication at all that the Veteran's presently reported left shoulder pain might be related to the in-service motor vehicle accident; or that the symptoms of this condition have been continuous since service; or that the condition may be due to or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected neck condition. Specifically, the Board notes a total absence of medical evidence supporting chronicity and affirmative evidence to the contrary; as well as a total absence of medical or lay evidence connecting the Veteran's left shoulder arthritis either to his in-service injury or to his service-connected neck condition. While the threshold for factor (3) is low, it is still a threshold, and in this case it has not been reached. The Board finds with respect to factor (4) that the evidence of record is sufficient to decide the claim. Accordingly, no VA examination is required and no duty to assist error occurred in not affording the Veteran one. See McLendon, supra.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the weight of the probative evidence of record does not support entitlement to service connection for left shoulder arthritis. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim is denied. In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).
