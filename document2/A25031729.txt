ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for a neck surgical scar is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for psoriasis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veterans neck scar does not involve any characteristic of disfigurement or visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features, and, overall, he does not have one or two unstable or painful scars.

2. The Veteran's psoriasis did not manifest as characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent of the entire body; or involving at least 5 percent of exposed areas; or require intermittent systemic therapy.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for a neck surgical scar have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for psoriasis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7816.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Army from April 1989 to March 1993. 

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2023 Regional Office (RO) rating decision.

In the VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. While the Board typically considers only those factors outside the specific rating criteria when appropriate in order to best determine the level of occupational and social impairment.  See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002); Massey v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 204, 208 (1994). 

When there is a question as to which of two separate evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria required for that particular rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3. 

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Nevertheless, in cases where the Veteran's claim arises from a disagreement with the initial evaluation following the grant of service connection, the Board shall consider the entire period of claim to see if the evidence warrants the assignment of different ratings for different periods of time during these claims a practice known as "staged" ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). 

1. Entitlement to a compensable rating for a neck surgical scar

The Veteran is in receipt of a noncompensable evaluation for his neck scar under diagnostic code 7802 pertaining to superficial and nonlinear scars. 

However, the Board finds that the Veterans neck scar should be rated under diagnostic code 7800 which compensates, in part, for scars of the head, face, or neck. Under DC 7800 a 10 percent rating is warranted for one characteristic disfigurement. A 30 percent rating is warranted for disfigurement with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with two or three characteristics of disfigurement. A 50 percent rating is warranted for disfigurement with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with four or five characteristics of disfigurement. An 80 percent rating is warranted for disfigurement with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of three or more features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with six or more characteristics of disfigurement.

For VA compensation purposes, the eight characteristics of disfigurement include: scar 5 or more inches (13 or more cm.) in length; scar at least one-quarter inch (0.6 cm.) wide at widest part; surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation; scar adherent to underlying tissue; skin hypo-or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); skin texture abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly, etc.) in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); underlying soft tissue missing in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); or skin indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.). The characteristic(s) of disfigurement may be caused by one scar or by multiple scars; the characteristic(s) required to assign a particular evaluation need not be caused by a single scar in order to assign that evaluation. See Diagnostic Code 7800, Notes (1), (2).

Under Diagnostic Code 7804, a 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two unstable or painful scars; a 20 percent rating is warranted for three or four unstable or painful scars; and a 30 percent rating is warranted for five or more unstable or painful scars. An "unstable" scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804, Note (1).

At a May 2022 scar examination, the examiner noted the veteran's neck surgical scar was about 1.5 inches. The scar affected the anterior trunk and measured 4 by 0.5cm with an approximate total area of 4cm on the base of neck. The examiner noted that the Veterans scar was not painful. 

After a review of the lay and medical evidence, the Board finds that a compensable rating for pain under diagnostic code 7804 and a compensable rating under diagnostic code 7800 are not warranted at any point during the appeal period. Significantly, there is no evidence that the Veteran's neck scar involved any characteristic of disfigurement or visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features.

Further, while the Veterans representative argued that pain alone can serve as a functional impairment, the evidence does not reflect that his scar is painful. In fact, the April 2022 examiner stated that the Veteran's scar was not painful. 

There are no other applicable diagnostic codes that would provide for a higher rating as to the service-connected neck scar. As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected neck scar is best approximated by his existing non-compensable rating. Therefore, the claim is denied.

2. Entitlement to a compensable rating for psoriasis

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for psoriasis. 

The Veteran psoriasis is rated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7816, for psoriasis. 

VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018. These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after August 13, 2018. Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the veteran will be applied. The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise. Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). However, the Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.

Prior to August 13, 2018, under DC 7816, a noncompensable rating is assigned for less than 5 percent of the entire body or less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected, and no more than topical therapy required during the past 12 months. A 10 percent rating is assigned for at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body, or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected, or intermittent systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than six weeks during the past 12-month period. A 30 percent rating is assigned for 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected, or systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of six weeks or more, but not constantly during the past 12-month period. A 60 percent rating is assigned for more than 40 percent of the entire body, or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected, or constant or near- constant systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs required during the past 12- month period. Or rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DC's 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7816.

For claims filed prior to August 13, 2018, the Court held that a systematic therapy is one that that affects the entire body in its treatment of the condition at issue, and that the Board must determine (1) whether a topical treatment affects the body as a whole in treating a veteran's skin condition; and (2) whether the given treatment is "like" a corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive drug. Burton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 286 (2018). Only the second question need be addressed if the treatment is clearly systemic. Id. 

Effective August 13, 2018, VA regulations explicitly state that systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 (a).

Additionally, effective August 13, 2018, a new General Rating Formula for the Skin applies to Diagnostic Codes 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Under this formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected. A 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period. A 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period. A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period. Or rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DC's 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating for the Skin for DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in June 2021. The Veteran reported that his symptoms have stayed the same. He reported that his right cheek, chin, chest, and right and left shins were affected. The examiner indicated that the Veteran had used corticosteroids, constant/near constant in the past 12 months. Physical examination revealed no visible lesions, however Veteran claimed psoriasis on the right cheek, chin, and anterior chest. It affected less than 5 percent of his exposed skin, and less than 5 percent of his total body area. The examiner noted no functional impact. 

A May 2022 VA examination noted that psoriasis does have an impact on the Veteran's ability to work as he "always has discomfort in his skin." This examination determined the psoriasis covered less than five percent of the total body area and less than 5 percent of the exposed area. 

A February 2022 private disability benefits questionnaire revealed that the Veterans psoriasis covered less than 5 percent of the body. The examiner noted that the Veteran used an old prescription two to three times a month or needed. 

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under the pre-August 13, 2018, regulations because the Veteran's psoriasis does not more nearly approximate at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body, or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected, or; intermittent systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than six weeks during the past 12-month period.

While the evidence of record reflects the Veteran has undergone constant/near constant, treatment with corticosteroids, the Board notes that the evidence reflects such treatment has been topical. As indicated above, the Federal Circuit addressed the meaning of "systemic" and "topical" for rating skin disabilities under the regulatory criteria prior to August 31, 2018. See Johnson v. Shulkin, 862 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2017). "Systemic therapy" means treatment pertaining to or affecting the body, whereas "topical therapy" means treatment pertaining to a particular surface area. Although a topical corticosteroid treatment could meet the definition of systemic therapy if it was administered on a large enough scale such that it affected the body, this possibility does not mean that all applications of topical corticosteroids amount to systemic therapy. Johnson, 862 F.3d 1351. Such a determination should be made based on the facts of each individual case. See also Burton, 30 Vet. App. 286. In this case, the evidence indicates that the use of topical corticosteroids has been limited to the affected areas, which are noted as less than 5 percent of the Veteran's total body area. Accordingly, the Board finds that a higher rating is not warranted for use of systemic corticosteroids under the pre-August 13, 2018, regulations.

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under the August 13, 2018, regulations because the Veteran's psoriasis does not more nearly approximate characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period. The Board reiterates that the evidence of record reflects the use of corticosteroids has been administered through the skin, or topically. Effective August 31, 2018, VA regulations explicitly state that for the purposes of the skin disability ratings, "systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin." 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 (a). Thus, the Board also finds that a higher rating is not warranted for use of systemic corticosteroids under the current regulations.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects. Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). However, he does not assert, and medical treatment records do not show, that the Veteran's disability more nearly approximates the criteria in the next higher rating.

The Board has considered whether any other Diagnostic Codes related to disabilities of the skin would provide for a higher disability evaluation. However, the evidence does not reflect that he would warrant a higher rating under a different diagnostic code. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for psoriasis. In denying such a rating, the Board finds the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
