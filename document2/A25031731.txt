FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's tinnitus has been evaluated as 10?percent disabling, the maximum rating authorized under Diagnostic Code 6260.

2. Prior to August 21, 2021, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability was manifested by forward flexion limited to, at most, 60 degrees, even in contemplation of functional loss due to symptoms such as pain, fatigue, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination, or as a result of repetitive motion and/or flare-ups, without ankylosis or IVDS with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least four weeks during a 12-month period.

3.Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, since August 21, 2021, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability was manifested by forward flexion limited to 30 degrees or less but not in more severe symptoms of unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  

3. For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability resulted in no more than moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve in the right lower extremity.

4. For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability resulted in no more than moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve in the left lower extremity.

5. No formal or informal claim for service connection for a lumbar spine disability or associated radiculopathy was filed prior to November 27, 2019; and the claim for an increased disability rating for a lumbar spine disability has been continually pursued since the filing of the November 27, 2019, VA Form 21-526EZ.

6. The evidence of record reflects that on November 29, 2022, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability manifested with symptoms of radicular pain into his left lower extremity.

7. The evidence of record at the time of the reduction of the rating assigned for the Veteran's service-connected residual painful scar status post appendectomy failed to demonstrate a sustained improvement in regard to his ability to function under ordinary conditions of life and work. 

8. The evidence of record reflects that the Veteran's residual scar status post appendectomy has been painful, but it has not been unstable, 29 square centimeters, or resulted in any limitation of function.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army from May 1997 to September 1999, with additional periods of service in the Army Reserve and Army National Guard. See DPRIS Response associated with claims file March 2, 2023.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in August 2023 (tinnitus), October 2023 (low back disability, scars), December 2023 (low back disability, radiculopathy of the left and right lower extremities, left elbow, and syphilis), and on January 2, 2024 (right elbow) and January 9, 2024 (headache disability).  These rating decisions constitute supplemental claim decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023, October 2023, December 2023, and January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decisions on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for a headache disability, left and right elbow disabilities, and syphilis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board observes that the January 2024 VA Form 10182 indicates the Veteran's wish to appeal the effective dates for tinnitus, scar, low back disability, radiculopathy of the left and right lower extremities; however, as the respective rating decisions did not assign effective dates, the Board finds that the appeal of the issues of earlier effective dates for these increased rating claims are not properly before the Board.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects their ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Rating Schedule. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). Where, as here, entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 510 (2007).

1. Entitlement to an increased disability rating higher than 10 percent for tinnitus.

The Veteran contends the severity of his tinnitus disability warrants an increased rating higher than the 10 percent currently assessed.  January 2024 Notice of Disagreement; February 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

Under DC 6260, a rating of 10 percent rating is assigned for tinnitus. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6260. This is the maximum schedular rating available for tinnitus. Id.; Smith v. Nicholson,?451 F.3d 1344?(Fed. Cir. 2006). As VA's Rating Schedule expressly contemplates tinnitus, VA may not rate it by analogy. Copeland v. McDonald,?27?Vet. App.?333, 337?(2015). As there is no legal basis upon which VA may award a?higher?schedular evaluation for the?tinnitus, the Board denies the Veteran's appeal. Sabonis v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?426?(1994).  The Board recognizes that the Veteran reported that his tinnitus results in constant ringing in his ears.  February 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ.  However, this impairment is fully contemplated and compensated by the maximum schedular 10 percent rating assigned for the Veteran's tinnitus.  

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Yancy v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?484, 495 (2016); Doucette v. Shulkin, 38?Vet. App.?366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).  

2. Entitlement to an increased initial rating, higher than 20 percent, for a service connected lumbar spine disability.

3. Since September 17, 2022, entitlement to an increased rating, higher than 40 percent, for a service connected lumbar spine disability.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an increased initial disability evaluation for his service connected lumbar spine disability based on the severity of his symptoms. January 2024 VA Form 10182; December 2020, July 2021, and February 2023 VA Forms 21-526EZ. 

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and endurance. Functional loss may be due to the absence or deformity of structures or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior in undertaking the motion. Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled. 38 C.F.R. § 4.40. In Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that, although pain may cause a functional loss, "pain itself does not rise to the level of functional loss as contemplated by VA regulations applicable to the musculoskeletal system." Rather, pain may result in functional loss, but only if it limits the ability "to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, or endurance." Id., quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40.

With respect to joints, in particular, the factors of disability reside in reductions of normal excursion of movements in different planes. Inquiry will be directed to more or less than normal movement, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, swelling, deformity or atrophy of disuse. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 ; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).

The intent of the Rating Schedule is to recognize actually painful, unstable or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint, even in the absence of arthritis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 ; Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011). In this regard, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that "[t]he joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non weight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint." Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016). Further, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is applicable to the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities involving actually painful, unstable or malaligned joints or periarticular regions, regardless of whether the DC under which the disability is evaluated is predicated on range of motion measurements. Southall-Norman v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 346 (2016).

The Board notes that the AOJ granted service connection for the Veteran's back disability in a January 2020 rating decision, assigning an initial 20 percent rating effective November 27, 2019.  Under the AMA, to continuously pursue a claim for an increased initial rating, the Veteran needed to file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995), a Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996), or a Board appeal (VA Form 10182) within one year of the February 2020 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)(1).  Instead, the Veteran filed a series of VA Forms 21-526EZ, seeking an increased rating for his back.  In a November 2022 rating decision, the AOJ increased the Veteran's back disability rating to 40 percent effective September 17, 2022, the date of the VA Form 21-526EZ received that date seeking an increased rating.  The most recent increased rating claim for the back disability was received on February 12, 2023.  The AOJ adjudicated the February 2023 increased rating claim in the December 2023 rating decision which continued the 40 percent rating from September 17, 2022.  

However, the Board also notes that on September 2, 2023, the AOJ notified the Veteran that a system error may have resulted in VA failing to establish a claim based on the Veteran's past submissions.  Therefore, in the October 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ confirmed the initial 20 percent rating for the Veteran's back disability assigned from November 27, 2019 to September 16, 2022.  

In light of the circumstances of this case, the Board finds the issue on appeal is the initial rating for the Veteran's back disability in excess of 20 percent prior to September 17, 2022, and in excess of 40 percent from September 17, 2022 to December 2023 (the date of the notification letter for the December 2023 rating decision on appeal).  

Prior to September 16, 2022, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability has been rated as 20 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5237, 5242, and 5242-5243.  Since September 17, 2022, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability has been rated as 40 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242-5243.  January 2024 Rating Decision - Code sheet.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

Effective February 7, 2021, the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended. See 85 Fed. Reg. 230 (Nov. 30, 2020). These amendments revised select diagnostic codes "to ensure that this portion of the rating schedule uses current medical terminology and provides detailed and updated criteria for the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities." Id. In this regard, IVDS is rated under DC 5243 and provides such disability is evaluated under either the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (General Rating Formula) or the Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes (IVDS Rating Formula), whichever method results in the higher evaluation when all disabilities are combined. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.25 (combined ratings table).

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent disability rating is awarded for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of?50 percent?or more of the height.?38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.?38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. A?50 percent?rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.?38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine. 

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.?Id.?at Note 1. 

Unfavorable ankylosis is defined as "a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching."?Id.?at Note 5. Additionally, fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) is "always" considered favorable ankylosis.?Id.? 

The IVDS Rating Formula provides a 10 percent evaluation when there are incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least one week but less than 2 weeks during the past 12 months and a 20 percent evaluation when there are incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks during the past 12 months. A 40 percent evaluation is warranted when there are incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks during the past 12 months. A 60 percent evaluation is warranted when there are incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the past 12 months. Note (1) provides that an incapacitating episode is a period of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.

If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g). If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. 38 U.S.C. § 5110. As of February 7, 2021, the amended criteria for DC 5242 and 5243 separated degenerative disc disease from intervertebral disc syndrome; however, the rating criteria under such DCs were unchanged.

As service connection for the Veteran's back disability was in effect from November 27, 2019 which is before the February 2021 regulatory changes went into effect, the Board must apply the pre- and post-February 2021 rating criteria when evaluated the Veteran's claim, although the post-February 2021 rating criteria may not be applied prior to that date. 

The Board observes the evidence of record provides conflicting information regarding the nature and severity of the Veteran's low back disability.  Nevertheless, for the following reasons, the Board finds the persuasive weight of the evidence of record supports entitlement to an initial disability rating for service connected lumbar spine disability of 20 percent, but no higher, through August 20, 2021, and resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to an increased disability rating of 40 percent, but no higher, thereafter.

Initially, the Board notes that none of the clinicians who have provided VA examinations or VA-contracted examinations had indicated that the Veteran had any episodes of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that required physician-prescribed bed rest for evaluation under Diagnostic Code 5243.  The VA Medical Center (VAMC) treatment records similarly do not suggest that the Veteran's back disability required physician-prescribed bed rest.

The AOJ assigned the initial 20 percent rating for the Veteran's lumbar spine disability based on the Veteran's forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees, guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait, and a combined range of motion greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees, which was supported by the findings from a January 2020 VA-contracted examination. February 2020 Rating Decision; January 2020 Back Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). At the time of the January 2020 examination, the Veteran was reporting flareups of back pain only with impact activities.  

By the time of the July 2020 VA-contracted examination, the Veteran was reporting progressively painful stiffness and intermittent back spasm, flareups of pain occurring "several times per week" lasting for one to several hours, and precipitated by activities of daily living involving prolonged sitting, standing, walking, repetitive bending, or heavy lifting/carrying.  July 2020 Back Conditions DBQ.  Although the examination was not conducted during a flareup, the clinician estimated the Veteran's would be limited to 40 degrees forward flexion, 5 degrees extension, and 15 degrees each for right and left lateral flexion and lateral rotation.   Thus, at the time of the July 2020 examination, the Veteran's flareups, which occurred several times each week, resulted in limitation in range of motion consistent with not more than a 20 percent disability rating. 

When the Veteran was provided a VA examination in August 2021, he reported worsening back pain which was now "constant," and included "daily" flareups of severe burning pain which precluded him from bending or performing heavy lifting, or prolonged sitting, standing or walking.  VA Treatment records received March 29, 2023, DOS August 21, 2021.  Although the examination was not conducted during a flareup, the clinician estimated the Veteran's would be limited to just 5 degrees in forward flexion, extension, and for both right and left lateral flexion and lateral rotation.   Thus, at the time of the August 2021 VA examination, the Veteran's daily flareups resulted in limitation in range of motion consistent with a 40 percent disability rating.

The Board notes that examinations since August 21, 2021, have revealed that the frequency of the Veteran's flareups has varied, with the Veteran denying flareups in December 2021, February 2022, and July 2022, but that he has consistently reported experiencing "daily" flareups of moderate to severe pain lasting for several hours at VA-contracted examinations since such time. See October 2022, July 2023, and November 2023.  The examining clinicians' estimates of the Veteran's range of motion during flareups varied from the August 2021 examination through the most recent November 2023 examination, with estimates consistent with either a 20 or 40 percent disability rating. The Board finds this conflicting evidence at least in equipoise, and as there is no objective evidence of any actual improvement in the Veteran's lumbar spine disability during this period, resolves reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds entitlement to the higher 40 percent disability rating is warranted since the August 21, 2021, VA examination. 

Nevertheless, while there is evidence that the Veteran was experiencing daily flareups of pain which resulted in limitations consistent with a 40 percent lumbar spine disability evaluation as of August 21, 2021, the Board observes that the evidence of record establishes that the Veteran did not have ankylosis, or the functional equivalent thereof, during the period on appeal. See Back Conditions DBQs dated January 2020, July 2020, August 2021, December 2021, February 2022, July 2022, October 2022, July 2023, and November 2023; Capri records associated with claims file March 29, 2023, date of service (DOS) January 23, 2023. As such, the criteria for entitlement to a rating higher than 40 percent for a lumbar spine disability have been met.

In so finding, the Board is cognizant that it may not deny a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when the ameliorative effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 61 (2012); see also Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798 (CAVC, March 12, 2025). The diagnostic codes pertaining to the lumbar spine do not contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication.  The evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has been prescribed Tylenol, naproxen, Lidocaine and Gabapentin for his lumbar spine symptoms. November 2023 Back Conditions DBQ.  As noted above, the Veteran takes pain medication for his low back disability. However, while he has reported that his flare-ups were manifested by additional pain and some additional loss of motion, the evidence of record suggests medication has not been effective.  See Kirshbaum v. Collins, No. 23-2451, (CAVC March 19, 2025) (mem dec) (Toth, J.); July 2022 and October 2022 Back Conditions DBQ; VA treatment records received March 29, 2023, DOS October 6, 2022.  Moreover, there is no evidence of record which suggests the additional loss of motion during a flareup produced ankylosis, or the functional equivalent thereof, of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  Thus, the record does not show that the Veteran would meet the criteria for a higher, 50 percent rating, but for the ameliorative effects of medication.

Consistent with VA's duty to maximize benefits, the Board has also considered whether a separate rating is warranted based on the July 2023 VA-contracted clinician's notation of "bowel movement to the extent of having stool incontinence" which was listed as a neurologic abnormality associated with the Veteran's lumbar spine disability.  See?Morgan v. Wilkie, 31?Vet. App.?162, 167 (2018); Bailey?v. Wilkie, 33?Vet. App.?188 (2021).  Nevertheless, the Board has determined the July 2023 clinician's notation outweighed by the other evidence of record prior to the rating decision on appeal, including the findings of the other clinicians throughout the period on appeal who noted no such related neurological abnormality.  

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence of record supports a finding that an initial rating of 20 percent, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's lumbar spine disability through August 20, 2021.  As the evidence persuasively weighs against an initial rating in excess 20 percent prior to August 20, 2021, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.?38 U.S.C. § 5107?(b);?38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough,?21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).   As the evidence of record since August 20, 2021, is conflicting but in relative equipoise regarding the severity of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, and awards entitlement to an increased rating of 40 percent, but no higher, since August 20, 2021.

The Veteran has not raised any other issues nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 495 (2016); Doucette v. Shulkin, 38 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

4. Entitlement to an increased rating higher 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an increased disability evaluation for his service connected radiculopathy of the right lower extremity.  January 2024 VA Form 10182; February 2023 VA Forms 21-526EZ. 

The period on appeal stems from the February 12, 2023, the filing date of the Veteran's claim for an increased rating, plus the one-year look-back period. Gaston v. Shinseki,?605 F.3d 979, 982?(Fed. Cir. 2010). Since December 17, 2020, the date of service connection, the Veteran's radiculopathy of the right lower extremity has been rated as 10 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 8520.  January 2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet.

Diagnostic Code 8520 provides the rating criteria for paralysis of the sciatic nerve. Under this code, a 10 percent rating is warranted for mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; a 20 percent rating for moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; a 40 percent rating for moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; and a 60 percent rating for severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve with marked muscular atrophy. Further, an 80 percent rating is warranted where there is complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve where the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

Neuralgia, cranial or peripheral, characterized usually by a dull and intermittent pain, of typical distribution so as to identify the nerve, is to be rated on the same scale, with a maximum equal to moderate incomplete paralysis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124. The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type pictured for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. Neither the Rating Schedule nor the regulations provide definitions for descriptive words such as "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe."  Spellers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 211, 219 (2018) ("DC 8520 does not define 'mild,' 'moderate,' 'moderately severe,' or 'severe,' or generally associate those terms with specific symptoms").  Although the Board has at times attempted to define these terms using dictionary definitions, this has often proved problematic in clearly articulating the benchmark it employs to reach its conclusions.  

The Board "is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases." Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018). Relevant to this case are M21-1 provisions which include detailed definitions of "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" as found in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. 

The M21-1 describes mild incomplete paralysis as a disability "limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a smaller area." Part V, sbpt. iii, ch. 12, sec. A.2.c. Moderate incomplete paralysis, per the M21-1, should be "reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment," where the sensory involvement covers "a larger area in the nerve distribution." Id. M21-1 examples of a moderate disability include "motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate." Id. And the M21-1 provides that a moderately severe evaluation is available when there is "[m]otor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a higher level of limitation or disability." Id. Atrophy may, but need not, be present for a moderately severe rating. Severe incomplete paralysis, per the M21-1, is reserved for a very high level of limitation when there is "motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished hyperactive reflexes)." Id. Trophic changes may be seen in "severe longstanding neuropathy cases." Even though severe incomplete paralysis should show findings less than representative for complete impairment of the nerve, sign/symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve may be present. In addition, "neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain" should be rated as high as severe. Id.

The Board applies them in the instant case to clearly and fully articulate the Board's understanding of these terms and the benchmark employed in reaching its conclusion. Id.; see also LeMon v. McDonough, No. 21-3949, 2022 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1998, *7 (Dec. 16, 2022) (mem dec) (Toth, J.).

Upon review, the Board finds that entitlement to an increased 20 percent rating, but not higher, for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity is warranted.  In this regard, at the November 2023 VA-contracted clinician documented "moderate" constant pain, "moderate" intermittent pain, "moderate" paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and "moderate" numbness in the right lower extremity on one report and "severe" pain, paresthesias/dysesthesias, and numbness in a contemporaneous report.  November 2023 Back Conditions DBQ and Peripheral Nerves Condition DBQ.  Nevertheless, at the time, the examination revealed no muscle atrophy and normal reflexes at the knees and ankles bilaterally. Id. Based on such subjective symptoms and objective examination, the examiner determined that the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy resulted in, at most, moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve. November 2023 Peripheral Nerves Conditions DBQ.  Moreover, a finding of not more than a "moderate" incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve of the right lower extremity is not contradicted by either the October 2022 or July 2023 examining clinicians. October 2022 Peripheral Nerves DBQ (finding "moderate" incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve on the right; July 2023 Peripheral Nerves DBQ (noting a normal sciatic nerve examination). 

The Board acknowledges that the July 2023 VA-contracted clinician argued that the Veteran's sciatic nerve was "normal," but finds this conclusion entitled to less probative weight, as the same examiner failed to provide any rationale for this conclusion in light of the examination which also noted a decreased sensory examination of the Veteran's right lower extremity, as well as constant moderate pain and moderate paresthesias, dysesthesias, and numbness of the right lower extremity.

The persuasive weight of the evidence of record does not reflect symptoms more consistent with a moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve. Thus, the weight of the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran suffers with no more than a moderate incomplete paralysis, consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 4.124, and a rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted for right lower extremity radiculopathy at any time during the period on appeal.  At the November 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted the Veteran did not have reduced muscle strength, atrophy, weakness, or diminished hyperactive reflexes such that his right lower extremity nerve impairment would be considered to more nearly approximately severe incomplete paralysis.  The Veteran has not raised any other issues nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 495 (2016); Doucette v. Shulkin, 38 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

5. Entitlement to an increased initial rating, higher than 10 percent, for service connected left lower extremity radiculopathy.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an increased initial evaluation for his service-connected left lower extremity radiculopathy based on the severity of his symptoms. January 2024 VA Form 10182; February 2023 VA Forms 21-526EZ. 

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Rating Schedule.?38?U.S.C. §?1155;?38?C.F.R. §§?4.1, 4.2, 4.10. 

When the appeal arises from an?initial?assigned?rating, consideration must be given to whether staged ratings should be assigned to reflect entitlement to a higher rating at any point during the pendency of the claim. Fenderson v. West,?12?Vet. App.?119?(1999). Staged ratings are also appropriate in any increased rating claim in which distinct time periods with different ratable symptoms can be identified. Hart v. Mansfield,?21?Vet. App.?505?(2007). 

For the entire appeal period, which stems from February 12, 2023, the date of service connection, the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy has been rated as 10 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 8520.  January 2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet.  

As detailed above, under this code, a 10 percent rating is warranted for mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; a 20 percent rating for moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; a 40 percent rating for moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; and a 60 percent rating for severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve with marked muscular atrophy. Further, an 80 percent rating is warranted where there is complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve where the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  The Board applies the same definitions to the terms in this section as described above when addressing right lower extremity radiculopathy.

Upon review, the Board finds that entitlement to an increased 20 percent rating, but not higher, for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity is warranted.  In this regard, at the November 2023 VA-contracted examination, the Veteran reported "moderate" constant pain, "mild" intermittent pain, "moderate" paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and "moderate" numbness in the left lower extremity.  November 2023 Peripheral Nerve Conditions and Back Conditions DBQs.   At that time, the examination revealed normal muscle strength, without atrophy; normal reflexes at the knees and ankles bilaterally; and a normal sensory exam of the left lower extremity. November 2023 Back Conditions DBQ.  Based on such subjective symptoms and objective examination, the examiner determined that the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy resulted in, at most, moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve. November 2023 Peripheral Nerves Conditions DBQ. 

The Board acknowledges that the July 2023 VA-contracted clinician argued that the Veteran's sciatic nerve was "normal," but finds this conclusion entitled to less probative weight, as the same examiner failed to provide any rationale for this conclusion in light of the examination which also noted constant mild pain, intermittent mild pain, as well as mild paresthesias, dysesthesias, and numbness of the left lower extremity.  

The persuasive weight of the evidence of record does not reflect symptoms more consistent with a moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve. Thus, the weight of the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran suffers with no more than a moderate incomplete paralysis, consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 4.124, and a rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted for left lower extremity radiculopathy at any time during the period on appeal. At the November 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted the Veteran did not have reduced muscle strength, atrophy, weakness, or diminished hyperactive reflexes such that his left lower extremity nerve impairment would be considered to more nearly approximately severe incomplete paralysis. The Veteran has not raised any other issues nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 495 (2016); Doucette v. Shulkin, 38 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

6. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connected left lower extremity radiculopathy.

The Veteran contends that an effective date earlier than February 12, 2023, is warranted for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy.? See January 2024 VA Form 10182.

The assignment of?effective dates?of awards is governed by?38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.? Generally, the?effective date?of an award of?service connection is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.?Id. The?effective date?of an evaluation and award of compensation on an original claim for compensation will be the day following separation from active duty service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within 1 year after separation from service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.?38 U.S.C. § 5110?(a)-(b)(1);?38 C.F.R. § 3.400?(b)(2).? 

Claims mean a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p). Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim was a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit.?38 C.F.R. § 3.1?(p) (2014). The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, were: (1) intent to apply for benefits; (2) identification of the benefits sought; and (3) communication in writing. Brokowski v. Shinseki,?23?Vet. App.?79, 84?(2009).? 

For the following reasons, the evidence of record establishes entitlement to an effective date of November 29, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection of left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with the service connection lumbar spine disability. 

There is no evidence of record indicating the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for a lumbar spine disability or an associated left lower extremity radiculopathy within a year of his discharge from service in September 1999.  Instead, on November 27, 2019, the VA received a claim for compensation submitted by the Veteran seeking disability benefits for, in pertinent part, a back condition, which was followed by a February 2020 rating decision granting service connection for a lumbar spine disability.? See November 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ; February 2020 Rating Decision.? As discussed above, in light of the circumstances has construed the Veteran's appeal as a claim for an increased initial rating for his back disability.

Consistent with VA's duty to maximize benefits, the Board must consider all possible schedular bases for separate ratings, including?secondary?service connection. See?Morgan v. Wilkie, 31?Vet. App.?162, 167 (2018).?In this regard, the Court has held?that?38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2)?requires that, when entitlement to?secondary?service connection is raised, a formal claim for?secondary?service connection need not be filed, rather, VA must consider those "complications" in connection with the claim on appeal. See?Bailey?v. Wilkie, 33?Vet. App.?188 (2021). Moreover, Note 1 to the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine specifically states that the AOJ must evaluate any associated objective neurologic abnormalities separately under the appropriate diagnostic code.  Therefore, the Board finds the Veteran's claim for an initial increased rating for his back disability included a claim for nerve impairment, including radiculopathy of the left lower extremity.  

With regard to the date entitlement to service connection for a left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with the lumbar spine disability arose, the Board observes that the evidence of record reflects that the Veteran reported to his primary care provider in November 2022 of radiating pain down his right leg into the last three toes of the right foot, also with "some pain in left leg as well but much less". See Capri records associated with claims file March 29, 2023, DOS November 29, 2022. This appears to be the first reference in the evidence of record to left-sided radicular systems into the lower extremity.  This is consistent with each of the prior VA examinations and VA-Contracted examinations, which did not report radicular pain or signs and symptoms of the left lower extremity at any time prior to November 29, 2022.  See February 2020, July 2020, and July 2022 Back Conditions DBQ (finding no radicular pain or signs or symptoms of radiculopathy); August 2021, December 2021, February 2022, and October 2022 Back Conditions DBQ (documenting no left lower extremity pain or radicular signs or symptoms); October 2022 Peripheral Nerves Conditions DBQ (noting a normal left-sided sciatic nerve examination).  

In light of the above, the Board finds the evidence persuasively weighs against an effective date earlier than November 29, 2022, for the grant of service connection for service connection of left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with the service connection lumbar spine disability. Consequently, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another, is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application). Therefore, an effective date earlier than November 29, 2022, for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy is not warranted.? 

7. Propriety of the reduction of the rating for service connected residual painful scar status post appendectomy from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective October 11, 2023.

By way of background, in a February 2020 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for residual painful scar with a 10 percent disability evaluation pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7804, effective November 27, 2019. February 2020 Notification Letter and Rating Codesheet.  The Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating in December 2020, however, due to a processing error, an examination was not requested by the AOJ for these disabilities until September 2023. September 2023 Notification Letter and Exam Request. Following the VA-contracted examination, the AOJ reduced the disability evaluation for residual painful scar status post appendectomy from 10 percent to 0, effective October 11, 2023 in the October 2023 rating decision on appeal. The Veteran has challenged the propriety of the reduction as well as the assigned ratings for residual painful scar status post appendectomy and residual anterior scar, contending that he is entitled to compensable evaluations for his service-connected scars. January 2024 VA Form 10182. 

As an initial matter, the Board observes that in a rating reduction, VA must comply with the notice procedures of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e), where there is a reduction in compensation payments currently being made. Tatum v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 139 (2010). The Board observes that the result of this reduction for painful scar status post appendectomy from 10 to 0 percent did not have the effect of reducing the Veteran's overall combined evaluation for compensation (80 percent) or his resulting monthly disability payment. October 2023 Rating Decision Codesheet. Thus, the notice requirements under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) do not apply.

A veteran's rating shall not be reduced unless an improvement in the disability is shown to have occurred. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155. Prior to reducing a veteran's disability, VA is required to comply with several general regulations applicable to all rating-reduction cases, regardless of the rating level or the length of time that the rating has been in effect. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10, 4.13; see also Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420 (1993). These provisions impose a clear requirement that VA rating reductions be based upon review of the entire history of the Veteran's disability. See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). Such review requires VA to ascertain, based upon review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability and whether the examination reports reflecting such change are based upon thorough examinations.

In any rating reduction case, not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred, but also that the improvement actually reflects an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. See Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 350 (2000); see also Murphy v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 510, 517 (2014). It is essential, both in the examination and evaluation of the disability, that each be viewed in relation to its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. If an examination report does not contain sufficient detail, or the diagnosis is not supported by the findings on the examination report, then it must be returned as inadequate for rating purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2.

Nevertheless, the Court has stated that certain regulations "impose a clear requirement that VA rating reductions, as with all VA rating decisions, be based upon review of the entire history of the veteran's disability." Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420 (1993) (referring to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.13). 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c), applicable to ratings such as this one in effect for less than 5 years, requires improvement before an evaluation is reduced. Implicit in the regulations is that any improvement must be of such a nature as to warrant a change in the evaluation. The Brown case articulated three questions that must be addressed in determining whether a rating reduction was warranted by the evidence. First, a rating reduction case requires ascertaining "whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability." Second, it must be determined whether the examination reports reflecting such change were based upon thorough examinations. Third, it must be determined whether the improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 421.

With respect to the reduction from 10 percent to zero percent for the Veteran's service connected painful scar status post appendectomy, a review of the AOJ's October 2023 rating decision, demonstrates that the AOJ analyzed the issue of reduction of the 10 percent evaluation just as it would a claim for an increased rating, but did not address whether there was an actual improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  In fact, the October 2023 VA-contracted examination documents the Veteran's report of a residual scar since 1998 that continues to present with intermittent pain and itching.  

The Court has stated that both decisions by the AOJ and by the Board that do not apply the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344, when applicable, are void ab initio (i.e., at their inception). Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 413; see also Hayes v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 67, 73 (1996) (where VA reduces the appellant's rating without observing applicable laws and regulations the rating is void ab initio and the Court will set aside the decision).

As the rating decision that accomplished the reduction of the 10 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service connected service connected painful scar status post appendectomy did not properly apply the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344, the reduction is void. The appropriate remedy in this case is a restoration of the 10 percent disability rating for service-connected service connected painful scar status post appendectomy. Hayes, 9 Vet. App. at 73 (improper reduction reinstated effective date of reduction).

8. Entitlement to an increased disability rating, higher than 10 percent, for service connected residual painful scar status post appendectomy.

9. Entitlement to an increased compensable disability rating for service connected anterior scar status post appendectomy.

VA received the Veteran's claim for an increased ratings for his service connected residual painful scar and residual anterior scar status post appendectomy in December 2020. VA Form 21-526EZ.  Thus, the appeal period stems from the date of receipt of such claim, plus the one-year look-back period. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Throughout the period on appeal, a 10 percent disability evaluation has been assigned for residual painful scar pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7804, and a noncompensable (zero) percent evaluation has been assigned for residual anterior scar pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7802. February 2020 Notification Letter and Rating Codesheet.  

Diagnostic Code 7802 is for burn scars or scars due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.?38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802. Under this diagnostic code, a higher 10 percent disability rating is warranted if the scar that covers an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater. Diagnostic Code 7804 applies for scars that are unstable or painful. An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.?38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804, Note (1). Diagnostic Code 7804 provides a 10 percent rating for one or two scars that are unstable or painful, and a higher 20 percent rating for three or four scars that are unstable or painful. Also, under this diagnostic code, if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, VA is to add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. Id. at Note (2). Also, scars evaluated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under 7804, when applicable. Id. at Note (3).  

38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800 applies to scar(s) and disfigurement of the head, face, or neck.?38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7801 applies to scar(s) not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7805 applies to other scars and other effects of scars evaluated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7804. 

The Veteran does not contend that his scar is located on his head, face, or neck, that it is associated with underlying soft tissue damage, or that it covers an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater; therefore, a compensable rating is not warranted under evaluated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7801, or 7802. 

The Veteran was afforded an examination with a VA-contracted clinician in October 2023.  October 2023 Scars/Disfigurement DBQ. The examining clinician documented the Veteran's scar as being located on the right lower abdomen, that it was not unstable, that it did cause pulsating pain, and that it did not cover an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater with the clinician estimating that the scar covered a combined total area of not more than 1.8 square centimeters. The clinician found no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms (such as muscle or nerve damage) associated with this scar or disfigurement of the head, face or neck. 

The October 2023 clinician's finding that the Veteran's service-connected residual painful scar is painful but not unstable, is consistent with the Veteran's lay statements regarding the frequency and severity of his symptoms.  Moreover, the Veteran has not reported any symptomatology or impairment associated with his scar to the VA-contracted clinician or other treating providers, nor provided other lay statements for consideration in support of this claim. See, e.g., December 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ; January 2024 VA Form 10182; February 2020 and October 2023 Scars/Disfigurement DBQ; STR associated with claims file September 16, 1999, DOS May 13, 1999, and July 7, 1999.  

As the persuasive weight of the evidence of record weighs against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable.?38 U.S.C. §5107?(b);?38 C.F.R. §4.3. See Lynch v. McDonough,?21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another, is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  As such, the Board finds that a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7802 is not warranted, and entitlement to a 10 percent rating, but no higher, under Diagnostic Code 7804 for one painful but stable scar is warranted.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service Connection

Service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) competent evidence of a causal relationship, or nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), the VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

1. Entitlement to service connection for syphilis is remanded.

The Veteran contends he acquired syphilis during active duty service, with continuation of symptoms since such time.  February 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; July 2023 Infectious Disease DBQ.  Although the Veteran's claim states that he acquired syphilis due to military sexual trauma, the Board notes the Veteran is service connected for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to sexual harassment, not a military sexual trauma.  See December 2020 rating decision; December 2020 VA PTSD Examination.

Under the AMA, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Here the Board finds remand is warranted to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  First, the Board notes that it appears the Veteran's service department records are incomplete.?For example, on the February 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran reported that he served in the Army Reserves through April 2005, and the available evidence associated with the claims file indicates that the Veteran was assigned to the Army Reserves for a period of service through April 2005  However, these records also indicated the Veteran had additional Army National Guard service from September 1999 through April 2002.  DPRIS Response associated with claims file March 2, 2023.  Nevertheless, the AOJ does not appear to have made attempts to service the Veteran's service treatment records from his National Guard service, nor has the AOJ conducted sufficient development to identify the Veteran's specific periods of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA for his National Guard and Army Reserves service from 1999 through 2005.  As the VA has a?duty to assist?claimants in obtaining evidence needed to substantiate a claim, including military records and "relevant records pertaining to the claimant's active military, naval, air, or space service that are held or maintained by a governmental entity," the AOJ's failure to attempt to obtain these records, or to make a formal finding if reasonably certain such records do not exist or further efforts to obtain them would be futile, constitutes a?pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c) (2), (3). 

Further, remand is warranted for the AOJ to obtain an adequate medical opinion which addresses each of the Veteran's contention that he acquired syphilis during active service.  To this end, the VA has a duty to address all arguments put forth by a claimant and/or theories under which entitlement to benefits sought may be awarded. ?See Szemraj v. Principi,?357 F.3d 1370, 1371?(Fed. Cir. 2004); Roberson v. Principi,?251 F.3d 1378, 1384?(Fed. Cir. 2001) (explaining that the Board must consider all potential theories of entitlement raised by the evidence.); Buckley v. West, 12?Vet. App.?76, 83 (1998) (noting that where the agency of original jurisdiction and the Board have failed to address an argument reasonably raised by a claimant in support of a claim over which the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) has jurisdiction, the CAVC will remand the claim directing the Board to address the argument).  Once the VA provides a veteran with an examination in a service connection claim, the examination must be?adequate. Barr v. Nicholson,?21?Vet. App.?303, 311?(2007). 

The Veteran contends that he contracted syphilis during active duty service and has suffered residual symptoms, including rash, since such time.  While the VA-contracted clinician provided a positive medical opinion that the Veteran's syphilis was at least as likely as not related to his active service; such appears to be based on an inaccurate account of the Veteran's military service.  November 2023 Infectious Disease DBQ (relating that the Veteran service including serving in the United States Marine Corps from April 2018 through April 2023).  An opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460-461 (1993); Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229, 232 (1993). Consequently, the failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand is warranted for an addendum medical opinion. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right elbow disability, claimed as joint pains.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a left elbow disability, claimed as joint pains.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a headache disorder is remanded.

The Veteran contends he developed right and left elbow joint pain and headaches as a result of active duty service.  February 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; July 2023 and November 2023 Elbow and Forearm Conditions DBQ; July 2023 Headaches DBQ.  The Veteran also contends his headaches are secondary to his service-connected tinnitus. See February 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

With regards to the above-listed claims, additional development is needed to allow the Board to make a fully-informed decision. 

As indicated above, remand is required for the AOJ to correct a?pre-decisional duty to assist error, to obtain the relevant service department records held or maintained by a governmental entity, or to make a formal finding if reasonably certain such records do not exist or further efforts to obtain them would be futile. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c) (2), (3). 

As it stands, the evidence of record contains no adequate medical opinions for these claims on which the Board my rely.  The medical opinions of the July 2023 VA-contracted examiner, who provided a positive opinion that the Veteran's "bilateral joint pains" were as least as likely as not due to his duties at Kuwait, and that the Veteran's diagnosis of "headache" was "due to the burning trashpits," were supported with conclusory statements that burning trash pits can cause symptoms such as headache and that the Veteran's current right and left elbow disabilities were related to his service in Kuwait.  As such, the July 2023 examiner's opinions are inadequate and entitled to no probative weight. See Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998)(explaining that whether a physician provides a basis for his or her medical opinion goes to the weight or credibility of the evidence in the adjudication of the merits).  The Board also finds the negative opinion of the December 2023 clinician inadequate.  December 2023 Medical Opinion DBQ. In arguing that the Veteran did not have any pathology to support a diagnosis of migraine, the clinician did not address the Veteran's lay statements regarding his headache symptoms, or the diagnosis of "headache" rendered by the July 2023 VA-contracted examiner.   

With regard to the Veteran's claim for right and left elbow disorders, the November 2023 examining clinician initially provided a positive opinion regarding the right elbow as secondary to the Veteran's service connected radiculopathy of the right lower extremity, but thereafter, provided a negative addendum opinion that the Veteran's current diagnoses of bilateral elbow arthritis and right elbow strain were less likely than not proximately due to or the result of his service-connected radiculopathy of the right lower extremity.  July 2023 and November 2023 Medical Opinion DBQ; December 2023 C&P Exam, Addendum.  However, the Board finds the July 2023 positive opinion connecting the Veteran right lower extremities radiculopathy to his right elbow arthritis strain to be inadequate as not supported by a sufficient rationale.  Moreover, the November 2023 VA-contracted examiner's medical negative opinions did not address the Veteran's contention that his right and left elbow disabilities onset during active service as a result of the physical requirements of his duties. Consequently, the failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand is warranted.  

The Board is also cognizant that 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 outlines the requirements for presumptive service connection of certain disabilities and disorders occurring in Persian Gulf Veterans, including undiagnosed illnesses and medically unexplained chronic multi-symptoms which manifest with signs or symptoms, specifically including joint pain and headaches, which became manifest either during active service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, or to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than December 31, 2026. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a), (b). In addition, the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022, Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (PACT Act) established for covered veterans a presumption of exposure to the substances, chemicals, and airborne hazards identified by the Secretary during a period of qualifying service unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the covered veteran was not exposed to any such toxics. 

The evidence of records includes the Veteran's DD 214 which reflects service in Southwest Asia from February 1998 through May 1998, however, the locations of the Veteran's service are not specified in the claims file. As the instant matter includes claims for the above disabilities that could be presumptively service connected, to include as medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illnesses (MUCMI), pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, additional clarification as to the locations of the Veteran's deployments are needed. Accordingly, remand is required to allow VA to obtain the necessary records to clarify the Veteran's deployment locations. 38 U.S.C. §5103A (c)(1)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(3).

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Attempt to obtain the complete service department records of the Veteran, to include the records pertaining to the Veteran's Army National Guard service from September 1999 through April 2002.  Attempt to clearly identify any periods of ACDUTRA and INACDUTRA during the Veteran's Army Reserve service through April 2005. Document all attempts to verify this service in the claims file. 

Provide notification as required by 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 if any such records are unavailable and inform the Veteran to afford the Veteran an opportunity to submit any copies in her possession.

2. Attempt to clarify the locations of the Veteran's deployments during active service, specifically to include from February 1998 to May 1998. Specifically, the AOJ should attempt to discern if the Veteran qualifies as a "Persian Gulf veteran" due to service in a location contemplated by 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.

3. Thereafter, forward the record and a copy of this Remand to the VA examiner who provided the November 2023 medical opinion, or, if that examiner is unavailable, to another equally qualified clinician, for completion of an addendum medical opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's syphilis and any residuals. If the clinician determines that a new examination is necessary to provide the requested opinion, such examination should be scheduled. The clinician should address the following:

Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that such disability had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.  

In rendering this opinion, the clinician should specifically address the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset of symptoms in service with continuation of symptoms including rash since such time, as well as the testing which was interpreted as revealing "old adequately treated syphilis" in January 2020. VA Treatment records received March 29, 2023, DOS January 7, 2020.

4. Forward the record and a copy of this Remand to the VA examiner who provided the November 2023 medical opinion, or, if that examiner is unavailable, to another equally qualified clinician, for completion of an addendum medical opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right and left elbow disabilities, claimed as joints pains, including right elbow strain. If the clinician determines that a new examination is necessary to provide the requested opinion, such examination should be scheduled. The clinician should address the following:

(a.) Please?identify?any current right or left elbow disability since the date of the Veteran's claim by either (1) diagnosis or (2) functional impairment.? 

(b.) As to any right or left elbow disability diagnosed above, whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that such disability had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.  

(c.) As to any right or left elbow disability diagnosed above, provide an opinion as to whether the etiology of the Veteran's right or left elbow disability is: (1) inconclusive, (2) partially understood, or (3) fully understood? Explain.

This determination must be based on the Veteran's specific case and cannot be based on the etiology of the disease or disability population as a whole.

(d.) As to any right or left elbow disability diagnosed above, provide an opinion as to whether the pathophysiology of the Veteran's right or left elbow disability is: (1) inconclusive, (2) partially understood, or (3) fully understood? Explain.

This determination must be based on the Veteran's 

specific case and cannot be based on the 

pathophysiology of the disease or disability population 

as a whole.

(e.) If both the etiology and pathophysiology are partially understood or fully understood, then opine whether is it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's diagnosed right and left elbow disability is due to or the result of his toxic exposure risk activities (TERA), to include the Veteran's deployment to the Southwest Asia theater from February 1998 through May 1998. Explain. 

When providing this opinion, the examiner must consider:

1) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and 2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

5. Forward the record and a copy of this Remand to the VA examiner who provided the November 2023 medical opinion, or if that examiner is unavailable, to another equally qualified clinician, for completion of an addendum medical opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's headache disability.  The clinician should address the following:

(a.) Please?identify?any current headache disability since the date of the Veteran's claim by either (1) diagnosis or (2) functional impairment.? 

(b.) As to any headache disability diagnosed above, whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that such disability had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.  

(c.) As to any headache disability diagnosed above, provide an opinion as to whether the etiology of the Veteran's headache disability is: (1) inconclusive, (2) partially understood, or (3) fully understood? Explain.

This determination must be based on the Veteran's specific case and cannot be based on the etiology of the disease or disability population as a whole.

(d.) As to any headache disability diagnosed above, provide an opinion as to whether the pathophysiology of the Veteran's headache disability: (1) inconclusive, (2) partially understood, or (3) fully understood? Explain.

This determination must be based on the Veteran's specific case and cannot be based on the pathophysiology of the disease or disability population as a whole.

(e.) If both the etiology and pathophysiology are partially understood or fully understood, then opine whether is it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's diagnosed headache disability is due to the TERA, to include the Veteran's deployment to the Southwest Asia theater from February 1998 through May 1998. Explain.

When providing this opinion, the examiner must consider: 1) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and 2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.
