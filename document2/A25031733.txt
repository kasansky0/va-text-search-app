REMANDED

Readjudication of the claim of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is remanded.

Entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) under?38 U.S.C. §?1318?is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1971 to June 1982.  He died in July 2018.  Prior to his death, the Veteran was service connected for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss.  His Death Certificate indicates only one cause of death: cardiomyopathy.  The appellant is his surviving spouse.  

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). Pub. L. No. 115-55, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017) (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.).  This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review on or after February 19, 2019.  As this case is an appeal of an August 2019 rating decision, this decision has been written consistent with the AMA framework.

In the March 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the appellant elected the Evidence Submission docket.? Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2019 decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant or her representative within 90 days of the filing of the March 2020 VA Form 10182.

In this regard, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of its decision on the issue(s) on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant or his or her representative with the NOD (VA Form 10182) or within 90 days following receipt of the NOD.? 38?C.F.R. §§?20.300(a), 303.

If additional evidence was submitted between the dates of the AOJ decision and VA's receipt of the NOD, the Board will not consider it unless it is resubmitted during the 90 days following VA's receipt of the NOD.? If evidence is not resubmitted, the appellant is still able to file a supplemental claim to have this evidence considered. ?Id.; Cook v. McDonough, No. 20-6853, 2023 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 808 (Vet. App. May 17, 2023).?The Board notes that the?appellant's representative, the National Association of County Veterans Service Officers (NACVSO) has waived their submission of Informal Hearing Presentations (IHPs), as such, the Board is free to proceed with adjudication of the claims herein.

The Board denied the Veterans claims for cause of death and DIC in a September 2023 Board decision.  However, the appellant appealed the claims in a January 2025 JMR.  In the January 2025 JMR, the parties agreed that the Board erred in its September 2023 decision because it did not provide adequate reasons and bases and also evidence was submitted in August 2019 in disc format, and it is not clear that the medical records on the discs were uploaded and scanned into the Veteran's claims folder.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board must remand this matter to correct predecisional duty to assist errors.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain and associate with the Veteran's claims file all treatment records, and ensure that all such are scanned into and uploaded into the Veteran's claims file. This includes, but is not limited to, records pertaining to the August 2019 discs relating to the Veteran's neuro medical records on a disc submitted in August 2019, and report from an August 2019 MRI of the brain.

The Board reminds the AOJ that the Board does not have access to the discs associated with the physical claims folder, so any documentation referenced as such must be printed and uploaded/added to the Veteran's VBMS or Virtual VA file.  If such documentation cannot be obtained and associated with the claims-file for review, documentation to this effect must be clearly noted in the Veteran's claims file and the Veteran must be duly notified.
