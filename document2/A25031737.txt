ORDER

The issue of an increased initial rating above 60 percent for dermatitis is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

During the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's dermatitis was manifested by constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.

During the entire period on appeal, the Veteran is in receipt of the highest schedular disability rating available under Diagnostic Code 7806, and his dermatitis is not manifested by any disfigurement or scarring of the head, face, or neck.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

For the entire period on appeal, the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 60 percent for dermatitis are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1-4.3, 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7806.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from December 1971 to May 1972.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The October 2024 rating decision was issued in response to an October 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, seeking review of a July 2023 rating decision. In its February 2024 Higher-Level Review decision, the AOJ identified a duty to assist error in the July 2023 decision and returned the case for further review. The AOJ then issued the October 2024 rating decision on appeal.

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record that the AOJ was permitted to consider at the time it issued the October 2024 rating decision on appeal (i.e., the evidence of record at the time it issued the July 2023 rating decision). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Finally, the Board notes that it is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, No. 21-7363 (U.S. Vet. App. June 21, 2024). The Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). At the time the Board received the Veteran's appeal, the one-year period following the October 2024 rating decision had not passed. 

However, the Williams Court did not address the issue of whether an appeal being advanced on the Board's docket, as here, affects the operation of section 20.202(c).  In this case, the Veteran's appeal has been advanced on the docket due to his age.  To have him wait longer for a decision would contravene the principle and purpose of advancing a case on the docket, which is to expedite appellate review of a claim due to circumstances which warrant earlier consideration and determination of the case, such as the appellant being seriously ill or under severe financial hardship.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b).  The advanced age of an appellant, which VA regulation defines as 75 or more years of age, is also sufficient cause for advancing a case on the docket.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(1).  Accordingly, in this case, the Board finds that notwithstanding the Court's holding in Williams, it may issue a decision in the Veteran's appeal before the time allotted for modifying the NOD under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c) has elapsed, as the appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period when new evidence was not allowed. To the extent the Board is granting the claim herein, it may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a Veteran's present symptoms with criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on average impairment in earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. In general, it is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

 "Staged" ratings are appropriate for an increased-rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods when the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms warranting different ratings irrespective of whether an initial or established rating. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). The effective date of an award of increased compensation should not be assigned mechanically based on the date of an examination. Rather, all of the facts should be examined to determine the earliest date that it is ascertainable that an increase in disability first manifested. Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015). Further, where an increase in the rating assigned is at issue, if factually ascertainable, the effective date assigned may be up to one year prior to the date the application for increase was received. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982-83 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Effective August 13, 2018, under DC 7806, a 10 percent rating is warranted if there is one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period. A 30 percent rating is warranted if there is one of the following: characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body affected or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period. A maximum 60 percent rating is warranted if there is at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body affected or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7806.

Systemic therapy means "treatment pertaining to or affecting the body as a whole," whereas topical therapy means "treatment pertaining to a particular surface area, as a topical anti-infective applied to a certain area of the skin and affecting only the area to which it is applied." See Johnson v. Shulkin, 862 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2017). 

The issue of an increased initial rating above 60 percent for dermatitis

The Veteran seeks a higher initial disability rating for his service-connected dermatitis, which is currently rated at 60 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 7806.

In March 1972, service treatment records reflect that the Veteran was hospitalized for a rash.

In July 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA skin diseases examination. The examiner noted his diagnosis of unspecified dermatitis in 1972. The examiner noted that the Veteran presented lesions in the front and back area of the trunk and inguinal area which produces burning and is worse with solar exposure. The examiner further noted that the skin lesions cause itching, difficulty sleeping, difficult concentration, and frustrate the Veteran and cause him shame. The examiner also documented a previous skin condition that has now resolved of cutaneous abscess of the limb. The Veteran reported use of an antibiotic constantly or near-constantly. Visible characteristic lesions were estimated to cover approximately five to 20 percent of his body. The examiner noted that the Veteran's skin condition did not cause scarring or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck.

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a lay statement which was translated in August 2024. He stated that his skin continues to increase in burning sensation and other discomfort on the right side of his shoulder. He described the skin condition as red blisters, some of which change to black in the maturation process, and have never disappeared from his body.

Based on the above, the Board finds that a maximum rating of 60 percent under DC 7806 is warranted during the entire period on appeal.

The weight of the evidence of record during the appeal period is sufficient to meet the criteria for the highest rating under DC 7806. Specifically, the relevant medical evidence of record, to include the VA examination, shows that the severity of the Veteran's dermatitis manifested by constant or near-constant systemic therapy required over the past 12-month period, which is commensurate of a 60 percent rating under the DC 7806 amended criteria. Therefore, the highest rating under DC 7806 is appropriate.

The Board notes that the assignment of a 60 percent rating is the maximum schedular rating under DC 7806, and a higher rating under that DC is not allowed.

The Board has also considered whether separate ratings are warranted under other potentially pertinent diagnostic codes. A review of the file reflects that the Veteran's dermatitis does not involve a burn scar or disfigurement with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of three or more features of the head, face, or neck; therefore, a higher rating under DCs 7800 through 7805 is not warranted.
