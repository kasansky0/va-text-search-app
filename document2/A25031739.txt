REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a lower back disability is remanded. 

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee strain is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran honorably served in the United States Army from October 1989 to October 1993 and from January 1995 to September 1999.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Higher Level Review (HLR) rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

Historically, the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for lower back and left knee disabilities were denied in a September 2023 rating decision. The Veteran filed a September 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Request for HLR, seeking review of the AOJ's denials. In the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted the Veteran's left knee claim and assigned a 10 percent rating and continued its previous denial of the lower back service connection claim based upon the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 decision. 

In his March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claims currently on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of same. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for a lower back disability is remanded. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for a lower back disability and contends that it arises from his active-duty service. See January 2023 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim. However, remand is necessary in this case to ensure that due process is followed and that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claim so that he is afforded every possible consideration. 38?U.S.C. §?5103; 38?C.F.R. §?3.159. Here, the basis for remand concerns a pre-decisional error arising from VA's duty to assist. 38?C.F.R. §?20.802.

Careful review of his January 2023 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, reveals his reports of what could be considered functional impairment. Further analysis of his claims file shows that he was not afforded a VA examination and medical opinion prior to the issuance of the February 2024 rating decision. 

Affording the Veteran a VA examination and medical opinion has a reasonable possibility of substantiating his claim for benefits, particularly as to the presence of a current disability and the causal relationship between his low back disability and his active-duty service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997). In consideration of the Veteran's assertions of functional impairment and the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims' (Court) holding in Saunders, the Board finds that the AOJ's failure to afford the Veteran a VA examination and medical opinion before denying the claim in the February 2024 rating decision on appeal is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2018); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-85 (2006).

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee strain is remanded.

The Veteran seeks an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for his service-connected left knee strain and contends that it is more severe than rated. See January 2023 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim. The Veteran has explicitly stated that he takes several medications to treat his left knee disability. See id.; October 2020 Knee and Lower Leg Condition Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). 

In Jones v. Shinseki, the Court held that "the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria." 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). More specifically, "if [a DC] does not specifically contemplate the effects of medication, the Board is required... to discount the ameliorative effects of medication." McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) (en banc) (citing Jones, 26 Vet. App. at 63). Additionally, the Court has recently stated that when the Board adjudicates an increased rating claim for a musculoskeletal disability under a diagnostic code which does not contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication, it must consider the beneficial effects of the medication on the severity of the Veterans disability, including an evaluation of the baseline of the veteran's disability and whether it may be more severe than rated without medication. Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, at *18, 19. Prior to the Court's March 2025 decision in Ingram, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his left knee disability in October 2020. See October 2020 Knee and Lower Leg Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). Although the Veteran reported taking medications to treat his left knee disability, the ameliorative effects of same on the severity his left knee disability were not considered or discussed by the October 2020 examiner. There are no other VA examinations which consider same within the applicable evidentiary window. 

The Board cannot make, on its own, a medical determination as to the ameliorative effects that the Veteran's medications may have on his left knee disability. See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991) (stating that the Board cannot make its own, independent medical judgments). Accordingly, the findings of the October 2020 VA examiner require clarification. Affording the Veteran a VA medical opinion which expounds upon the findings of the October 2020 VA examiner has a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim, particularly as to the severity of his left knee disability without the ameliorative effects of medication. Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, at *18, 19. The Board therefore finds that the evidence of record was inadequate at the time of the February 2024 rating decision, requiring remand. See 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a). 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Forward the Veteran's claims file for a VA examination and medical opinion regarding the Veteran's lower back condition. The entire claims file must be made available to, and be reviewed by, the VA examiner. All appropriate tests, studies, and consultations should be accomplished, and all clinical findings should be reported in detail.

The medical professional should provide an opinion to the following:

(a.) Identify and diagnose all lower back disabilities.

(b.) For each diagnosis in (a.), whether it was incurred in or is otherwise related to the Veteran's active-duty service?

Although an independent review of the claims file is required, the Board calls the medical professional's attention to: (i) the Veteran's STRs, including his reports of recurrent back pain on his June 1999 Report of Medical History (see May 2007 STRs); and (ii) the history and symptoms of the Veteran's disabilities as provided by the Veteran. See January 2023 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim. 

The examiner is reminded that a medical opinion is adequate if it is based upon consideration of the Veteran's prior medical history and describes the Veteran's condition in sufficient detail so as to allow the Board to make a fully informed evaluation. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?120, 124 (2007); see also Ardison v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?405, 407 (1994). This requires the opinion to "contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two." Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295, 301 (2008).

The examiner is cautioned that the absence of documented treatment in service or thereafter is not fatal to a service connection claim, and the absence of evidence in the service treatment records is an insufficient basis, by itself, for a negative opinion. See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). The Board also notes that the absence of documented treatment, in and of itself, is not a basis for discrediting the Veteran's lay statements of continuity. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In this regard, the relevant inquiry is whether there was continuity of symptomatology, not continuity of treatment. See Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991).

The examiner is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions rendered. If the examiner is unable to offer the requested opinion, it is essential that the examiner offer a rationale for the conclusion that an opinion cannot be provided without resort to speculation, together with a statement as to whether there is additional evidence that might enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge. See Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 390 (2010).

2. Forward the Veteran's claims file for an addendum opinion regarding the Veteran's left knee disability. The need for a physical examination is left to the discretion of the medical professional offering the addendum opinion. The entire claims file must be made available to, and be reviewed by, the VA examiner. All appropriate tests, studies, and consultations should be accomplished, and all clinical findings should be reported in detail.

The medical professional should provide an opinion to the following:

(a.) Consider and discuss if the Veteran's left knee disability would be more severe if it is untreated by medication. Please explain why or why not. 

(b.) Consider and discuss what the baseline of the Veteran's left knee disability would be when the beneficial effects of medication are discounted, i.e., what is the severity of his disability without medication?

The examiner should provide range of motion estimations for flexion and extension movements based on a review of all procurable information - to include the Veteran's statement on examination, case-specific evidence (to include medical treatment records when applicable and lay evidence), and the examiner's medical expertise. 

Additionally, the examiner should address the Veteran's lay statements that he utilizes medication to treat his left knee disability. See January 2023 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim; October 2020 Knee and Lower Leg Condition DBQ.
