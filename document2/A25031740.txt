DOCKET NO. 240417-433365
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

2. Entitlement to service connection for migraines is dismissed. 

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. As the September 2024 rating decision granted all benefits sought on appeal, resolving the claim for entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus in full, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. 

2. As the September 2024 rating decision granted all benefits sought on appeal, resolving the claim for entitlement to service connection for migraines in full, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the claim for service connection for bilateral pes planus have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

2. The criteria for dismissal of the claim for service connection for migraines have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 2007 to July 2007, from April 2008 to April 2009, and from June 2009 to July 2009, with additional service as a United States Army Reservist. Notably, the Veteran earned the Iraq Campaign Medal for service in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for hypertension, any evidence the Board could not consider, including documentation of Veteran status, will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

[The Board notes the April 2024 Notice of Disagreement included service connection claims for right and left carpal tunnel syndrome which were denied in a February 2024 rating decision. The Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim in February 2024 for these claims, and a rating decision had not yet been completed by the AOJ prior to the April 2024 Notice of Disagreement. The Veteran was notified by the Board in a May 2024 letter that the service connection claims for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome were not eligible for Board review because of the pending Supplemental Claim. Accordingly, the claims for service connection of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome are not part of this appeal and will not be adjudicated in this decision.]   

1. Service connection for bilateral pes planus (claimed as bilateral flatfoot).

2. Service connection for migraines.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. In the April 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran requested that the Board review the AOJ's denial of entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus and migraines in the November 2023 rating decision. Thereafter, in a September 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for bilateral pes planus and migraines. 

When an appealed claim is granted in full during the pendency of the appeal, no case or controversy remains. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Holland v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 433 (1997).

As the September 2024 rating decision granted the benefit sought on appeal, resolving these claims in full, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration; accordingly, the claims for service connection for bilateral pes planus and migraines are dismissed as moot.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service connection for hypertension.

The Board's jurisdiction to remand is limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying regulatory statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim.

The Veteran asserts she was diagnosed with hypertension (high blood pressure) during her military career. See March 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show she received a hypertension work-up, an initial diagnosis of hypertension, and an initial medication prescription for hypertension in an April 2012 service treatment note. The Veteran's military personnel record shows service as a reservist in April 2012. See March 2023 VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR) Report.  

Despite this evidence, the AOJ failed to obtain the necessary records to determine the Veteran's status at the time of the hypertension work-up and initial diagnosis. Whether the Veteran was on an active duty for training (ACDUTRA) status or an inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA) status is germane to the hypertension service connection claim. 

The Board finds there is a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and, accordingly, a remand is warranted for clarification of the Veteran's status at the time of the initial hypertension work-up and diagnosis. 

While the Board is remanding this matter at this time, it is mindful of the holding in Smith v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 332 (2020), and the impact of implicit credibility determinations within remand orders. The Board does not at this time make any determinations regarding the credibility of any evidence currently of record with regard to the Veteran's claim, to include those described in this remand. The Board also notes that a remand is not a final Board decision. See Clark v. McDonough, 25 Vet. App. 217 (2022) (final Board decision is one where benefits are granted or denied (not remanded) and the claimant is adversely affected by the decision). 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain relevant records to determine the Veteran's status at the time of the April 2012 hypertension work-up and initial diagnosis. Relevant records include, but are not limited to, leave and earning statements and military orders. Associate any documents with the claims file.

2. Upon completion of the direction above, readjudicate the claim for service connection of hypertension.
