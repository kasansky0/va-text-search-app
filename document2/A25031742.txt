REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service in the United States Air Force from January 1978 to April 1988. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the August 11, 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 10, 2023 notification of the April 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR in August 2023. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the April 2023 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. Because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

In September 2023, the Veteran's representative, Disabled American Veterans, submitted an informal hearing presentation. 

1. Entitlement to a TDIU

The Veteran filed a claim for a TDIU in December 2022, contending that he is entitled to a TDIU based on his service-connected right and left knee disabilities.

VA will grant a TDIU when the evidence shows that a veteran is precluded, by reason of his service-connected disabilities, from securing and following "substantially gainful employment" consistent with his education and occupational experience. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. The regulations provide that if there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more, and if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability must bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Currently, the Veteran does not meet the schedular criteria for entitlement to TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). He is service connected and rated, in pertinent part, as follows: right total knee replacement with strain, anterior cruciate tear, Baker's cyst, and degenerative arthritis (DC 5055) 30 percent from August 1, 2010, 100 percent from September 13, 2022, 100 percent from November 1, 2022, 30 percent from March 1, 2023; left knee meniscal tear with knee anterior cruciate ligament tear, degenerative arthritis, and Baker's Cyst (limitation of flexion) (DC 5003-5260) 10 percent from October 31, 2019, 100 percent from December 17, 2019, 10 percent from February 1, 2020, and 10 percent from December 20, 2022; right shoulder disability (5203-5019) 10 percent from February 9, 2004; bilateral hearing loss (DC 6100) 10 percent from September 20, 2011; and tinnitus (DC 6260) 10 percent from September 20, 2011. He Veteran does not have a single disability rated 40 percent or 60 percent, to include consideration of the exceptions in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a)(1)-(5), or a combined rating of 70 percent. Therefore, he does not meet the schedular criteria for TDIU.

However, even where a veteran does not meet the schedular criteria of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), VA must consider whether TDIU is warranted on an extraschedular basis under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). The Board cannot consider entitlement to TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) in the first instance, but, if such consideration is warranted, must first remand the claim for referral to VA's Director of Compensation Service ("Director"). Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 10 (2001). 

Referral for extraschedular consideration is warranted if there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a veteran is unemployable because of service-connected disability. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019). The threshold for referral for extraschedular consideration is lower than the standard for granting or denying TDIU. Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1, 9 (2021).

In May 2020, the Social Security Administration (SSA) determined that the Veteran was disabled from December 16, 2019 due to osteoarthrosis and allied disorders. SSA documents indicated that the left knee had improved after surgery but the right knee total knee replacement from 2009 was unstable. SSA found that the Veteran was no longer able to perform past relevant work of medium exertion due to his functional limitations and that consideration of sedentary work was appropriate. SSA found that the Veteran's past work was semi-skilled and that 12th grade was the highest grade of school completed by the Veteran. SSA determined that transferability of skills was not at issue because the Veteran's past relevant work was medium exertion and he was now only capable of sedentary work. 

In his December 2022 VA Form 21-8940 Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation based on Unemployability, the Veteran indicated that his right and left knee disabilities prevent him from securing or following any substantial gainful occupation. He indicated that he became too disabled to work on December 17, 2019 and that he last worked full-time on July 19, 2014. From January 29, 2018, to December 16, 2019, he made deliveries, drove a forklift, and took care of supplies for a floor maintenance and supply company. In remarks, he stated that he had a left knee scope on December 17, 2019 and that he was under doctor's care until about February 12, 2020. He stated that he was granted Social Security Administration (SSA) disability benefits in June 2020. He had worked as a courtesy car driver for an auto center from October 15, 2021, to December 27, 2021, working 25 hours per week. He reported that since his two-month employment in 2021, he had had another right knee replacement, his first having been in 2009. He asserted that he did not leave his last job because of his disability but that he was on SSDI because of his knees and that the potential of getting better and having gainful employment in the future was nonexistent.

Together with his December 2022 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran submitted a January 2020 letter from a private physician who stated that he had discussed with the Veteran his job duties and whether he had considered retirement. The physician stated that the Veteran indicated that he was ready to retire and decrease stress on his prosthesis. 

During a January 2023 VA knee and lower leg examination the Veteran reported that he retired in July 2014 from his occupation as a mailman. The Veteran reported difficulty walking around indoor track at YMCA twice due to right knee pain (7 laps around track is one mile). He reported going up and down stairs was painful due to right knee pain and reported difficulty using stationary bike due to pain with repetitive use of left knee. He also reported he had not been able to work due to right knee pain. The examiner stated that the Veteran's right and left knee conditions affected the Veteran's quality of life and ADLs. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unemployable during the period on review. Together, this evidence is enough to satisfy the low threshold.

Under the AMA, the Board may remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The failure to refer this matter to the Director for consideration of an extraschedular rating for TDIU is an error in satisfying a regulatory duty under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). Remand is therefore warranted. 

In reaching this determination, the Board does not make any findings, explicit or implicit, as to whether TDIU is ultimately warranted, as the standard for granting TDIU is a higher standard than the "reasonable possibility" standard for an initial referral for extraschedular consideration. See Snider, 35 Vet. App. at 9; Ray, 31 Vet. App. at 62 (holding that the Board is not bound to grant an extraschedular benefit even if the Board itself previously determined that referral to the Director of Compensation Service was appropriate).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Refer the issue of entitlement to TDIU to VA's Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular consideration pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).
