FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's right knee degenerative arthritis is manifest by extension limited to 20 degrees.

2. The Veteran's right knee degenerative arthritis with limited flexion is increased to 30 percent disabling, based on flexion limited to 15 degrees during flare-ups, which is the maximum schedular rating permitted for limitation of flexion of the leg.

3. The Veteran's left knee degenerative arthritis with limited flexion is increased to 30 percent disabling, based on flexion limited to 15 degrees, which is the maximum schedular rating permitted for limitation of flexion of the leg.

4. The Veteran's right knee instability requires a prescription of both a brace and a cane which warrants a 30 percent rating, which is the maximum schedular rating permitted for this diagnostic code. 

5. The Veteran's left knee instability requires a prescription of both a brace and a cane which warrants a 30 percent rating, which is the maximum schedular rating permitted for this diagnostic code.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1989 to June 1990. 

In May 1990, the Veteran suffered a right knee injury in service following a fall from the second floor of a barracks. In June 1990 and July 1990, the Veteran filed her initial claim for right knee injury and subsequent surgery. In November 1990, a Rating Decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) granted a 30 percent rating for the Veteran's right knee injury. In February 1991, the Veteran submitted a claim seeking a temporary 100 percent rating beginning January 1991 as the Veteran had undergone right knee surgery. In May 1991, the RO granted a temporary 100 percent rating from January 31, 1991, to March 31, 1991, with a 30 percent rating resuming on April 1, 1991. In June 1991, the Veteran filed for an extension of her 100 percent rating as she was still recuperating. An August 1991, RO rating decision extended the Veteran's temporary 100 percent rating through June 1991 with the 30 percent rating resuming July 1, 1991. In April 1993, the Veteran submitted her initial claim for a left knee condition while also seeking an increased rating for the right knee. An October 1993 RO rating decision continued the 30 percent rating for the Veteran's right knee and granted a staged rating for the left knee with a 0 percent rating effective January 31, 1991, and a 10 percent rating effective April 20, 1993. The Veteran did not appeal this ruling and no new and material evidence was received within one year and so this decision became final. 

In April 2000, the Veteran filed a new claim to reopen her bilateral knee claims indicating that her condition had worsened. In June 2000, the RO continued the 30 percent right knee rating and the 10 percent left knee rating finding that any worsening did not justify an increased rating. The Veteran did not appeal this ruling and no new and material evidence was received within one year and so this decision became final. 

In December 2006, the Veteran filed to re-open her bilateral knee claims and indicated she wanted to be re-evaluated. A January 2008 RO rating decision provided multiple ratings for the knees. This decision split the right knee rating into three separate ratings including a 10 percent rating for right knee instability effective January 19, 2007, a 40 percent rating for right knee limited extension effective January 19, 2007, and a 0 percent rating for right knee limited flexion effective January 19, 2007. It then split the left knee rating into two separate disabilities with 0 percent assigned for left knee instability effective January 19, 2007, and a 0 percent rating for left knee limited extension effective January 19. 2007. The Veteran did not appeal this ruling and no new and material evidence was received within one year and so this decision became final. 

In May 2016, the Veteran filed a new claim for an increased rating for her bilateral knees. An August 2016 RO rating decision denied any increased ratings for any knee disabilities. New VA examinations were completed in October 2018. These prompted an RO rating decision which proposed to decrease the Veteran's right knee limitation of extension from 40 percent to 10 percent, proposed to decrease the left knee limitation of extension from 20 percent to 10 percent, and proposed to reduce the Veteran's right knee instability from 10 percent to 0 percent. A September 2019, RO rating decision effectuated these reductions effective December 1, 2019. A September 2020, RO rating decision determined that clear and unmistakable error had occurred and the previous ratings for all three bilateral knee disabilities were restored. In September 2020, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim for the bilateral knees. A February 2021 RO rating decision granted an increased rating of 20 percent for the Veteran's right knee limitation of flexion effective January 13, 2021, increased right knee instability to 20 percent effective January 13, 2021, granted a separate rating for left knee instability with a 10 percent rating effective January 13, 2021, and granted a separate 0 percent rating for left knee limitation of extension effective January 13, 2021. This same rating decision continued the Veteran's left knee flexion rating at 10 percent and decreased the Veteran's right knee limitation of extension from 30 percent to 10 percent effective January 13, 2021. In September 2021, the Veteran requested Higher Level Review (HLR) of the September 2021 rating decision. A November 2021 HLR rating decision made no changes to the September 2021 rating decision findings. A March 2022, RO rating decision continued the ratings for the left and right knee instability. In November 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim seeking an increased rating for her bilateral knee disabilities. A March 2023 rating decision deferred a finding on these increased rating claims pending additional examinations. In May 2023, following completion of these examinations, the RO continued a 10 percent rating for right knee limitation of extension, continued a 20 percent rating for right knee limitation of flexion, continued a 10 percent rating for left knee limitation of flexion (noted as previously rated as limited extension), continued a 20 percent rating for right knee instability, and continued a 10 percent rating for left knee instability. It is this decision that is on appeal. In January 2024, the Veteran appealed that decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) via a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)). The Veteran requested the Direct Review docket.

As an appeal in which the appellant requested, on the Notice of Disagreement, direct review by the Board without submission of additional evidence and without a Board hearing, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the decision on the issues on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Evidence has been submitted during a window of time when the Board may not consider it in reaching this decision. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, additional medical records. If the Veteran wishes for this evidence to be considered, he may do so by filing a supplemental claim. Instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is evenly balanced, with a claimant prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Staged ratings are appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505(2007). The Veteran's disability is viewed in relation to its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589(1995).

Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

Entitlement to an increased rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for right knee degenerative arthritis with limited extension.

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a 10 percent rating for right knee limited extension. The Board finds that the available evidence supports an increased rating of 30 percent, and no higher, for right knee limitation of extension. 

The Veteran's right knee degenerative arthritis with limited extension is rated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 5261. Generally, knee disabilities are rated under DC 5256 through 5263. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. DC 5256 addresses ankylosis of the knee. DC 5257 addresses impairment due to recurrent subluxation or lateral instability. DC 5258 addresses dislocated semilunar cartilage in the knee manifested by frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint. DC 5259 addresses symptomatic residuals related to removal of semilunar cartilage. DC 5260 and 5261 address limitation of motion on flexion and extension. DC 5262 addresses impairment of the tibia and fibula from malunion or nonunion. DC 5263 addresses genu recurvatum. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. Under DC 5261, limitation of extension of the knee to 5 degrees warrants a noncompensable rating; limitation of extension of the knee to 10 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating; limitation of extension of the knee to 15 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating; limitation of extension of the knee to 20 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating; limitation of extension of the knee to 30 degrees warrants a 40 percent rating; and limitation of extension of the knee to 45 degrees warrants a 50 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261.

As noted above, the Veteran's bilateral knees injuries began in May 1990 when she fell off a ledge of a second-floor barracks building and fractured her knee. She underwent right knee ACL reconstruction surgery in January 1991. This surgery failed and a second ACL reconstruction was completed. As part of her right knee surgery, the left knee was also operated on to transplant ligaments from the left knee to the right knee in an attempt to increase stability. The Veteran has continuously complained of the bilateral knees worsening since exiting service. The Veteran's procedural history of her bilateral knees is long and complicated and discussed in full earlier in this Board decision. 

A March 2007 VA examination for the bilateral knees noted that the Veteran had been prescribed a left knee support in March 2004 by the Detroit VAMC. 

Following the September 2020 rating reduction, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim. As a result of this supplemental claim, a new VA examination was ordered. In January 2021, a VA examination focused on the Veteran's bilateral knees was completed. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with a right knee ACL tear (1990), bilateral knee instability, degenerative arthritis of the right knee, patellar tendon graft side at the left knee. The Veteran's symptoms included sharp shooting moderate-severe pain, numbness, arthritis pain, limited range of motion (ROM), and feeling like the knee was going to give out. The Veteran noted taking Ethodolac, Methocarbamol, and Motrin. The Veteran was indicated to have a limited range of motion and that when combined with the pain it made it difficult for her to walk up the stairs. She also noted that she suffered from many falls which made it difficult for her to carry groceries, sit for long periods of time, or stand for long periods of time. The Veteran complained of flare-ups of the right knee occurring daily. The Veteran described these as severe in nature and that they can last from 15 minutes to all day. These can be precipitated by standing too long, walking, or sitting. There was no indication of how to alleviate them. Similarly, left knee flare-ups occurred every day and were described as severe. She indicated that nothing makes the flare-ups better. ROM of the right knee was measured at flexion to 40 degrees and extension to 0 degrees. There was no change with observed repetitive use. Upon repeated use over time flexion was measured at 30 degrees and extension to 10 degrees. The examiner provided right knee ROM measurements for flare-ups as flexion to 30 degrees and extension to 5 degrees. For the left knee, initial ROM was measured at flexion to 40 degrees and extension to 0 degrees with no change upon observed repetitive use. Left knee ROM was measured at flexion to 40 degrees and extension to 0 degrees with repeated use over time. Left knee flare-up ROM was measured at flexion to 35 degrees and extension to 5 degrees. 

In December 2021, an additional VA examination was completed. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with a right knee meniscal tear (1989) as well as right knee tendinitis. The Veteran said she suffered from flare-ups that she described as severe and which last 2-3 days. These flare-ups were precipitated by sitting or standing for an extended period of time and were alleviated by elevation and rest. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy, ankylosis, or recurrent subluxation or persistent instability. The examiner also noted that there was no prescription for a cane, walker, crutches, or a brace. The Veteran complained of continued symptoms including right knee pain, locking, swelling, and giving way. The Veteran's left knee had continued pain and weakness. The examiner indicated no findings of joint instability for either knee. Right knee ROM was measured at flexion to 60 degrees and extension to 0 degrees. There was no change with observed repetitive use, repeated use over time, or flare-ups. Left knee ROM measurements were flexion to 90 degrees and extension to 0 degrees. There was no change with observed repetitive use or repetitive use over time or flare-ups. 

In November 2022, the Veteran submitted a Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with a right knee ACL tear, bilateral knee instability, right knee degenerative arthritis, and left knee patellar tendon graft site. The Veteran complained that her bilateral knee pain had gotten progressively worse with the right knee worse than the left. The Veteran underwent physical therapy following a 2021 arthroscopy. The Veteran complained of flare-ups with movement of the knees. She complained of difficulty going up and down stairs, performing sit to stand, being unable to stand for more than 15 minutes before requiring rest due to pain, unable to walk for more than 20 minutes, and being unable to squat to pick up an object on the ground. The Veteran reported a history of instability or recurrent subluxation and noted that her knee feels painful and gives out without support. The examiner found no evidence of muscle atrophy, ankylosis. The examiner noted a history of recurrent subluxation or persistent instability. The examiner also stated that the Veteran's right knee required a prescription for both a cane and a brace while the left knee required prescription for an appliance, but no specifics were provided. Right knee ROM measurements found flexion to 30 degrees and extension to 20 degrees with no change on observed repetitive use. There were no findings provided for repeated use over time or flare-ups and no explanation was provided. For the left knee, ROM measurements were flexion to 15 degrees and extension to 45 degrees with no change on observed repetitive use. There were no findings provided for repeated use over time or flare-ups and no explanation was provided.

In May 2023, a VA examination focused on the bilateral knees was completed. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with left knee instability, left knee patellar tendon graft donor site, mild lateral laxity, and degenerative right knee arthritis with limitation flexion and extension. The Veteran stated that her condition had worsened. She was being treated with over-the-counter Tylenol and cortisone injections the most recent of which was two weeks prior to examination. The Veteran described her pain as a constant 8/10 on the pain scale. The Veteran denied flare-ups. The examiner noted no history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the knee and no history of frequent effusion of the knee. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy or ankylosis. For the Veteran's right knee, the examiner noted that the Veteran had been prescribed a cane. For the Veteran's left knee, the Veteran had been prescribed a cane. 

Based upon the findings of the November 2022, DBQ the Veteran's right knee extension has been limited to 20 degrees. This finding is enough to justify an increase to a 30 percent rating. 

The next highest rating for the Veteran's limitation of extension would require a finding of extension limited to 30 degrees. The Board finds no such evidence in the record and so therefore a 30 percent rating, and no higher, is justified for the limitation of extension of the Veteran's right knee. Accordingly, the increased rating claim is granted to 30 percent. 

Entitlement to an increased rating of 30 percent for right knee degenerative arthritis with limited flexion.

The Veteran's right knee flexion is currently rated at 20 percent disabling. She is seeking an increased rating. A 30 percent rating is the highest rating allowable under DC 5260. 

Diagnostic Code 5260 provides for a non-compensable rating where flexion is limited to 60 degrees; a 10 percent rating where flexion is limited to 45 degrees; a 20 percent rating is warranted where flexion is limited to 30 degrees; and a 30 percent rating is warranted where flexion is limited to 15 degrees. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260.

The Veteran's history of VA examinations and their ROM findings is discussed earlier in this opinion and will not be completely recounted here. However, the Board will focus on the November 2022 DBQ. For the right knee ROM, the examiner provided a finding of flexion to 30 degrees. At this same examination, the Veteran complained of flare-ups of the knee but when completing the ROM testing, there were no findings for repeated use over time or flare-ups. While the Board cannot substitute its own medical judgment in place of the examiner, the Board does not find it to be an unrealistic supposition that upon repeated use over time and during a flare-up that the Veteran would lose 15 degrees of ROM. Especially when considered with the fact that in January 2021, the Veteran described her flare-ups of the right knee as severe and stated that they could not be alleviated and that they could last all day. The failure of the examiner to provide these measurements should not result in the Veteran losing out on a potential rating. As the Veteran is already rated at 100 percent, the Board finds that there is no sense in delaying these proceedings further to obtain what may be negative evidence. Instead, the Board will provide all benefit of the doubt to the Veteran and determine that during a flare-up or after repeated use over time the Veteran's flexion ROM would be reduced to 15 degrees. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021) (en banc). Therefore, a 30 percent rating is warranted.  

Entitlement to an increased rating of 30 percent for left knee limitation of flexion.

The Veteran's left knee limitation of flexion is currently rated at 10 percent under DC 5260. She is seeking an increased rating. The Board finds that's a 30 percent rating, the highest rating allowable under this DC is warranted. 

Diagnostic Code 5260 provides for a non-compensable rating where flexion is limited to 60 degrees; a 10 percent rating where flexion is limited to 45 degrees; a 20 percent rating is warranted where flexion is limited to 30 degrees; and a 30 percent rating is warranted where flexion is limited to 15 degrees. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260.

The Veteran's VA examinations and DBQ findings are relayed elsewhere in this opinion and will not be repeated. Instead, the Board will focus on the findings of the November 2022 DBQ. When taking ROM measurement of the left knee, flexion was measured to 15 degrees. A 15-degree limitation warrants a 30 percent rating which is the highest rating possible under this DC. As the Veteran's left knee flexion is limited to 15 degrees, a 30 percent rating is warranted, and the increased rating claim is granted. 

Entitlement to an increased rating of 30 percent for right knee instability.

The Veteran's right knee instability is currently rated at 20 percent. She is seeking an increased rating under DC 5257. 

Under DC 5257 a 30 percent disability rating is assigned to impairment of the knee manifest as recurrent subluxation or instability with unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation. Id. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted with a knee impairment manifest as one of the following: (a) sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation; or, (b) unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. Id. A 10 percent disability rating is warranted for a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. Id.

A 30 percent disability rating is assigned to impairment of the knee manifest as patellar instability involving a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257 (2021). A 20 percent disability rating is assigned to a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: a brace, cane, or walker. Id. A 10 percent disability rating is assigned to a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker. Id.

For patellar instability, the patellofemoral complex consists of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257 Note (1).

The Veteran has suffered from various conditions of the patella including an ACL tear, a meniscal condition, and degenerative arthritis as discussed in the prior sections of this opinion. The Board notes that at the December 2021 VA examination the examiner noted there was no prescription for any assistive devices including a cane, walker, crutches, or a brace. However, this was in direct contrast to the November 2022 DBQ, which found the Veteran had been prescribed both a cane and a brace for her right knee. Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence for and against the claim is in approximate balance. Accordingly, the benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, and entitlement to a 30 percent rating for right knee instability is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021) (en banc).

Entitlement to an increased rating of 30 percent for left knee instability.

The Veteran's left knee instability is currently rated at 10 percent. She is seeking an increased rating under DC 5257. 

A 30 percent disability rating is assigned to impairment of the knee manifest as recurrent subluxation or instability with unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation. Id. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted with a knee impairment manifest as one of the following: (a) sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation; or, (b) unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. Id. A 10 percent disability rating is warranted for a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. Id.

A 30 percent disability rating is assigned to impairment of the knee manifest as patellar instability involving a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257 (2021). A 20 percent disability rating is assigned to a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: a brace, cane, or walker. Id. A 10 percent disability rating is assigned to a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker. Id.

For patellar instability, the patellofemoral complex consists of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257 Note (1).

The Veteran has suffered from various conditions of the patella including an ACL tear with repair resulting in a left knee graft and degenerative arthritis as discussed in the prior sections of this opinion. The March 2007 VA examination noted that the Veteran was wearing a Thermoskin knee support on her left knee that had been prescribed by the orthopedic department of the Detroit VAMC in March 2004. Then, the May 2023, VA examination stated that the Veteran had been prescribed a cane for her left knee. Therefore, there is a finding of prescriptions for both a left knee brace and a cane as a result of the Veteran's instability. This justifies a 30 percent rating and therefore, the increased rating claim is granted.
