REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a back disability, to include back pain, is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from July 2007 to July 2012. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of January 2024 and April 2024 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

The Veteran timely submitted his VA Form 10182 in August 2024, and now appeals the January 2024 and April 2024 rating decisions.  The Board clarifies that while the Veteran identified the January 2023 rating decision as the decision on appeal for his back disability, a decision regarding his back disability was identified within one year of his submission of his VA Form 10182, which was the April 2024 decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  See August 2024 VA Form 10182.

First, regarding the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Next, regarding the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for a back disability, the Veteran's claim was first denied in January 2023.  The Veteran requested higher level review (HLR) of that decision in November 2023.  Following HLR, the AOJ again denied the Veteran's claim in April 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for a back disability and entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability, to include back pain, is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that his back disability is due to heavy lifting in service.  See August 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.  He also asserts that he was never afforded a VA examination for his back disability.  See August 2024 VA Form 10182.  Further, the Veteran contends that his tinnitus was caused by working on the flight deck while in service.  See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Here, the Board finds that remand is necessary to correct multiple pre-decisional duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the rating decisions on appeal.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), remands are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  In the present appeal, three pre-decisional duty to assist errors occurred; specifically, at the time of the rating decision on appeal, (1) the Veteran's VA treatment records were not associated with his claims file nor were adequate attempts made to retrieve them; (2) the Veteran's reserve service records were not associated with his claims file nor were adequate attempts made to retrieve them; and (3) the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination for his back disability despite showing good cause for cancelling his original appointment and expressing a willingness to attend an examination.

VA Treatment Records and Reserve Records (Back Disability and Tinnitus)

First, VA is required to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate his claim for benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  The Federal Circuit has held that VA's duty to assist includes the duty to obtain VA treatment records, regardless of the relevancy of those records.  See Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786, 790-91 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

VA must make all reasonable attempts to obtain federal records.  If any records cannot be obtained after reasonable efforts have been made, VA must issue a formal determination that such records do not exist or that further efforts to obtain such records would be futile, which should be documented in the Veteran's claims file.  The Veteran must be notified of the attempts made and why further attempts would be futile, and allowed the opportunity to provide such records, as provided in 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e).

Here, attempts were made to locate the Veteran's VA treatment records; however, another Veteran's VA treatment records were associated with the Veteran's claims file.  While those documents have now been removed from the Veteran's claims file, the Veteran's actual VA treatment records have not yet been associated with his file.  See August 2022 and September 2023 Search Results.  VA record search results show that there are VA treatment records associated with the Veteran.  Id.

Additionally, the Veteran appears to have served in the Navy Reserves between July 2012 and February 2015.  However, no records of his reserve service have been associated with his claims file, and no further information was provided regarding VA's attempts to obtain those records other than one request for information in December 2022.  See December 2022 VA Form 21-3101 Request for Information.

As such, two pre-decisional duty to assist errors occurred because the AOJ did not make adequate efforts in properly associating the Veteran's VA medical records and reserve records with his claims file.  Remand is required to correct those errors.

VA Examination (Back Disability)

Next, the Board finds that a third duty to assist error occurred because the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination for his back disability.  While the Board is already remanding the Veteran's back disability claim due to the missing records described in the above section, it was also a duty to assist error to not afford the Veteran a VA examination.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Here, the April 2024 rating decision includes the favorable findings that (1) the Veteran's service treatment records show treatment for lower back pain in June 2012; and (2) the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability, specifically, back pain.  See April 2024 Rating Decision.  Those favorable findings show that the first two elements of service connection are met; however, no nexus statement or opinion exists in the evidence of record, meaning that the third element is not satisfied.

In December 2022, the Veteran reported he was traveling and could not schedule an examination until 2023.  See December 2022 Exam Request.  VA subsequently sent a letter to the Veteran, one day after the Veteran stated he was traveling, requesting that the Veteran contact VA to reschedule his examination or express his willingness to attend an examination.  The Veteran was notified that if VA did not hear from him within 30 days, a decision may be made on his claim.  See December 2022 Subsequent Development Letter.  The Veteran's claim was denied in January 2023, and he was not afforded a VA examination regarding his back disability before his claim was denied again in April 2024. 

Normally, if an examination is missed without good cause shown, then the Veteran's claims may be decided upon the evidence of record.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.  That said, the fact that the Veteran was traveling at the time of his original examination appointment was good cause to explain why his examination was cancelled and never rescheduled.  See December 2022 Exam Request.  While VA notified the Veteran that he may contact VA to reschedule his examination, the Veteran stated that he was not available until 2023, yet VA sent the notification letter in December 2022.  Moreover, the Veteran stated that he was "never given [an] appointment" for a VA examination for his back disability.  See November 2023 VA Form 20-0996; see also August 2024 VA Form 10182.  Such correspondence can be construed as the Veteran's willingness to attend an examination, as stipulated in the December 2022 subsequent development letter. 

As such, the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and concludes that his claim for entitlement to service connection for a back disability should be remanded because good cause exists to explain the Veteran's cancellation of the scheduled VA examination and failure to reschedule his examination.  It was a duty to assist error to not afford the Veteran a VA examination for his back disability.

The Board notes that a claimant has some responsibility to cooperate in the development of all facts pertinent to his claim and that the duty to assist is not a one-way street.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).  To this end, any failure to report for a scheduled examination without good cause may result in an adverse determination.

For the three reasons set out above, the issues of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus and entitlement to service connection for a back disability are remanded to correct the foregoing duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the rating decisions on appeal.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action(s):

1. Associate all outstanding VA treatment records with the Veteran's claims file.  If no VA treatment records exist for this Veteran, from anywhere in the VA network, please memorialize that finding with a negative search result.  If the search yields VA records that are not the Veteran's records, please also make note of that finding. 

2. Obtain records and line of duty determinations for all periods of active duty for training in the Navy Reserves.

3. Upon association of the above outstanding records with the Veteran's claims file and all associated further development, readjudicate the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus and for entitlement to service connection for a back disability. 

4. Readjudication must include a VA examination and a medical opinion addressing the Veteran's back disability.  The examiner is asked to address the following:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's back disability had its onset during active service or is otherwise causally or etiologically related to an in-service disease, event, or injury (i.e., direct service connection)?

(b.) The examiner is asked to consider the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) that show back pain in service.

5. In their rationale, the examiner is asked to provide: 

(a.) A clear and detailed rationale for the opinion, including a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved. 

(b.) If the examiner relies on medical treatises, the examiner should identify and discuss the treatises. 

(c.) If the examiner feels that the requested opinion cannot be rendered without resorting to speculation, the examiner must explain whether the need to speculate is caused by a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (i.e., no one could respond given medical science and the known facts) or by a deficiency in the record or the examiner (i.e., additional facts are required, or the examiner does not have the necessary knowledge or training).
