ORDER

Entitlement to a higher initial rating of 100 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and unspecified depressive disorder, from May 9, 2007 to present, is granted. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 9, 2007 for the award of eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is granted. 

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 22, 2020 for the grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disability is dismissed. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's PTSD and unspecified depressive disorder is characterized by total occupational and social impairment from May 9, 2007 to present. 

2. The Veteran met the criteria for DEA benefits beginning May 9, 2007.

3. The Veteran's claim for an effective date earlier than February 22, 2020 for the grant of a TDIU is moot because he has only one service-connected disability and it is rated at 100 percent disabling.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1979 to December 1980. 

By way of procedural history, the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder in May 2007 that was denied in a March 2008 rating decision under the Legacy appeal system. He requested reconsideration of the claim in February 2009, but the claim was denied in March 2010. He submitted a notice of disagreement in April 2010. A statement of the case was issued in March 2012. He perfected his appeal by submitting a substantive appeal in March 2012. The case was remanded by the Board in June 2014. A supplemental statement of the case was issued in May 2016. The case was again remanded by the Board in February 2017. While the claim was pending at the agency of jurisdiction, in April 2018, the Veteran opted in to the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP), a pilot program for the modernized review system created by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). He opted-in to the Higher-Level Review (HLR) option. A March 2019 RAMP HLR rating decision granted service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, rated as 50 percent disabling.

In December 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR for an increased rating and earlier effective date. The claim was denied in a March 2020 HLR rating decision. In response to a February 2020 VA Form 21-8940, Application for TDIU, an April 2020 rating decision granted an increased rating of 70 percent, entitlement to a TDIU from February 22, 2020, and entitlement to DEA from February 22, 2020. A supplemental claim was submitted in June 2020 for an increased rating for the acquired psychiatric disorder, an earlier effective date for TDIU, and an earlier effective date for DEA. The claims were denied in an August 2020 supplemental rating decision. The Veteran appealed with a May 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).

In the May 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on November 20, 2024. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2020 AOJ supplemental claim decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the November 2024 hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 50 percent prior to February 22, 2020 and in excess of 70 percent thereafter for PTSD and unspecified depressive disorder, to include entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 22, 2020 for the grant of a 70 percent rating. 

The Veteran contends he is entitled to a higher rating for his PTSD and/or an earlier effective date for the grant of a 70 percent rating. 

Currently, his acquired psychiatric disorder is rated as 50 percent disabling prior to February 22, 2020 and 70 percent disabling thereafter. 

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder did more nearly approximate the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 100 percent for the entire period on appeal.

VA and private treatment records, the October 2007, September 2009, March 2015, May 2017, and March 2020 VA examinations, the October 2020 private psychological evaluation from C.R., Ph.D., and the Veteran's lay statements show that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was manifested by symptoms associated with a 100 percent rating (gross impairment of thought process or communications, grossly inappropriate behavior, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene, and persistent danger of hurting self or others), resulting in the level of impairment of total occupational and social impairment. 

The October 2020 private psychological evaluation from C.R., Ph.D., stated the Veteran's psychiatric condition has been present most definitely during the period from May 9, 2007 to February 22, 2020, to a severe degree and resulting in total occupational and social impairment. C.R. determined the Veteran had symptoms such as gross impairment in thought processes or communications, disorientation to time or place, and intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene).

The October 2007, September 2009, March 2015, May 2017, and March 2020 VA examinations revealed symptoms such as inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances including work or a work like setting, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and suicidal ideation. The October 2007 VA examination revealed the Veteran's report of no friends, getting depressed about not being able to interact with people, and struggling with maintaining minimal personal hygiene but reportedly being able to go 4 to 5 weeks without bathing. The September 2009 VA examination noted the Veteran and his wife at that time were co-dependent with little social support system; ongoing conflicts with family, neighbors, and an ex-wife; 4 different orders of protection filed against him because of resentment and accusation of violence or threatened violence; and inability to maintain ongoing employment. The March 2015 and May 2017 VA examinations noted the Veteran's report of being frequently unemployed and inability to keep a job. During the March 2020 VA examination, the Veteran reported he has had 4 marriages since discharge and described himself as a loner. 

VA, Vet Center, and private treatment records reveal total occupational and social impairment due to symptoms such as gross impairment in thought processes or communication, grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent danger of hurting self shown by chronic suicidal ideation and inpatient admissions, and intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene). 

An August 2008 VA treatment record noted the Veteran had chronic suicidality, social isolation, poor relations with extended family, and internalized anger; he was admitted for inpatient hospitalization. In August 2009, he was admitted for increased depression/anxiety and endorsed visual hallucinations. In January 2010, a VA provider noted the Veteran had an order of protection placed against him, and observed the Veteran's mood was labile, speech hyperverbal, appeared grandiose in comments, and the Veteran made odd remarks about finding clarity and having superior intelligence. In an August 2010 VA treatment record, he reported that his wife kicked him out and filed an order of protection against him. In a December 2010 VA treatment record, he reported feeling "manicky" with depressed mood, not eating or sleeping well, and not taking care of himself properly. In a January 2011 VA treatment record, a treating provider stated the Veteran's poor compliance with medication and possible trauma-related issues have been instrumental in keeping the Veteran symptomatic and seriously disabled by his mental/emotional disorders. A July 2014 VA treatment record revealed the Veteran was brought to the hospital by the police for hiding the family gun, with pressured speech that cameras were watching him. He was thereafter admitted to another inpatient hospital stay due to increased paranoia, manic symptoms, with tangentiality and slightly pressured speech. 

An April 2008 private treatment record noted he was written up for calling in sick every day, and believed his place of work was an unsafe environment with harassment. An April 2008 initial mental health assessment noted that his wife was his only friend, and that his ex-wife had an order of protection against him. A September 2008 private treatment record noted anger outbursts and that the police department was called. 

Available Vet Center records reflect the Veteran had a history of suicidal thoughts and aggression. 

Further, in June 2009, a former employer revealed he was terminated for improper conduct.

In short, the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder results in total occupational and social impairment. Occupationally, the overall evidence reveals he has been unable to hold a job and was terminated from his last full-time job for improper conduct. Socially, the medical evidence reveals a history of multiple failed marriages, social isolation, and a legal history indicating aggression. The evidence additionally revealed chronic suicidal ideation and multiple hospital admissions for symptoms, visual hallucinations, and intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene.

As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of showing total occupational and social impairment, the Board concludes the maximum 100 percent rating is warranted for the entire duration of the appeal, from May 9, 2007 to present. Thus, the appeal is granted.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for basic eligibility to DEA.  

Regarding the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for DEA benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35, the Board finds that entitlement to an effective date of May 9, 2007 is warranted.

Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance, under Chapter 35, Title 38, of the United States Code, is a program of education or special restorative training that may be authorized for an eligible person, such as a surviving spouse, if the applicable criteria are met. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.3020, 21.3021.

Basic eligibility for certification of DEA exists if the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service, and either (1) has a permanent total service-connected disability, or (2) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death, or (3) died as a result of a service-connected disability, or, if a service member (4) is on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces and, for a period of more than 90 days, has been listed by VA concerned as missing in action, captured in the line of duty by a hostile force, or forcibly detained or interned in the line of duty by a foreign government or power. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

Based on the above grant of a 100 percent rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder from May 9, 2007, the Board concludes that entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 9, 2007 for basic eligibility to DEA benefits is warranted. The appeal is granted. 

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 22, 2020 for the grant of TDIU.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of a TDIU. 

A TDIU may be assigned "where the schedular rating is less than total" and the evidence shows that a veteran is precluded, by reason of his or her service-connected disabilities, from securing and following "substantially gainful employment" consistent with his or her education and occupational experience. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

In light of the above grant providing the Veteran with a 100 percent rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder, a grant of an earlier effective date for a TDIU is moot. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a Veteran is totally disabled. Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994), citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990). Thus, if VA has found a Veteran to be totally disabled as a result of a particular service-connected disability or combination of disabilities pursuant to the rating schedule, there is no need, and no authority to otherwise rate the Veteran totally disabled on any other basis. See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding a request for TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period). 

The Board acknowledges that the receipt of a 100 percent schedular disability rating for a service-connected disability or disabilities does not necessarily always moot the issue of entitlement to a TDIU because a TDIU rating may still form the basis for the assignment of special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008). 

However, entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) requires that the Veteran be in receipt of a total disability rating with additional service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the total disability rating. In the present case, the Veteran does not have any additional service-connected disabilities upon which TDIU could be based and, as such, Bradley is not for application here.

Accordingly, the issue of an earlier effective date for the grant of a TDIU is moot, and the appeal must be dismissed.
