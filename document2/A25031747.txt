Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 18, 2022 for the award of an increased, 20 percent disability evaluation for lumbosacral spine strain with intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 2002 to February 2006.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  The rating decision in this case was issued after February 19, 2019; thus, the AMA framework applies.

In a May 5, 2022 rating decision, in pertinent part, the AOJ awarded the Veteran an increased, 70 percent disability evaluation for PTSD and an increased, 20 percent disability evaluation for lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS.  An effective date of February 18, 2022 was assigned for each award of benefits.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on May 6, 2022.

The Veteran, on April 26, 2023, filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, requesting review of the May 2022 rating decision as to the disability evaluations assigned for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD and lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS, as well as the effective dates of the awards of increased disability evaluations for the Veteran's PTSD and lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS.

In a May 3, 2023 rating decision, the AOJ reviewed the evidence of record at the time of the prior rating decision and denied the Veteran's claim for an increased disability evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS.  The AOJ also awarded the Veteran an increased, 100 percent disability evaluation for his service-connected PTSD, effective February 18, 2022, as well as denied the Veteran's claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the awards of increased disability evaluations for the Veteran's PTSD and lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS.  The Veteran was notified of this rating decision on May 11, 2023.

The Veteran appealed the May 2023 rating decision to the Board by filing an April 26, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.  The Veteran requested Direct Review.  On May 16, 2024, the Board acknowledged receipt of the Veteran's Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182).  Accordingly, under its review, the Board will now only consider all evidence of record at the time of the May 11, 2023 notice of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.    

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 18, 2022 for the award of an increased, 100 percent disability evaluation for PTSD is remanded.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 18, 2022 for the award of an increased, 20 percent disability evaluation for lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS is remanded.

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

After a review of the record, the Board finds that the appropriate course of action in this case is to remand the Veteran's claims for earlier effective dates for the awards of increased disability evaluation is necessary.  In this regard, the Board observes that the Veteran was awarded service connection for PTSD in a February 18, 2018 rating decision; a 30 percent disability evaluation was assigned, effective November 10, 2017.  Also, in a March 22, 2018 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection for lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS; a 10 percent disability evaluation was assigned, effective November 10, 2017.  In response the Veteran submitted two VA Form 21-0958 (Notice of Disagreement), received by the AOJ on February 5, 2019 and February 14, 2019, wherein the Veteran indicated that he disagreed with initial disability evaluations assigned for his PTSD and lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS.  

Because the AOJ has not issued a Statement of the Case in the Veteran's appeal of the claims for increased initial disability evaluations for PTSD and lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS, and the Veteran has not waived AOJ review of additional records received since the filing of the February 2019 notice of disagreement, the Board must remand the Veteran's claims for issuance of a Statement of the Case.  When a claimant has filed a notice of disagreement and there is no statement of the case on file for that issue, the Board must remand, not refer, the issue to the RO for issuance of a statement of the case.  See Manlincon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 238, 240 (1999).

As the Veteran's claims for increased initial disability evaluations for PTSD and lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS remain unresolved, and the Board's adjudication of the Veteran's appeal of the claims for increased initial disability ratings for PTSD and lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS affect the Veteran's claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the awards of increased disability evaluations for PTSD and lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS, the Board finds that these claims are inextricably intertwined.  The appropriate remedy where pending claims are inextricably intertwined with claims currently on appeal is to remand the claims on appeal pending the adjudication of the inextricably intertwined claims.  Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991) (two or more issues are inextricably intertwined if one claim could have significant impact on the other).  Thus, adjudication of the claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the awards of increased disability evaluations for PTSD and lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS at this time would be premature.  Parker v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 116 (1994).  

Accordingly, the Board must defer appellate review of the Veteran's claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the awards of increased disability evaluations for PTSD and lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS pending resolution of the Veteran's separate appeal.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  The AOJ should issue a Statement of the Case regarding the issues of entitlement to increased initial disability evaluations for PTSD and lumbosacral spine strain with IVDS.  The appellant and his representative should be advised that, for the Board to have jurisdiction of these matters, a timely substantive appeal (VA Form 9) under the legacy system must be filed, or the Veteran may elect to opt-in to the AMA modernized review system by timely filing for a review option under the AMA in accordance with 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500.

2. Following resolution of the Veteran's appeals of the claim of entitlement to increased, initial disability evaluations for PTSD and lumbosacral strain with IVDS, the AOJ should readjudicate the claims on appeal.
