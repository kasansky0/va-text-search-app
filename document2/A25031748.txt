ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  During the appeal period, the Veteran had no worse than Level I hearing loss for the right and left ears.

2.   During the period on appeal, the Veteran's tinnitus has been assigned the maximum rating authorized under the applicable diagnostic code.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 4.1-4.14, 4.21, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100.

2.  There is no legal basis for the assignment of an initial schedular rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army from July 1981 to May 1985.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision.  As this rating decision constitutes an initial decision, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that the January 2024 rating decision on appeal granted entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss, assigning an initial noncompensable evaluation effective from July 17, 2023; and entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, assigning an initial 10 percent rating effective from July 17, 2023.  In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran identified the January 2024 rating decision and appeared to reference the decision's grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  The Board has construed this submission as seeking entitlement to initial increased ratings for these disabilities.

The Board additionally notes that September 2023 Security Administration (SSA) Inquiry Results indicated that the Veteran was in receipt Title II SSA disability benefits.  However, there is no indication or allegation that there is information contained in the SSA records that could show that the Veteran is entitled an increased rating for his bilateral hearing loss or tinnitus disabilities.  As any SSA records are therefore not relevant to these issues, the Board finds that there was no pre-decisional duty to assist error in not obtaining potentially outstanding records from the SSA in relation these claims.  See Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2010) ("The legal standard for relevance requires VA to examine the information it has related to medical records and if there exists a reasonable possibility that the records could help the veteran substantiate his claim for benefits, the duty to assist requires VA to obtain the records").

1.  Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (rating schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. § Part 4.  Disability ratings are intended to compensate impairment in earning capacity due to a service connected disorder.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  The evaluation of a service-connected disorder requires a review of a veteran's entire medical history regarding that disorder.  38 U.S.C. § 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  When a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Evidence to be considered in an appeal from an initial disability rating was not limited to that reflecting the then current severity of the disorder.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  In contrast, for an already established service-connected disability, the present disability level is the primary concern and past medical reports do not take precedence over current findings.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  For both types of increased rating claims, it is possible for a veteran to be awarded separate percentage evaluations for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period.  See Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509 (2007).  Such separate disability ratings are known as staged ratings.

The January 2024 rating decision granted entitlement to an initial noncompensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss effective from July 17, 2023.  As a result, the appeal period begins on July 17, 2023.  The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

In evaluating service-connected hearing loss, disability ratings are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are performed.  Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992).  Evaluations of bilateral hearing loss range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on an organic impairment of hearing acuity, as measured by controlled speech discrimination tests in conjunction with the average hearing threshold, as measured by puretone audiometric tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second.  The rating schedule establishes 11 auditory acuity Levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing through Level XI for profound deafness.

VA audiological evaluations are conducted using a controlled speech discrimination test together with the results of puretone audiometry tests.  The vertical line in Table VI (printed in 38 C.F.R. § § 4.85) represents nine categories of decibel I loss based on the puretone audiometry test.  The numeric designation of impaired hearing (Levels I through XI) is determined for each ear by intersecting the vertical row appropriate for the percentage of discrimination and the horizontal column appropriate to puretone decibel loss.  The percentage evaluation is found from Table VII (in 38 C.F.R. § 4.85) by intersecting the vertical column appropriate for the numeric designation for the ear having the better hearing acuity and the horizontal row appropriate for the numeric designation of the level for the ear having the poorer hearing acuity.  For example, if the better ear had a numeric designation of Level "V," and the poorer ear had a numeric designation of Level "VII," the percentage evaluation is 30 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

Regulations also provide that in cases of exceptional hearing loss, i.e., when the puretone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1,000, 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 hertz) is 55 decibels or more, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Each ear will be evaluated separately.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85(a).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b) further provide that when the puretone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1,000 hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2,000 hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or VIa, whichever results in the higher numeral.  That numeral will then be evaluated to the next higher Roman numeral.

During the appeal period, the Veteran was provided with a VA examination in connection with his claim in January 2024.  The Veteran's pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were recorded as:

			HERTZ		

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Average

RIGHT	15	15	30	45	26

LEFT	15	20	30	50	29

The examiner noted that the puretone test results were valid for rating purposes.  The Veteran's speech discrimination score based on the Maryland CNC word list was 94 percent bilaterally.  The examiner also stated that the use of speech discrimination score was appropriate for the Veteran.  The examiner noted under the remarks pertaining to hearing loss that in relation to difficulties that the Veteran had with his hearing, he missed things people said and indicated that he misunderstood conversations.  Nevertheless, in terms of the functional impact of the Veteran's hearing loss, the examiner noted that the Veteran's hearing loss did not impact ordinary conditions of daily life, including ability to work.  The examiner specifically stated under the remarks that the Veteran denied having a history of ear infections, ear surgery, head trauma, vertigo, or aural fullness.  The examiner also observed that although the Veteran had a cerumen impaction, it was able to be removed to allow for audiological testing to be performed.  There was no indication from the report that the cerumen impaction was associated with the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability.

The Board first notes that the use of Table VIa is not appropriate for the right or left ear as the puretone thresholds from this examination did not fall within the exceptional patterns of hearing loss contemplated by 38 C.F.R. § 4.86; and the examiner reported that the use of a speech discrimination score was appropriate for the Veteran.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(c).

Under Table VI, the Veteran's puretone threshold average and speech discrimination score yield a Roman numeral of I for both ears.  The application of these values to Table VII results in a noncompensable evaluation.

There is also no evidence or argument that the Veteran experienced any symptoms associated with his bilateral hearing loss, in addition to those for which he is already being compensated under Diagnostic Code 6100, that would warrant secondary service connection or separate ratings.  Cf. Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 2023 (2021); see also Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an initial compensable evaluation for his bilateral hearing loss.  Although the Board has considered the Veteran's contention that he is entitled to a compensable rating, the assignment of disability ratings for hearing impairment are derived by a mechanical application of the Rating Schedule to the numeric designations based on the audiology examination results.  See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992).  The Rating Schedule reflects that a higher rating can be awarded only when loss of hearing has reached a specified measurable level. Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and a compensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

The Board has additionally considered whether an extraschedular rating is warranted for the service-connected bilateral hearing loss during the relevant period on appeal based on the Veteran's description of difficulties caused by his hearing loss.  Ratings shall be based as far as practicable upon the average impairments of earning capacity with the additional proviso that the Secretary shall from time to time readjust this schedule of ratings in accordance with experience.  To accord justice, therefore, to the exceptional case where the schedular ratings are found to be inadequate, the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director, Compensation and Pension Service, upon field station submission, is authorized to approve on the basis of the criteria set forth in this paragraph an extraschedular rating commensurate with the average earning capacity impairment due exclusively to the service-connected disability or disabilities.  The governing norm in these exceptional cases is:  A finding that the case presents such an exceptional or unusual disability picture with such related factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization as to render impractical the application of the regular schedular standards.  38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has clarified that there is a three-step inquiry for determining whether a veteran is entitled to an extraschedular rating.  Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 115 (2008).  Initially, the Board must determine whether the evidence presents such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular ratings for the service connected disability are inadequate.  See Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484 (2016); Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (holding that either the veteran must assert that a schedular rating is inadequate or the evidence must present exceptional or unusual circumstances); Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472, 478 (2016) ("[t]he rating schedule must be deemed inadequate before extraschedular consideration is warranted").  Second, if the schedular rating does not contemplate the veteran's level of disability and symptomatology and is found inadequate, the Board must determine whether the veteran's disability picture exhibits other related factors such as marked interference with employment and frequent periods of hospitalization.  Thun, 22 Vet. App. at 116.  Third, if the first two Thun elements have been satisfied, then the case must be referred to the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service to determine whether, to accord justice, the veteran's disability picture requires the assignment of an extraschedular rating.  Thun, 22 Vet. App. at 116.  In other words, the first element of Thun compares a veteran's symptoms to the rating criteria, while the second element considers the resulting effects of those symptoms; if either prong is not met, then referral for extraschedular consideration is not appropriate.  Yancy, 27 Vet. App. at 494-95.

The Veteran has indicated that his hearing loss causes him difficulties in communication with others, including misunderstanding conversations and missing things that were said.

With respect to the first prong of Thun, the evidence in the instant appeal does not establish such an exceptional disability picture as to render the schedular criteria inadequate.  A comparison between the level of severity and symptomatology of the Veteran's assigned evaluation with the established criteria found in the rating schedule shows that the rating criteria reasonably describe his disability level and symptomatology.  In this regard, the Board finds that the Veteran's reports of his difficulty hearing and understanding speech constitute symptomatology and impairment contemplated in the rating criteria for hearing loss.  Indeed, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the rating criteria for hearing loss contemplate the functional effects of decreased hearing and difficulty understanding speech, as these are the effects that VA's audiometric tests are designed to measure.  The Court further indicated that "when a claimant's hearing loss results in an inability to hear or understand speech or to hear other sounds in various contexts, those effects are contemplated by the schedular rating criteria."  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369 (2017).  VA also added Table VIA with the intent of fairly and accurately assessing the hearing disabilities of veterans as reflected in a real-life industrial setting.  59 Fed. Reg. 17295, 17296 (April 12, 1994).  In other words, a separate table was added to the schedular rating criteria to address the symptomatology of exceptional patterns of hearing impairment which were not demonstrated in this case.

The Board finds that any functional effects that may be associated with missing things that were said by others or misunderstanding conversations are the result of the Veteran's difficulty hearing and understanding speech which are contemplated by the rating criteria.  It logically follows that difficulty hearing and understanding speech would impact a veteran in a variety of ways, including in communication with others, but the rating schedule is not written to account for every possible consequence associated with each symptom.  The Court in Doucette reviewed a similar factual situation, inasmuch as the Board had considered that claimant's report of being embarrassed from having to ask others to repeat themselves, among other reported difficulties, in finding that the resultant effect of the reported symptoms, in combination, was difficulty hearing.  The Court determined that the claimant had not alleged any symptoms in that case that could be considered exceptional or unusual for a claimant suffering from hearing loss.  See Doucette, 28 Vet. App. at 372-73.

Based on the foregoing, it cannot be said that the available schedular evaluations are inadequate.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the requirements for an extraschedular evaluation under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1) have not been met.  Bagwell v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 337 (1996); Shipwash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 218 (1995); Thun, supra; Doucette, supra.

The regulations also provide that consideration of whether special monthly compensation (SMC) is warranted is required when evaluating any claim for impaired hearing.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(g).  Certain levels of SMC may be awarded for deafness.  However, the SMC criteria require bilateral deafness or some other service-connected disability, such as blindness, which do not apply to the Veteran's case.  38 U.S.C. § 1114; 38 C.F.R. § § 3.350.  Therefore, SMC based on bilateral deafness is not warranted for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss.

2.  Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus.

The Veteran has been in receipt of an initial 10 percent rating for tinnitus effective from July 17, 2023.  As a result, the appeal period begins on July 17, 2023.  

Tinnitus is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260, which was revised effective June 13, 2003, to clarify existing VA practice that only a single 10 percent rating is assigned for tinnitus, whether the sound is perceived as being in one ear, both ears, or in the head.  This is the maximum schedular rating assignable for that condition.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) affirmed VA's long-standing interpretation of DC 6260 as authorizing only a single 10 percent rating for tinnitus, whether perceived as unilateral or bilateral.  Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  In sum, the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus is assigned the maximum schedular rating available for tinnitus under 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260, and there is no legal basis upon which to award more than a single 10 percent rating.

The Veteran was provided with a VA examination related to his tinnitus disability in January 2024, and the examiner noted that the Veteran had recurrent tinnitus.  Regarding the functional impact of the Veteran's tinnitus, the examiner stated that the Veteran's tinnitus did not impact ordinary conditions of daily life, including ability to work.  There is also no other evidence or argument that the Veteran has experienced any symptoms associated with his tinnitus, in addition to those for which he is already being compensated under Diagnostic Code 6260, that would warrant secondary service connection or separate ratings.  Cf. Bailey, 33 Vet. App. at 2023; see also Doucette, 28 Vet. App. at 369-70.

Moreover, the Board again notes that the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus has been assigned the maximum schedular rating available for tinnitus of 10 percent under 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260.  In light of the above, the claim for an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus must be denied as a matter of law.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

For both the initial increased rating claims on appeal for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, the Board has also considered whether the record has raised the issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009).  During the available evidentiary review period up to the time of the January 2024 rating decision, the Veteran was service-connected for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  A separate December 2023 VA examination related to headaches indicated that the Veteran had a history of part-time employment as a security guard.  However, the record does not suggest that the Veteran has been unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disabilities.  The January 2024 VA examiner noted that both the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus did not impact ordinary conditions of daily life, including ability to work.  Absent any indication or contention that the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disabilities during the applicable evidentiary review period, consideration of a TDIU is not warranted.  Thus, the record does not reasonably raise the issue of TDIU.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
