ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for atopic dermatitis is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for breast cancer is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for depression as secondary to breast cancer is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

During the appeal period, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.  Also, the Veteran did not both have a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and require continuous medication for control.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable rating for service-connected hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 1994 to June 1998.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of atopic dermatitis, breast cancer, and depression, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension is denied.

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for the initial rating of hypertension. See March 2024 VA Form 10182: Notice of Disagreement. 

Hypertension is rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension).  Under DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria.  Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common."  See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

For the reasons that follow, the Veteran's hypertension has not more nearly approximated the criteria corresponding to a 10 percent rating.

While the Veteran's hypertension is treated with medication, there is no evidence of record showing a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more. See June 2023 VA Examination. The Veteran's June 2023 VA examination and VA treatment records fail to show any diastolic pressure readings of 100 or more. Therefore, the Board must deny the Veteran's claim for an increased rating of hypertension. The Veteran's hypertension does not more nearly approximate the criteria corresponding to a 10 percent rating.

As the criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 7101 are not met, a noncompensable rating is warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service Connection: 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, space, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §1110; 38 C.F.R. §3.303 (a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. §3.303 (d). 

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a)-(b).  Secondary causation exists when, but for the service-connected disability, the non-service-connected was caused by a service-connected disability either in a direct, etiological way or via multiple steps in a causal chain.  Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (citations omitted).  Secondary aggravation exists when the non-service-connected disability not caused by a service-connected disability would be less severe were it not for a service-connected disability.  Id. at 1364.  For example, secondary aggravation may be established where the natural progression of the non-service-connected disability could have been arrested or improved but for the service-connected disability.  Id. 

Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson reports a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. In fact, competent medical evidence is not necessarily required when the determinative issue involves medical etiology or medical diagnosis. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C.§5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for breast cancer is remanded.

The Veteran contends she is entitled to service connection for breast cancer based on exposure to radiation while in service. See April 2023 Veteran Statement. Specifically, the Veteran contends she was exposed to radiation when hydro blasting submarines while on active duty. Id. 

The Board has identified a duty to assist error that occurred before the July 2023rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The Veteran was not afforded a VA Examination for her breast cancer condition. In McLendon v. Nicholson, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ("CAVC") held that an examination is required when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing an "in-service event, injury, or disease," or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) and indication that the current disability may be related to the in-service event, but (4) insufficient evidence to decide the case. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-83 (2006). Here, the Veteran has a breast cancer diagnosis and contends it was caused by exposure to radiation while in service. The Board must remand this matter for a VA examination and adequate opinion regarding the nexus between the Veteran's breast cancer and potential exposure to radiation. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for atopic dermatitis is remanded.

The Veteran contends she is entitled to service-connected atopic dermatitis because the condition began in service. See April 2023 Claim. 

The Board has identified a duty to assist error that occurred before the July 2023rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The Veteran was afforded a VA Examination for her skin condition in June 2023; however, the examiner determined the Veteran's atopic dermitis was not related to her in-service reports of atopic dermatis because her condition resolved in 2019. However, in the June 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted the Veteran had a current skin condition of atopic dermatis. Based on this discrepancy, the Board finds this exam to be inadequate and cannot make a fully informed decision on this issue. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). The Board must remand this matter for an adequate opinion.

3. Entitlement to service connection for depression as secondary to breast cancer is remanded.

The Veteran contends she is entitled to service connection for depression, secondary to her breast cancer diagnosis. See April 2023 Claim. 

The Board has identified a duty to assist error that occurred before the July 2023rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination for her mental health condition. Further, the Veteran's depression claim is inextricably intertwined with the Veteran's remanded claim for service connection for breast cancer. Therefore, a remand for the Veteran's depression claim is remanded for a VA examination.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for the breast cancer claim.  The examiner must review the claims file.

If a diagnosis cannot be provided but the Veteran's condition manifests in symptoms that cause functional impairment, then the examiner should consider them a "disability" for the purpose of providing the requested opinion(s) below.

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

Is the Veteran's breast cancer at least as likely as not related to service, including in service exposure?

Provide a rationale to support the opinion(s).  

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's atopic dermatitis is at least as likely as not related to her in-service diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.

3. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for depression.  The examiner must review the claims file.

If a diagnosis cannot be provided but the Veteran's condition manifests in symptoms that cause functional impairment, then the examiner should consider them a "disability" for the purpose of providing the requested opinion(s) below.

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

Is the Veteran's depression at least as likely as not related to service?

Provide a rationale to support the opinion(s).  

Is the Veteran's depression at least as likely as not proximately due to her breast cancer diagnosis?

Is the Veteran's depression at least as likely as not aggravated, i.e., made worse, by her breast cancer diagnosis?
