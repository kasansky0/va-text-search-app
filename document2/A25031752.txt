ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of November 1, 2017 for insomnia, unspecified anxiety, and alcohol use disorder, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

1. On November 1, 2017, the Veteran submitted an intent to file form.

2. In March 2018, the Veteran submitted a formal claim for a mental health condition, which was denied in the July 2018 rating decision, and was timely appealed in the February 2019 notice of disagreement.

3. In the March 2019 rating decision, the Veteran's claim for mental health condition to include depressed mood, adjustment disorder, and mixed anxiety denial was continued, and was timely appealed in the July 2019 rating decision, which was pending.

4. In the January 2024 rating decision, the Veteran's claim was eventually granted which combined the Veteran's claim for insomnia with his mental health claims including anxiety.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of November 1, 2017 for insomnia, unspecified anxiety, and alcohol use disorder, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.160; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(c), 3.159, 3.400, 19.20, 19.21, 19.52, 20.1103.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from July 1984 to July 2010. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of the January 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran specifically noted the March 2019 rating decision which is more than a year prior to the April 2024 Notice of Disagreement, but affording the Veteran reasonable doubt, the Board finds that the January 2024 rating decision may be appealed instead.

In the April 12, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 RO decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with regard to the duty to notify or duty to assist as they pertain to the issues considered in this decision. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

The analysis in this decision focuses on the most relevant evidence and on what the evidence shows or does not show with respect to the issues denied in this decision. The Veteran should not assume that evidence that is not explicitly discussed in this decision has been overlooked. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (noting that the law requires only that reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant be addressed).

EFFECTIVE DATES

The effective date based on the submission of new and material evidence received after a final disallowance is the date of the receipt of the new claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.40(q)(2) (previously 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(1)(ii)), 3.400(r). The effective date for the grant of service connection following a final decision is the date of the reopened claim. See Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 248 (2002) (holding that 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) "is clear on its face with respect to granting an effective date for an award of VA periodic monetary benefits no earlier than the date that the claim for reopening was filed").

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) explained that the statutory framework does not allow for the Board to reach back to the date of the original claim as a possible effective date for an award of service-connected benefits based on a reopened claim. Id. (holding that the term "new claim," as it appeared in 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q), means a claim to reopen a previously and finally decided claim).

Regulations that were in effect prior to March 24, 2015, required that an informal claim "must identify the benefit sought." See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.160. The regulations also provided that a claim may be either a formal or informal written communication "requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). The regulations in effect since March 24, 2015, do not allow for informal claims that are not submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.160. The Board will apply the regulations in effect prior to March 24, 2015, for all communications received prior to March 24, 2015.	

Thus, the essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79 (2009). VA must look to all communications from a claimant that may be interpreted as applications or claims, formal and informal, for benefits and is required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits. Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198 (1992). However, VA is not required to anticipate any potential claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998); Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats. The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155). The amendments apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

A specific claim in the form prescribed by VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a) (previously 38 U.S.C. § 3001(a)); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim. See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application, therefore. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) (previously 38 U.S.C. § 3010(a)). The effective date for an award of service connection is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date is the later of the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement to service connection arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Further, under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). For decisions rendered after a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182. Id. For supplemental claims received more than one year after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

A claimant may withdraw a supplemental claim or a request for a higher-level review at any time before VA renders a decision on the issue. A claimant must submit in writing or through electronic submission in a manner prescribed by the Secretary any notice of withdrawal of an issue under the selected review option to the agency of original jurisdiction. The withdrawal will be effective the date VA receives it. A claimant may withdraw an appeal to the Board of Veteran's Appeals as prescribed in § 20.205. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(d)

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must be against the claim. Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996).

Entitlement to an effective date of November 1, 2017 for insomnia, unspecified anxiety, and alcohol use disorder, mild

The Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement in April 2024 appealing the March 2019 rating decision, and noted that the issue was service connection. The Board construes the Veteran's claim as a claim for an earlier effective. The Veteran has not presented any particular argument for his claim.

On November 1, 2017, the Veteran submitted an intent to file form. In March 2018, the Veteran submitted a formal claim for a mental health condition. In the July 2018 rating decision, the Veteran's mental health claim was denied, as there was no current diagnosed disability. In February 2019, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement for his mental health disability. In the March 2019 rating decision, the denial  of the Veteran's claim for mental health condition to include depressed mood, adjustment disorder, and mixed anxiety was continued. In July 2019, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement, and opted into AMA.

In August 2022, the Veteran submitted a new claim for a sleep condition. In a September 2022 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with insomnia. In the November 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection for insomnia, effective August 15, 2022. 

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a claim for major depression and anxiety. In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim application for mental health appealing the March 2019 rating decision. In September 2023 the Veteran submitted a claim for depression. In November 2023, the Veteran again submitted a claim for depression. In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a separate claim for anxiety. In the January 2024 rating decision, the Veteran's insomnia, and mental health conditions (unspecified anxiety, and alcohol use disorder, mild), were combined into one rating which was increased to 30 percent effective May 31, 2023. 

The Board finds that an earlier effective date of November 1, 2017 is warranted for the Veteran's insomnia and mental health conditions (unspecified anxiety, and alcohol use disorder, mild). The Veteran has continuously prosecuted his claim since the November 1, 2017 intent to file form was submitted. The Board finds that the March 2019 rating decision remained pending, as the Veteran submitted a timely notice of disagreement. While the Veteran's claim for insomnia was granted, his other claims were not addressed until he filed additional claims in August 2023 and September 2023 for depression and anxiety. Thus, the Board finds an earlier effective date of November 1, 2017 for service connection for the Veteran's mental health conditions including insomnia, anxiety and alcohol abuse disorder is warranted, as this is the date the Veteran filed his intent to file form.
