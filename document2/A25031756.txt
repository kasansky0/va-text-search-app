ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for spondylolisthesis is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's spondylolisthesis is related to his active duty service.? 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for spondylolisthesis are met.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107;?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.???

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2008 to May 2016, to include service in Afghanistan.?? 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that denied the claim of service connection for low back pain.  The Board is bound by the favorable findings in the decision that the Veteran has a diagnosis of spondylolisthesis and service treatment records noted a complaint of back pain.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).?? 

The Veteran timely appealed the January 2024 rating decision in an August 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182)?and?selected direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).? 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(b)(1).? Accordingly, the Board will?review the evidence of record as of the date of the February 2023 rating decision that led to the?Higher-Level Review Request and the January 2024 rating decision.? 38 U.S.C. § 7113(a);?38 C.F.R. § 20.301.? The Board will not consider evidence added to the record after the date of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.? If evidence was added during any ineligible period, the Board did not consider it.? If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, he may at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision?and?the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).? If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the grant of the benefit sought.? 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2)(B);?38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).???? 

Entitlement to service connection for spondylolisthesis 

The Veteran contends that he injured his back when his vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan and that he has experienced back pain symptoms since that incident.???In addition, as discussed further below, the Board finds that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy while deployed to Afghanistan.  

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service. ?38 U.S.C. § 1110;?38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).? Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two.? Saunders v. Wilkie,?886 F.3d 1356, 1361?(Fed. Cir. 2018).? Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).???? 

For the following reasons, entitlement to service connection for spondylolisthesis is warranted.???? 

The Board is bound by the favorable finding in the January 2024 rating decision that the Veteran has a diagnosis of spondylolisthesis.  Thus, the Veteran meets the current disability requirement for the claim. 

The Board is bound by the favorable finding in the January 2024 rating decision that service treatment records noted the Veteran's complaint of back pain.  Therefore, the Veteran meets the in-service injury requirement for the claim. 

When there is no award signifying?combat, a?combat?determination must be made on a case by case basis.  VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (October 18, 1999).  This is important because finding a veteran engaged in?combat?allows a?combat?veteran to use satisfactory lay or other evidence to establish that he was injured or incurred a disability while on active duty, even in cases where there is no official record that such injury or disability occurred.  Reeves v. Shinseki,?682 F.3d 988, 998?(Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting?38 U.S.C. § 1154(b)).  A finding that a veteran engaged in?combat with the enemy under?38 U.S.C. § 1154(b) and?38 C.F.R. § 3.304(d) requires that the veteran participated in events constituting an actual fight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit or instrumentality and does not apply to veterans who served in a general "combat?area" or "combat?zone," but did not themselves engage in?combat?with the enemy.  Evidence submitted to support a claim that a veteran engaged in?combat?may include the veteran's own statements and an "almost unlimited" variety of other types of evidence.  Gaines v. West,?11 Vet. App. 353, 359?(1998).  The Court has held that receiving enemy fire or firing on an enemy can constitute participation in?combat.  Sizemore v. Principi,?18 Vet. App. 264 (2004). 

Given the Veteran's military personnel records, to include his DD Form 214 noting his service in Afghanistan and his military occupational specialty (MOS) of infantryman, and the Veteran's consistent reports, to include those made in a November 2022 Statement in Support of Claim (VA Form 21-4138), that he was exposed to an IED blast in Afghanistan, which is credible and consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service in Afghanistan, the evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether he engaged in?combat?with the enemy.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran engaged in?combat?with the enemy.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.102?(benefit of the doubt doctrine applies to any point within a claim and not merely its ultimate disposition);?38 U.S.C. § 1154(b) (specifying application of the benefit of the doubt doctrine in favor of?combat veterans).  Moreover, the fact that the Veteran engaged in?combat?with the enemy not only assists him in establishing the in-service disease or injury element but may also assist him in establishing the incurrence of the disability itself.  Reeves,?682 F.3d at 998. 

The Veteran has reported throughout the entire appeal period, to include during a December 2022 VA examination and in a November 2022 VA Form 21-4138, that he has experienced back pain symptoms both in and since his separation from active duty service.? Buchanan v. Nicholson,?451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (holding lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence).? Moreover, the Veteran's reports of back pain symptoms both in and since separation from service are bolstered by his February 2016 separation examination documenting recurrent back pain.  Thus, the Board finds these reports credible and therefore competent as they have been both corroborated and consistent throughout the appeal period.?? 

Moreover, after review of the Veteran's medical history and the circumstances and events of his military service, a private chiropractor in November 2022 found that the Veteran's spondylolisthesis was at least as likely as not a direct result of military service.  The chiropractor reasoned that the Veteran had no other known risk factors that may have precipitated his condition and that the Veteran's type of injury was acquired from large scale trauma.  This opinion is therefore entitled to significant probative weight as the chiropractor explained the reasons for the conclusion based on an accurate characterization of the evidence of record.? Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake,?22 Vet. App. 295, 304?(2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning);?Acevedo?v. Shinseki,?25 Vet. App. 286, 294?(2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole?and?in the context of the evidence of record).  

A December 2022 VA opinion that found it less likely than not that the Veteran's spondylolisthesis was related to service given there was no continuity of symptoms after separation from service is inadequate as it did not consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding continuous back pain symptoms both in and since separation from service.  Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1336 (VA's examiner's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the veteran's] disability such that his claim for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence"). 

In addition, as noted above, the fact that the Veteran engaged in combat during service does not prevent him from also invoking the section 1154(b) presumption in order to show that he incurred the disabilities while in service.  Reeves, 682 F.3d at 999.  Given the application of 38 U.S.C. § 1154(b) as explained in Reeves, the evidence of record discussed above provides a sufficient basis to conclude that his back disability was incurred in or caused by service. 

For the above reasons, the evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's spondylolisthesis is related to his active duty service.? As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for spondylolisthesis is warranted.? 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b);?38 C.F.R. § 3.102.????
