ORDER

Entitlement to a higher level of compensation for the grant of special monthly compensation (SMC) at the "housebound" rate is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The level of compensation for the grant of SMC at the "housebound" rate is set by law.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a higher level of compensation for the grant of SMC at the "housebound" rate have not been met.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1114; 38 C.F.R. § 3.351(d)(1).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active-duty service from June 1993 to June 1997 and June 1999 to September 1999.  

The issue is on appeal under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) from a rating decision issued in April 2023.  The Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement in July 2023 electing the direct review lane.   

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the Veteran's claims related to his left and right ankle, left and right knees, left and right hips, chronic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, erectile dysfunction, back, neck, transverse myelitis, left and right lower extremities, obesity, and stool burden were also addressed on the July 2023 NOD.  However, as these appeals were repeated in September and October 2023 NODs, the Board has addressed them a single time in separate Board decisions so as to consolidate the issues and not provide repetitive findings.  

Entitlement to a higher level of compensation for the grant of SMC at the "housebound" rate.

The law provides that SMC(s) is warranted if the veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total, and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) by reason of such disability or disabilities, the veteran is permanently housebound.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1114; 38 C.F.R. § 3.351(d)(1).  

SMC(s) was granted as the Veteran was rated at 100 percent for his psychiatric disability and had additional service-connected disabilities rated at 60 percent or more combined.  The level of compensation for SMC(s) is set by law.  As such a higher level of compensation may not be granted under SMC(s) regulations.  

To receive a higher level of compensation, the evidence must show the need for aid and attendance.  Entitlement to SMC for aid and attendance was denied in a February 2025 rating decision.  The Veteran may appeal that decision should he disagree with the finding.  

As such, entitlement to a higher level of compensation for the grant of SMC(s) at the housebound rate is denied as a matter of law.
