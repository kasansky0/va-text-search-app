ORDER

The July 16, 2020, motion for revision, on the basis of clear and unmistakable error, of an unidentified rating decision is dismissed without prejudice to refiling.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's July 16, 2020, motion for revision, on the basis of clear and unmistakable error, does not identify a specific rating decision that he seeks to revise. 

2. The Veteran's July 16, 2020, motion for revision, on the basis of clear and unmistakable error, does not set forth clearly and specifically the alleged clear and unmistakable error, or errors, of fact or law in a prior decision, the legal or factual basis for such allegations, and why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error(s).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the Veteran's July 16, 2020, motion for revision, on the basis of clear and unmistakable error, are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1973 until his honorable discharge in August 1978.

On March 8, 2023, the Veteran filed a motion to advance his appeal on the Board of Veterans' Appeals' (Board) docket, asserting financial hardship. 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c)(1). This appeal reached the undersigned Veterans Law Judge prior to a ruling on the motion by the Vice Chairman or Deputy Vice Chairman of the Board. For reasons discussed herein, the Board is dismissing the Veteran's July 16, 2020, motion for revision, on the basis of clear and unmistakable error. Consequently, the Board need not address the Veteran's motion to advance his appeal on the docket. The Board finds no prejudice results to the Veteran by not addressing his motion for advancement because there are no other pending appeals at the Board, and he is free to refile such a motion if he appeals to the Board in the future. See Vogan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 159, 163 (2010) (discussing harmless error). 

This case comes before the Board on appeal from a December 28, 2021, Rating Decision, issued by a Regional Office of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The Board received VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on September 27, 2022, from the Veteran. He elected the Direct Review docket. An October 4, 2022, Board letter informed the Veteran and his representative that his appeal had been formally placed on the Board's Direct Review docket. 

Evidentiary Standards

In the context of an appeal based on the allegation of clear and unmistakable error, "[r]eview for clear and unmistakable error in a prior final decision of an agency of original jurisdiction must be based on the evidentiary record and the law that existed when that decision was made." 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(iii); Pierce v. Principi, 240 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (holding that "evidence" in 38 U.S.C. § 5109A(a) is limited to evidence that was of record at the time of the challenged decision). Subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision. See Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233, 235?36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999). To the extent the evidentiary-window provisions of the Modernized Appellate Review system (AMA) conflict with the evidentiary-window provisions associated with motions based on clear and unmistakable error, 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(iii), the law provides that the evidentiary-window provisions associated with motions based on clear and unmistakable error control. 

The law requires the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran. Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128?29 (2000). The Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence. Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence in relation to the Veteran's motion.

Clear and Unmistakable Error

Generally, a decision of a VA Regional Office that is not timely appealed becomes final and binding in the absence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103. A previous determination that is final and binding will be presumed correct in the absence of CUE. Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 44 (1993). If the evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or revised, and a finding of CUE has the same effect as if the correct decision had been made on the date of the prior decision. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.105(a).

"CUE is a very specific and rare kind of 'error' . . . of fact or law that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the results would have been manifestly different but for the error." Simon v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 403, 408 (2018) (quoting Fugo, 6 Vet. App. at 43). Thus, even where the premise of error is accepted, if it is not clear that a different result would have ensued, the error complained of cannot be clear and unmistakable. Fugo, 6 Vet. App at 43?44. 

To establish CUE, a claimant must demonstrate the following three elements:

(1)	either (a) the correct facts as they were known at the time were not before the adjudicator, (b) the adjudicator made an erroneous factual finding, or (c) the statutory or regulatory provisions extant at the time were incorrectly applied; 

(2)	the error was undebatable and amounted to more than a disagreement with how the facts were weighed or the law applied; and 

(3)	the outcome of the claim would be manifestly different had the error not occurred. 

Simon, 30 Vet. App. at 407. A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset. King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014).

Analysis

By way of background, the Veteran separated from active military service in August 1978. Within a year of separation from service, he filed a claim for service connection for a nervous disorder. He was diagnosed by a medical professional with undifferentiated schizophrenia. In a February 1, 1980, Rating Decision, the VA Regional Office granted the Veteran service connection for undifferentiated schizophrenia and assigned an initial disability rating of 30 percent effective August 17, 1978. 

In a January 14, 1982, Rating Decision, the VA Regional Office found that the Veteran's psychiatric disability did not manifest in compensable symptoms. Thus, it reduced his disability rating to a noncompensable rating effective April 1, 1982. 

His noncompensable disability rating was subsequently confirmed and continued in March 12, 1997, and October 28, 2014, Rating Decisions.

In a September 15, 2020, Rating Decision, the VA Regional Office found that the Veteran's psychiatric disability manifested as symptoms consistent with a 50 percent disability rating. It assigned a 50 percent disability rating effective March 22, 2020. 

On July 16, 2020, the Veteran, through his attorney-representative, filed a motion for revision based on clear and unmistakable error. 

As a threshold matter, CUE motions must meet the particularized filing requirements identified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(vii) ("Filing Requirements"). Relevant to the basis for dismissal here, 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(vii)(A) states: "The request must include the name of the claimant; the name of the requesting party if other than the claimant; the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number; and the date of the decision to which the request relates." (Emphasis added.) Courts treat the word "must" as mandatory absent reason to do otherwise. See O'Farrell v. Dep't of Def., 882 F.3d 1080, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (referring to word "must" as a "mandatory term"); K-Con, Inc. v. Sec'y of Army, 908 F.3d 719, 725 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (similar) (both citing Kingdomware Techs., Inc. v. United States, 579 U.S. 162, 136 S. Ct. 1969, 1977, 195 L. Ed. 2d 334 (2016)).

In addition, section 3.105(a)(1)(vii)(B) provides that 

The request must set forth clearly and specifically the alleged clear and unmistakable error, or errors, of fact or law in the prior decision, the legal or factual basis for such allegations, and why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error. Non-specific allegations of failure to follow regulations or failure to give due process, or any other general, non-specific allegations of error, are insufficient to satisfy the requirement of the previous sentence.

38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(vii)(B) (emphasis added). 

The Board observes that the Veteran has been represented by an attorney since the filing of his CUE Motion. Where a claimant is unrepresented or represented by a non-attorney, VA must read a CUE motion sympathetically before consideration of the heightened pleading requirements. Comer v. Peake, 552 F.3d 1362, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2009); see Andrews v. Nicholson, 421 F.3d 1278, 1283 (Fed. Cir. 2005). But where a claimant is represented by an attorney, the Board is "entitled to assume that the arguments presented by [the claimant are] limited for whatever reason under the advice of counsel and that those were the theories upon which [s]he intended to rely." See Massie v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 123, 131 (2011) (citing Cogburn v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 205, 213 (2010)). Thus, a CUE motion filed by an attorney is not entitled to a sympathetic reading. See id. 

For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that the Veteran's CUE Motion, as filed by his attorney-representative, fails to satisfy the pleading requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(vii)(A) and (B). Motions that are not pleaded with specificity "shall be dismissed without prejudice to refiling." Canady v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 393, 400 (2006); see also 38 C.F.R. § 20.1404(b) (same, as applied to Board CUE motions).

In the opening paragraph of his CUE Motion, the Veteran asserts that he is "entitled to a total rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs of one hundred (100%) beginning on August 18, 1978, to the present . . . ." CUE Motion, page 1. He later states, "the original rating of zero percent (0%) for service-connected schizophrenia in 1978 was totally and completely erroneous." CUE Motion, page 5. In his conclusion, he says, "[w]e request modification of the original rating decision for schizophrenia." CUE Motion, page 13. The Veteran, through his attorney-representative, submitted a supplemental argument on September 27, 2022, and reasserted his arguments from his CUE Motion.

At no point in his CUE Motion or supplemental argument did the Veteran identify the date of the rating decision he to sought revise. And the Board cannot reasonably interpret his CUE Motion as identifying a particular decision because he conflates numerous basic facts, and his arguments are unclear. When referencing the assigned rating, the Veteran says he received a "0%" initial rating. That is factually inaccurate. He received an initial 30 percent rating. He only received a noncompensable rating afterwards, in 1982. He was subsequently denied an increased rating in 1997 and 2014. Thus, it is unclear what rating decision he seeks to revise, as he cited a "0%" rating but discusses it in context of his initial application for service connection. Does he want the 1980, 1982, 1997, 2014, or 2020 rating decision revised? The Board cannot tell. 

Second, he asserts that he should have 100 percent disability rating from 1978, which raises its own issues. If the Board were to revise only the initially assigned rating, it would not necessarily address an effective date for additional ratings. This is to say, addressing CUE within the 1980 rating decision would not implicate later rating decisions, which awarded or denied higher ratings. And the Veteran's CUE Motion discusses facts that are in reference only to information from approximate to 1978. This adds further uncertainty to his CUE Motion, making it more complicated for the Board to discern which rating decision he is seeking to revise. The overall failure to identify the specific rating decision he seeks to revise requires the Board to dismiss his CUE Motion. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(vii)(A).

Beyond the failure to identify the particular rating decision he seeks to revise, his CUE Motion does not identify "clearly and specifically the alleged clear and unmistakable error, or errors, of fact or law in the prior decision." 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(vii)(B). His CUE Motion contains general citations to law regarding CUE, including regulations and caselaw, which may or may not be applicable. He then discusses general facts of record. But the Board has difficulty understanding how he is applying the law to the facts. Several pages of his CUE Motion are just discussions of cases and general legal principles. See generally CUE Motion, pages 6?11. Furthermore, a large portion of the Veteran's CUE Motion is just a disagreement with how the VA Regional Office interpreted (i.e., weighed) the evidence, asserting the VA Regional Office ignored evidence. But such arguments do not support revision based on CUE. See Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313?14 (1992) (mere disagreement with the decisionmaker's rational weighing of the competing evidence does not support a CUE motion). To note, the confusing nature of his arguments are compounded by his underlying inaccurate factual premise, that he received an initial noncompensable disability rating. In short, the Board finds the Veteran's CUE Motion is not sufficiently pleaded, such that it identifies a clear and specific error of fact or law. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(vii)(B).

In sum, the Board finds the Veteran's CUE Motion does not meet the specific filing requirements found in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(vii). He has not identified the actual rating decision he seeks to revise, nor has he clearly and specifically alleged a clear and unmistakable error(s) of fact or law. These deficiencies require the Board to dismiss the CUE Motion without prejudice. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(vii)(A), (B); Canady, 20 Vet. App. at 400.
