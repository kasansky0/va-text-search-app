DOCKET NO. 231010-382657
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of August 30, 2000, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

REMANDED

From August 30, 2000, entitlement to an increased initial rating for PTSD is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On August 30, 2000, the Veteran filed an informal compensation claim for PTSD.  

2. An August 2002 rating decision denied service connection for PTSD.  The Veteran appealed that decision, and a Statement of the Case (SOC) was issued in January 2003.  Although the Veteran did not perfect this appeal, new and material evidence was constructively received between August 2002 and March 2003.

3. The Veteran's PTSD claim was readjudicated in May 2005, March 2009, and October 2009.  However, these decisions did not address whether the evidence constructively received between August 2002 and March 2003 was new and material.

4. From August 30, 2000, the Veteran was entitled to service connection for PTSD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of August 30, 2000, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for PTSD are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.151, 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1970 to November 1971, including service in the Republic of Vietnam.

In September 2023, an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) granted entitlement to service connection for PTSD and assigned an initial 100 percent rating effective July 6, 2023.  The Veteran timely requested Higher-Level Review of the assigned effective date of service connection, and after his request for an earlier effective date was denied, he filed a timely Notice of Disagreement (NOD) and requested a hearing before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).   

In March 2025, the Veteran and his daughter testified at a virtual hearing before the undersigned.  Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the Veteran was notified of the decision that awarded service connection for PTSD, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at or within 90 days of the Board hearing.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the AOJ issued the decision awarding service connection for PTSD and before the Board hearing was held, or evidence submitted more than 90 days after the Board hearing.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.  At the hearing, the Veteran waived the 90-day post-hearing evidence submission period.  See Hearing Transcript at 2.

1. Entitlement to an effective date of August 30, 2000, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for PTSD is granted.

Through his representative, the Veteran asserts that he is entitled to an effective date of service connection relating back to his original claim filed in 2000.  See, e.g., Board Hearing Transcript.  The Board agrees.

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection shall be the later of the date of receipt of the application or the date that the entitlement to the benefit arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

VA's modernized appeals system governs appeals where an original decision was issued on or after February 19, 2019.  VA's legacy appeals system controls in appeals not governed by the modernized system.  While this appeal is governed by VA's modernized appeals system, the procedures applicable to VA's legacy appeals system are relevant in assessing the finality of decisions issued prior to February 19, 2019.  

Under VA's legacy appeals system, a decision is final unless it is timely appealed or unless new and material evidence is received within the time to appeal the decision.  If new and material evidence is actually or constructively received within the time to appeal a decision, then that evidence will be considered in connection with the pending claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  A veteran's VA treatment records are considered constructively received as of the date that they are generated.  See Lang. v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  

New evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decision makers.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).  Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with the previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.  Id.

After an initial decision is issued in VA's legacy system, an appellant typically has one year to file an NOD.  Once an appellant files a timely NOD, VA will issue an SOC, and an appellant can then perfect an appeal by filing a timely substantive appeal.  An appellant typically must file a substantive appeal within 60 days from the date that an SOC is issued, or within one year from the date of notification of the decision on appeal, whichever is later.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.302 (as in effect prior to February 19, 2019).  If a timely appeal is not initiated, or if an appellant does not perfect an appeal, then the initial decision becomes final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (as in effect prior to February 19, 2019).

On March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary of VA, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sep. 25, 2014).  Current VA regulations require a NOD to be filed on VA's prescribed form.  Prior to March 24, 2015, VA did not require the use of a standardized form to file an NOD.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.201 (2012) (NOD does not require special wording); Palmer v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 434, 437 (2007) ("VA has always been, and will continue to be, liberal in determining what constitutes a Notice of Disagreement").

Prior to March 24, 2015, VA allowed for the filing of informal claims without any particular format or requirements aside from (1) an intent to apply for benefits; (2) an identification of the benefits sought; and (3) a communication in writing.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, an application for a formal claim would be sent to the claimant, and if that application was completed within one year of provision to the claimant the date of the informal claim would be used as the date of claim.  A formal claim filed prior to March 24, 2015 was required to identify, at least at a high level of generality, the current condition upon which the Veteran's claim for benefits is based.  See Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

Turning to the evidence of record, the VA received the Veteran's original claim seeking compensation for PTSD on September 21, 2000.  Prior to receiving the Veteran's formal claim, VA received the Veteran's informal compensation claim on August 30, 2000.  See August 2000 Third Party Correspondence.

On August 12, 2002, the Veteran was notified of a rating decision dated August 6, 2002.  That decision listed the evidence that had been considered, including VA treatment records dated from July 10, 2000 to July 28, 2000, and treatment records from a Vet Center dated from July 18, 2000 to October 27, 2001.  See August 2002 Rating Decision at 2.  The decision explained that Vet Center records showed that the Veteran had been diagnosed with PTSD, and the Veteran's DD Form 214 showed that he had served in the Republic of Vietnam.  However, the decision explained that the evidence did not show that the Veteran had served in combat, and the AOJ had been unable to verify the Veteran's report of a fellow servicemember being killed in action.  Accordingly, the AOJ denied service connection for PTSD because the evidence did not show that this disability was incurred in or caused by service.  See id. at 3-4.

The Veteran filed a timely NOD with the August 2002 rating decision.  In December 2002, the AOJ received an operational report for the Veteran's unit.  See Military Personnel Record Received December 16, 2002.  The report reflected that during the reporting period in question, from May 1 to October 31, 1971, two members of the unit were killed in action, seven members of the unit were wounded in action, nine members of the unit were awarded the Purple Heart, and there was one award each of the Bronze Star Medal with "V" device and the Army Commendation Medal with "V" device.  See id. at 3-4.  

In January 2003, the VA issued an SOC.  The SOC reflects that the evidence considered included the evidence considered by the August 2002 rating decision, as well as the unit operation report that had been received in December 2002.  The SOC explained that there were no citations of record showing that the Veteran had served in combat, and records did not show the death of the servicemember that the Veteran had identified or note the Veteran's other stressor.  Accordingly, the AOJ stated that service connection was denied because the evidence did not show that the Veteran had actually participated in combat or experienced or witnessed a traumatic event in service, and as the AOJ could not verify the Veteran's stressor, it was unable to establish a link between PTSD and the Veteran's military service.  See January 2003 SOC at 10.  

The claims file does not reflect that the Veteran filed a timely substantive appeal, or that new and material evidence was actually received within one year of the issuance of the August 2002 rating decision.  However, VA treatment records were constructively received by VA adjudicators within the time to appeal the August 2002 rating decision.  See Lang, supra.  

Specifically, an August 27, 2002 VA Psychology Note reflects that the Veteran spoke about "Vet Center work" and his Vietnam experiences.  An October 8, 2002 VA Psychology Note reflects that the Veteran had been journaling his Vietnam experiences as part of his Vet Center work, and the psychology session revolved around "ventilating various threads" from that history, including the Veteran's increased isolation and alienation after Vietnam, its effects on his marriage and children, the jarring separation upon entry and discharge from the military, the Veteran's ongoing anger rooted in his military experiences, and related topics.  A March 25, 2003 VA Psychology Note reflects that the Veteran had had difficulty starting a treatment relationship with a new Vet Center therapist.  

The VA treatment records above reflect that the Veteran continued to receive treatment at a Vet Center and that these efforts included the production of additional information relevant to the Veteran's stressors while serving in Vietnam, and subsequent emotional impact related to these stressors.  Indeed, of record is a journal reflecting the Veteran's thoughts on his service in Vietnam.  See July 2023 Correspondence.  Although the journal entries are undated, they reflect that the Veteran's experiences in Vietnam occurred "31 years ago."  See July 2023 Correspondence at 9.  As the Veteran served in the Vietnam until 1971, this journal entry would have been created in 2002, and this is consistent with the journal work referenced in the October 8, 2002 VA Psychology Note.  The Veteran's journal reflects additional details regarding stressors while serving in Vietnam, including stressors that occurred shortly after the Veteran's arrival in Vietnam and prior to May 1, 1971.  See, e.g., July 2023 Correspondence at 9, 12-15.

The VA treatment records discussed above, as well as Vet Center records referenced by the VA treatment records, included information that was relevant to VA's efforts to verify a PTSD stressor.  Thus, these records constituted new and material evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).  Moreover, these records were constructively received by VA adjudicators upon generation.  See Lang, supra.  Thus, as new and material evidence was constructively received within one year of the August 2002 rating decision, and after the January 2003 SOC, the August 2002 rating decision did not become final.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran had appealed the August 2002 rating decision, and that VA issued an SOC in January 2003.  However, the SOC and subsequent VA adjudications did not determine whether the VA treatment and Vet Center records discussed above were new and material evidence.  As noted above, the January 2003 SOC did not consider any VA treatment records generated after July 2000, or Vet Center records generated after October 2001.  Moreover, a May 2005 rating decision that found that no new and material evidence had been received only considered VA treatment records received between October 2003 and February 2005.  See May 2005 Rating Decision at 2.  Likewise, while March 2009 and October 2009 rating decisions confirmed and continued the denial of service connection for PTSD on the merits, these decisions did not address whether the VA treatment records and Vet Center records discussed above constituted new and material evidence.  Indeed, they did not consider this evidence at all.  See March 2009 Rating Decision at 1-2 (did not consider VA treatment records); October 2009 Rating Decision at 1-2 (considering VA treatment records from July 8, 2009 to August 26, 2009).  

The present appeal is analogous to the situation in Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  In Beraud, a 1985 rating decision denied service connection for a headache disorder because available records did not show a chronic headache disorder.  Prior to issuing the 1985 rating decision, the AOJ notified the Veteran that it was having difficulty finding his service medical records and requested that the Veteran identify his reserve units so VA could obtain records from them.  After the AOJ issued the 1985 rating decision, the AOJ received the Veteran's response indicating the location of his service records.  However, the AOJ did not act on this letter. 

In 1990, the AOJ reopened the claim but denied it on the merits without referring to the Veteran's 1985 letter.  In 1992 and 2002, the Veteran asked to reopen his claim, and these requests were denied due to a lack of new and material evidence.  However, none of these decisions addressed the Veteran's response received after the 1985 rating decision was issued.  

The Veteran was ultimately awarded service connection for a headache disorder effective from 2004.  He appealed and sought an effective date of service connection retroactive to the claim denied in 1985, arguing that his initial claim was not final because VA never determined whether the medical records referred to in the Veteran's 1985 letter constituted new and material evidence.  The Board denied an earlier effective date and the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) affirmed the Board decision.  The CAVC held that the subsequent final adjudication of a claim, which is identical to a pending that has not been finally adjudicated, terminates the pending status of the earlier claim.  Thus, the CAVC explained, even if the Veteran's initial claim remained pending because VA had not made the required § 3.156(b) determination, the 1990 adjudication nevertheless terminated the pendency of that claim.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the CAVC, holding that "VA was under an express regulatory obligation to make a determination regarding the character of the new evidence [the Veteran] submitted and has, to this day, not done so."  Beraud, 766 F.3d at 1406.  The Federal Circuit also rejected the government's assertion that the CAVC was correct to "presume that the VA considered all relevant evidence, including the medical records [the Veteran] identified in his December 1985 letter, when it made its 1990 Decision.  Though such a general presumption applies where the record before the VA is complete and there is no statutory or regulatory obligation that would be thwarted by application of the presumption, in Bond [v. Shinseki, 659 F.3 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011)] we unambiguously rejected that pre-presumption in circumstances, like here, where there is no indication that the VA made its required determination under § 3.156(b)."  Beraud, 766 F.3d at 1406-07 (citing to Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011)).  

Here, as in Beraud, the AOJ subsequently adjudicated the merits of the claim, but never addressed whether the evidence received within one year of the original denial was new and material.  Moreover, here as in Beraud, VA still has not obtained the Vet Center records referenced in the VA treatment records from August 2002, October 2002, and March 2003.  And as explained above, based on review of the journal referenced in these notes and prepared in connection with the Veteran's Vet Center work, we know that the outstanding Vet Center records would have constituted new and material evidence.  

In sum, the Veteran's original claim for PTSD never became final, as VA treatment and Vet Center records were new and material evidence that was constructively received during the time to appeal that decision.  Although the claim was readjudicated on the merits in 2009, these decisions did not determine whether the VA treatment and Vet Center records were new and material.  Thus, as the Veteran's original claim has not been subject to a final denial, the applicable date of claim here is August 30, 2000.

The final question before the Board is when the Veteran's entitlement to service connection for PTSD arose.  In this regard, the evidence shows that the Veteran likely had PTSD in August 2000, as a November 17, 2000 Vet Center Treatment Note states that the Veteran had the full range of PTSD symptoms and as a July 2000 VA treatment note reflected clinical features suggestive of PTSD.  See July 10, 2000 VA Psychiatry Note.  

Additionally, the Board acknowledges that the July 2023 VA-contracted psychologist linked the Veteran's PTSD to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, and the liberalizing law permitting service connection for PTSD on this basis was not enacted until 2010.  See Ortiz v. McDonough, 6 F.4th 1267 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  However, official service department records confirm that members of the Veteran's unit were killed during his service in Vietnam, and this is credible supporting evidence that the Veteran's claimed stressor of a fellow servicemember's death occurred.  See Military Personnel Records Received December 16, 2002.  Thus, the Veteran's entitlement to service connection for PTSD arose as of his date of claim, August 30, 2000.

An effective date is not warranted prior to August 30, 2000.  The Veteran does not assert, and the evidence does not show, that the Veteran filed a formal or informal claim for VA compensation prior to August 30, 2000.  

Accordingly, the criteria for entitlement to an effective date of August 30, 2000, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for PTSD are met.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. From August 30, 2000, entitlement to an increased initial rating for PTSD is remanded.

The AOJ has not yet addressed the Veteran's initial rating for PTSD from August 30, 2000.  Accordingly, remand is necessary to ensure compliance with 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a) and afford the Veteran an initial AOJ decision as to his initial PTSD rating during this period.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a) (all questions in a matter are subject to one review on appeal).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

After implementing the Board's award of an earlier effective date of service connection for PTSD, adjudicate the Veteran's initial rating for PTSD from August 30, 2000.
