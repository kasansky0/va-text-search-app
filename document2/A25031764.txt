DOCKET NO. 211020-192825
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to a rating in excess of 30 percent for service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder with alcohol and cannabis use disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On February 3, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received written correspondence from the Veteran requesting "complete withdrawal of the Notice of Disagreement" in his claims file.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal as to a rating in excess of 30 percent for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2009 to June 2009, June 2009 to March 2010 and from June 2010 to June 2011, to include service in Iraq/Kuwait.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) thanks the Veteran for his service to our country.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a May 2021 Higher-Level Review decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In his October 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.

In the present case, in February 3, 2025, written correspondence, prior to the promulgation of a decision in this appeal, the Veteran withdrew his appeal and indicated that "[t]his is a complete withdrawal of the Notice of Disagreement" and identified his VA claims file number (the correspondence included the Veteran's name and VA file number).  He stated that, while awaiting his hearing, he received a 100 percent rating for his PTSD.  Review of the record shows that the only Notice of Disagreement in the Veteran's claims file is this appeal challenging the propriety of the reduction in the rating assigned for PTSD.  Therefore, the Board finds the criteria for a withdrawal of this appeal have been met.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Hence, with respect to this claim there remains no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
