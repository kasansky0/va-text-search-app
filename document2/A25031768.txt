ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right hip condition is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for left hip condition is denied.

FINDING OF FACT 

1. The probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran's right hip condition had its onset in service or is otherwise etiologically related to service. 

2. The probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran's left hip condition had its onset in service or is otherwise etiologically related to service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right hip condition have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left hip condition have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1997 to April 2007.

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In the July 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § §1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right hip condition is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left hip condition is denied. 

The Veteran contends that her bilateral hip condition is related to her active military service. Specifically, the Veteran asserts that her bilateral hip condition began in-service, which caused her to be "seen multiple times in medical" for hip pain, swelling, and popping, and has continued since service. See December 2021 VA Form 21-4138. The Veteran also reported that her bilateral hip condition started in the 2000s due to physical training requirements, carrying heavy weapons and gear, and performing heavy impact duties, which took a toll on her hips. See May 2022 C&P Exam: DBQ at 3.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has been diagnosed with bilateral hip strain, the condition was not noted in service with attributable continuity of symptomatology or otherwise shown to be related to her active-duty service. 

In relevant part, 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a) requires that the VA give "due consideration" to "all pertinent medical and lay evidence" in evaluating a claim to disability or death benefits. Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a "medical professional." Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2007). In fact, competent medical evidence is not necessarily required when the determinative issue involves either medical etiology or a medical diagnosis. Id. at 1376-77; see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible. See Layno, supra (distinguishing between competency ("a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered") and credibility ("a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted"). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

As an initial matter, the May 2022 rating decision conceded that the Veteran has a current diagnosis for bilateral hip strain. No clear and unmistakable error has been shown by the evidence of record to rebut this favorable finding. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Accordingly, the first Shedden element is satisfied. 

Here, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for a bilateral hip condition. On the August 1997 entrance exam, the Veteran's lower extremities were noted as normal. See January 2022 DPRIS Response at 14; May 2022 STR - Exam - Entrance at 1. Notably, an August 1999 medical pre-op record (for an unrelated condition) noted that the Veteran had low pelvic pain. See April 2007 STR - Medical at 92 (106 pg.). 

An April 2020 medical record noted that the Veteran had good range of motion in the hips. See January 2022 CAPRI at 317.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in April 2022. The Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral hip strain. See April 2022 C&P Exam: DBQ at 3. As noted above, the Veteran reported that her bilateral hip condition started in the 2000s, while in service, and has worsened since service. Id. The examiner noted that an in-person examination and records review were conducted prior to rendering the medical opinion. See April 2022 C&P Exam: Medical Opinion at 1. The examiner found that the Veteran's bilateral hip condition was less likely than not incurred in or otherwise related to service. Id. at 2. Specifically, the examiner noted that the STRs are silent for any diagnosis, management, or treatment for the Veteran's bilateral hip condition. Id. Further, the examiner noted, "[a] lthough there is a note dated 21st Aug. 1999 for a pre-op condition which she was evaluated for "persistent daily nausea, vomiting with lower abdominal pain in 5/99, she was diagnosed with IBS by G.I. and a pelvic sonography was performed which showed a RV ---NML thin EMS, R&L also WNL and fluid loculations in post cul-de-sac". This is an indication the provider who was evaluating her was ruling out lower pelvic neoplasm, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, adnexal mass and there is no indication for hip or injury to the hip." Id. Accordingly, the examiner found that a nexus could not be established based on the evidence of record. Id. The Board finds this opinion to be adequate for adjudication purposes and affords it great probative value as it is based on correct facts to reach a reasoned conclusion, with full explanation. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. At 304 (2008) ("It is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes probative value to a medical opinion.").  

Although competent to report her symptoms, the Veteran is not competent to link her current bilateral hip disability, shown over 15 years after active service, to her period of active service as the etiology is not susceptible to lay observation and is a complex medical question that requires medical knowledge and training. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Therefore, her medical opinion has no probative value. The Veteran has not presented a competent, favorable medical opinion to weigh in this matter.

The Board assigns greater probative value to the normal STRs. Also, the Board assigns greater probative value to the many years intervening service and the first reports of hip pain and medical diagnosis for bilateral hip disability as well as the VA medical opinion of record. The Veteran did not provide a favorable medical opinion linking her conditions to in-service injury or disease.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
