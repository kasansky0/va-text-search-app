FINDING OF FACT

The evidence fails to show that the Veteran has a diagnosis of a bilateral eye condition, including diabetic retinopathy. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral eye condition, to include diabetic retinopathy, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran honorably served in the United States Army from July 1978 to July 1981. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from November 2021 and March 2022 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decisions issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

Historically, in a July 2021 rating decision the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability and assigned a 10 percent rating while denying the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee and diabetic retinopathy disabilities. In an August 2021 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, and headache disabilities. In October 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher Level Review (HLR), seeking review of the July 2021 and August 2021 adjudications. In the November 2021 HLR rating decision on appeal, the AOJ considered the evidence at the time of the July 2021 and August 2021 decisions and continued the Veteran's 10 percent rating for his lumbar spine disability and denials of service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, and diabetic retinopathy. The AOJ also found in the November 2021 rating decision that duty to assist errors had occurred in the development of the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee and headache disabilities. In the March 2022 decision on appeal, the AOJ adjudicated the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee and headache disabilities in the supplemental claim lane and denied them on the merits. 

In his May 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Thus, when adjudicating the Veteran's 10 percent rating for his lumbar spine disability and denials of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II and diabetic retinopathy, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2021 and August 2021 AOJ decisions, which were subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the July 2021 and August 2021 decisions which were subsequently subject to HLR, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. When adjudicating the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee and headache disabilities, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the March 2022 decision cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim adjudicated herein, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. However, because the Board is remanding the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, headaches, bilateral knee disabilities, and a rating in excess of 10 percent for his lumbar spine disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the evidence of record in conjunction with this case. However, it has limited its discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008). Thus, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim on appeal.

Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral eye condition, to include diabetic retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for diabetic retinopathy (defined as the retinal changes associated with diabetes mellitus). See August 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Compensation; September 2020 VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Application for Compensation; October 2021 VA Form 20-0996, Request for HLR. 

Although the Veteran's claim is for a specific eye disability, the Board has sympathetically construed his claim to include a general claim of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral eye condition. See Hodge v. West, 155 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (holding that VA must sympathetically read pleadings); Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009) (holding the scope of the Veteran's claim includes any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record). As such, it will holistically evaluate the record in consideration of same. 

Nonetheless, the existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation, and after a careful analysis of the Veteran's claims file, the Board finds that it fails to show that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a bilateral eye condition, including diabetic retinopathy, such that he may be entitled to service connection on any basis during the period on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; see Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315-1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Ward v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 233 (2019); Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary). 

A thorough review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show that the Veteran reported of pain and lumps in his upper eyelids and was diagnosed with conjunctivitis in October 1980. See June 2015 STRs. In November 1980, the Veteran reported drainage from both eyes, and upon examination, he was found to have redness along his lower lid, a bilateral infection of his conjunctiva (conjunctivitis), and was prescribed a medication to treat bacterial infections. A careful analysis of the Veteran's remaining STRs, including a March 1981 Report of Medical History, a March 1981 Report of Medical Examination, and an April 1982 Report of Medical History do not contain reports of, treatment for, or diagnoses of bilateral eye or diabetic retinopathy disabilities. Id. 

A careful analysis of the Veteran's post-service VA and private treatment records reveals no evidence of treatment, symptoms, or diagnoses associated with a bilateral eye or diabetic retinopathy disability. See September 2020, October 2020, December 2020, and June 2021 CAPRIs; April 2020 and October 2020 Medical Treatment Records-Non-Government Facility.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2020. See December 2020 Eye Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). During the examination, the Veteran reported blurriness and the use of over the counter eye drops. Further review of the examination report reveals no diagnoses of any eye disabilities, including diabetic retinopathy. After physical examination of the Veteran, the examiner opined that the Veteran did not have any eye diagnoses at the time of the examination. See December 2020 Medical Opinion DBQ. 

The Board has carefully and sympathetically reviewed the Veteran's claims file. However, the evidence fails to show that the Veteran has current diagnosis of a bilateral eye or diabetic retinopathy disability during the appeal period. In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection. Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). The requirement that a current disability be present is satisfied "when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim...even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim." McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); see also Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013). In so finding, the Board finds the Veteran's VA and private treatment records, together with the findings of the December 2020 examiner, to be the most probative evidence that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a bilateral eye or diabetic retinopathy disability during the appeal period. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511-12 (1995).

In denying the Veteran's claim for compensation, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay statements that he currently has a bilateral eye or diabetic retinopathy disability. Although the Veteran is competent to report the symptoms of these conditions, the diagnosis of these complex disabilities requires clinical testing and medical expertise and cannot simply be diagnosed by lay observation alone; and the Veteran is not considered competent (meaning medically qualified by training or experience) to diagnose a bilateral eye or diabetic retinopathy disability. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). His lay statements are thus of less probative weight than his medical treatment records and the findings of the December 2020 VA examiner discussed above. Caluza, 7 Vet. App. 511-12.

As the evidence of record fails to show that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a bilateral eye or diabetic retinopathy disability during the period on appeal, there is thus no doubt herein to resolve, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (reasonable doubt to be resolved in Veteran's favor); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (the benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies if the competing evidence is in approximate balance).  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Remand is necessary in this case to ensure that due process is followed and that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claims so that he is afforded every possible consideration. 38?U.S.C. §?5103; 38?C.F.R. §?3.159. Here, the basis for remand concerns pre-decisional errors arising from VA's duty to assist. 38?C.F.R. §?20.802.

1. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, to include as secondary to service-connected disabilities with obesity as an intermediate step, is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for diabetes mellitus type II and contends that it is caused by or aggravated by his service connected disabilities, including obesity as an intermediate step. See August 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Compensation (Veteran claims diabetes mellitus type II as secondary to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); October 2021 VA Form 20-0996, Request for HLR (Veteran claims diabetes mellitus, type II, as secondary to service connected disabilities with obesity as an intermediate step). 

The Veteran has been afforded numerous VA medical opinions. The November 2020 medical opinion fails to address the aggravation prong of the Veteran's secondary service connection claim. See November 2020 C&P Exam (November 2020 Medical Opinion DBQ). Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74, 91 (2018) (to be adequate, the medical opinion must provide explanations for both the aggravation and causation prongs of a secondary service connection claim). Similarly, a June 2021 medical opinion also fails to address aggravation and moreover, the rationale is based upon general medical literature and not the specific facts of the Veteran's claim. See June 2021 Medical Opinion DBQ. Atencio, 30 Vet. App. at 91; Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 54, 60 (2018) (holding that a medical opinion stating only that there is nothing in the medical literature supporting an association between a disability and a Veteran's military service is inadequate as a matter of law). Lastly, August 2021 medical opinions are based on general medical literature articles and not the facts of the Veteran's case, fail to address aggravation, and do not speak to whether obesity was an intermediate step between the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II, and his service-connected disabilities. See August 2021 Medical Opinion DBQ. Thus, all of the medical opinions regarding the claim are inadequate for adjudication. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008) (requiring the Board to ensure that medical opinions are made on the basis of sufficient facts or data and the application of reliable medical principles).

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type II. Affording the Veteran an adequate medical opinion has a reasonable possibility of substantiating his claim for benefits, particularly as to the causal relationship between his diabetes mellitus, type II and his service-connected disabilities. The Board therefore finds that the AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion regarding the claim prior to the August 2021 rating decision is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

2. Entitlement to service connection for headaches, to include as secondary to service-connected tinnitus, is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for headaches and contends that they arise from his active service and also are caused by or aggravated by his service-connected tinnitus. See August 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Compensation; June 2021VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Application for Compensation; June 2021 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim. The record shows that the Veteran has diagnoses of both tension and migraine headaches during the period on appeal; as such, it has expanded his claim to be that of a general headache disability. See August 2021 Headaches DBQ; Clemons, 23 Vet. App. at 5. 

The Board has carefully reviewed the medical opinions regarding the Veteran's headache disabilities and finds that they are inadequate. The January 2021 and July 2021 medical opinions regarding direct service connection are based upon an absence of documentation in and after service. See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992) (the absence of documented treatment in service or thereafter is not fatal to a service connection claim); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336, n. 1 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (noting that a VA examiner's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the Veteran's] disability such that his claim for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence"); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991) (the relevant inquiry is whether there was continuity of symptomatology, not continuity of treatment). The June 2021 medical opinion fails to address the aggravation prong of the Veteran's secondary service connection claim. Atencio, 30 Vet. App. at 91. The December 2021 medical opinion regarding aggravation is based upon an inaccurate factual premise. See Ward v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 233 (2019) (secondary service connection is warranted for any incremental increase in disability, meaning any additional impairment of earning capacity above the degree of disability existing before the increase, in a nonservice-connected disability resulting from a service-connected disability, regardless of its permanence). Thus, all of the medical opinions regarding the claim are inadequate for adjudication. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 302.

The Veteran has current diagnoses of headache disabilities. Affording the Veteran an adequate medical opinion has a reasonable possibility of substantiating his claim for benefits, particularly as to the causal relationship between his headaches, his active-duty service, and his service connected tinnitus. The Board therefore finds that the AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion regarding the claim prior to the March 2022 rating decision is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

3. Entitlement to service connection for left knee strain is remanded.

4. Entitlement to service connection for right knee strain is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral knee disabilities and contends that they are directly related to his active-duty service and are caused by or aggravated by his service connected bilateral pes planus. See August 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Compensation; June 2021VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Application for Compensation; June 2021 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim. 

The Board has carefully reviewed the medical opinions regarding the Veteran's bilateral knee strain disabilities and finds that they are inadequate. The January 2021 medical opinion regarding direct service connection is based upon an absence of documentation in and after service. See Ledford, 3 Vet. App. at 89; Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1336, n. 1; Wilson, 2 Vet. App. at 19. June 2021 and December 2021 medical opinions regarding secondary service connection fail to address aggravation. See June 2021 and December 2021 C&P Exams (June 2021 and December 2021 Medical Opinion DBQs); Atencio, 30 Vet. App. at 91. Thus, all of the medical opinions regarding the claim are inadequate for adjudication. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 302.

The Veteran has current diagnoses of bilateral knee strain disabilities. See June 2021 Knee and Lower Leg Conditions DBQ. Affording the Veteran an adequate medical opinion has a reasonable possibility of substantiating his claim for benefits, particularly as to the causal relationship between his bilateral knee disabilities, his active-duty service, and his service-connected bilateral pes planus. The Board therefore finds that the AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion regarding the claim prior to the March 2022 rating decision is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

5. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess 10 percent for lumbar spine disability is remanded.

The Veteran seeks a rating in excess of 10 percent for his lumbar spine disability and contends that it is more severe than currently rated due to his severe flare-ups of pain, use of a cane, and difficulties with balance. See June 2021VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim; October 2021 VA Form 20-0996, Request for HLR (Brief attached thereto). 

A thorough analysis of the Veteran's VA and private treatment records shows that he used physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioid medication, a topical analgesic, and electrical stimulation via a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit to treat his lumbar spine disability during the period on appeal. See September 2020, October 2020, December 2020, June 2021 CAPRIs; April 2020 and October 2020 Medical Treatment Records-Non-Government Facility; June 2021 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) DBQ. 

In Jones v. Shinseki, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that "the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria." 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). More specifically, "if [a Diagnostic Code] does not specifically contemplate the effects of medication, the Board is required... to discount the ameliorative effects of medication." McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) (en banc) (citing Jones, 26 Vet. App. at 63). 

The Court has recently stated that when the Board adjudicates an increased rating claim for a musculoskeletal disability under a diagnostic code which does not contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication, it must consider the beneficial effects of the medication on the severity of the Veterans disability, including an evaluation of the baseline of the veteran's disability and whether it may be more severe than rated without medication. Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, at *18, 19. Prior to the Court's March 2025 decision in Ingram, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his lumbar spine disability in June 2021. See June 2021 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) DBQ. Although the Veteran reported taking medications to treat his lumbar spine disability, the ameliorative effects of same on the severity his lumbar spine disability were not considered or discussed the June 2021 examiner. There are no other VA examinations which consider same within the applicable evidentiary window. 

The Board cannot make, on its own, a medical determination as to the ameliorative effects that the Veteran's medications may have on his lumbar spine disability. See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991) (stating that the Board cannot make its own, independent medical judgments). Accordingly, the findings of the June 2021 VA examiner require clarification. Affording the Veteran a VA medical opinion which expounds upon the findings of the June 2021 VA examiner has a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim, particularly as to the severity of his lumbar spine disability without the ameliorative effects of medication. Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, at *18, 19. The Board therefore finds that the evidence of record was inadequate at the time of the August 2021 rating decision, requiring remand. See 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a). 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Forward the Veteran's claims file for addendum opinions regarding the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II, bilateral knee strains, and headache disabilities. The need for a physical examination is left to the discretion of the medical professional offering the addendum opinions. The entire claims file must be made available to, and be reviewed by, the VA examiner. 

The medical professional should provide an opinion to the following:

(a.) Whether the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II, was caused by any of his service-connected disabilities?

(b.) Whether the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II, was aggravated by any of his service-connected disabilities?

(c.) Is the Veteran obese? Please explain why or why not? 

(d.) If the answer to (c) is yes, whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities caused him to become obese or aggravated his obesity?

(e.) If the answer to (d) is yes, whether the Veteran's obesity was a substantial factor in causing his diabetes mellitus, type II?

(f.) If the answer to (e) is yes, whether the Veteran's diabetes, type II, would not have occurred but for obesity that was caused by or aggravated by his service-connected disabilities?

(g.) Whether the Veteran's headache disabilities were incurred in or are otherwise related to the Veteran's active-duty service? 

(h.) Whether the Veteran's headache disabilities were caused by the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus disability?

(i.) Whether the Veteran's headache disabilities were aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus disability?

(j.) Whether the Veteran's right knee strain was incurred in or is otherwise related to the Veteran's active-duty service? 

(k.) Whether the Veteran's right knee strain was caused by the Veteran's service-connected bilateral pes planus?

(l.) Whether the Veteran's right knee strain was aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected bilateral pes planus?

(m.) Whether the Veteran's left knee strain was incurred in or is otherwise related to the Veteran's active-duty service? 

(n.) Whether the Veteran's left knee strain was caused by the Veteran's service-connected bilateral pes planus?

(o.) Whether the Veteran's left knee strain was aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected bilateral pes planus?

A medical opinion is adequate if it is based upon consideration of the Veteran's prior medical history and describes the Veteran's condition in sufficient detail so as to allow the Board to make a fully informed evaluation. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?120, 124 (2007); see also Ardison v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?405, 407 (1994). This requires the opinion to "contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two." Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295, 301 (2008). Additionally, a medical opinion is inadequate where its rationale is based solely on medical literature and not facts specific to the individual Veteran. See Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30?Vet. App.?54, 60 (2018).

The examiner is also reminded that the medical opinion must provide explanations for both the aggravation and causation prongs of a secondary service connection claim to be adequate for the Board's adjudication purposes. Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74 (2018). Additionally, secondary service connection is warranted for any incremental increase in disability, meaning any additional impairment of earning capacity above the degree of disability existing before the increase, in a nonservice-connected disability resulting from a service-connected disability, regardless of its permanence. See Ward v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 233 (2019). 

The examiner is cautioned that the absence of documented treatment in service or thereafter is not fatal to a service connection claim, and the absence of evidence in the service treatment records is an insufficient basis, by itself, for a negative opinion. See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). The Board also notes that the absence of documented treatment, in and of itself, is not a basis for discrediting the Veteran's lay statements of continuity. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In this regard, the relevant inquiry is whether there was continuity of symptomatology, not continuity of treatment. See Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991).

Lastly, the examiner is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions rendered. If the examiner is unable to offer the requested opinion, it is essential that the examiner offer a rationale for the conclusion that an opinion cannot be provided without resort to speculation, together with a statement as to whether there is additional evidence that might enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge. See Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 390 (2010).

2. Forward the Veteran's claims file for an addendum opinion regarding the Veteran's lumbar spine disability. The need for a physical examination is left to the discretion of the medical professional offering the addendum opinion. The entire claims file must be made available to, and be reviewed by, the VA examiner.

The medical professional should provide an opinion to the following:

(a.) Consider and discuss if the Veteran's lumbar spine disability would be more severe if it is untreated by medication. Please explain why or why not? 

(b.) Consider and discuss what the baseline of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability would be when the beneficial effects of medication are discounted, i.e., what is the severity of his disability without medication?

(c.) Consider and discuss if, without the beneficial effects of medication whether the Veteran would experience the functional equivalent of ankylosis i.e., functional loss consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis.

The examiner should provide range of motion estimations for flexion, extension, right and left lateral, and right and left rotation movements based on a review of all procurable information - to include the Veteran's statement on examination, case-specific evidence (to include medical treatment records when applicable and lay evidence), and the examiner's medical expertise. 

Additionally, the examiner should address the Veteran's private and VA treatment records showing that he used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioid medication, a topical analgesic to treat his lumbar spine disability and his lay statements that he has flare-ups of severe pain where he has to use a cane and difficulties with balance. See September 2020, October 2020, December 2020, June 2021 CAPRIs; April 2020 and October 2020 Medical Treatment Records -Non-Government Facility; June 2021 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) DBQ; June 2021 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim.

The examiner is reminded that a medical opinion is adequate if it is based upon consideration of the Veteran's prior medical history and describes the Veteran's condition in sufficient detail so as to allow the Board to make a fully informed evaluation. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?120, 124 (2007); see also Ardison v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?405, 407 (1994). This requires the opinion to "contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two." Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295, 301 (2008).

If the examiner is unable to offer the requested opinion, it is essential that the examiner offer a rationale for the conclusion that an opinion cannot be provided without resort to speculation, together with a statement as to whether there is additional evidence that might enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge. See Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 390 (2010).
