DOCKET NO. 210202-177919
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided by the appellant on December 26, 2018, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved the appellant's claim for payment of the cost of medical services provided to the Veteran on December 26, 2018.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided by the appellant on December 26, 2018, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.?38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1996 to October 1998.

The appellant is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished medical services to the Veteran on December 26, 2018.

This matter is on appeal before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2019 decision of a VA Veterans Health Administration (VHA) AOJ. In February 2021, the Board received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Evidence Submission docket.

The appellant's claim for payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided to the Veteran on December 26, 2018, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.?In an August 2021 letter, the AOJ advised the appellant that the December 26, 2018, episode of care was approved under 38 U.S.C. § 1725, after secondary review.?The letter explained that the claims related to this episode of care would be processed according to VA policy and the appellant will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) for each claim paid.

The administrative action for the entire December 26, 2018, episode of care at issue in this appeal constitutes a reversal of the prior denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal. No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.?38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d).
