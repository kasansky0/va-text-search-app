ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for a low back condition is denied.

Entitlement to a rating of 10 percent for residuals of pilonidal cyst removal, to include scar, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's thoracolumbar spine disability is characterized by limitation of flexion between 30 and 60 degrees, including during flare-ups.

2. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the scar associated with the Veteran's service-connected residuals of pilonidal cyst removal is painful.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for a low back condition have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a.

2. The criteria for a 10 percent rating, and no higher, for residuals of pilonidal cyst removal, to include scar, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army from January 1997 to May 1999.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 Regional Office (RO) rating decision.

In the VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claims on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. While the Board typically considers only those factors outside the specific rating criteria when appropriate in order to best determine the level of occupational and social impairment.  See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002); Massey v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 204, 208 (1994).

When there is a question as to which of two separate evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria required for that particular rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Nevertheless, in cases where the Veteran's claim arises from a disagreement with the initial evaluation following the grant of service connection, the Board shall consider the entire period of claim to see if the evidence warrants the assignment of different ratings for different periods of time during these claims a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for low back condition.

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his service connected low back condition.

The Veteran's low back disability is rated as 20 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. §4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242. Under the applicable rating criteria:

A 30 percent rating requires a showing of forward flexion of the cervical spine 15 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine.

A 40 percent rating requires a showing of forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

A 50 percent rating requires a showing of unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

A 100 percent rating requires unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.

Objective neurological abnormalities are to be rated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code. Id., Note (1). The record does not confirm a present diagnosis of any neurological complications associated with the Veteran's low back condition, and therefore such ratings are not granted.

An alternate method for rating spine disabilities rates based on incapacitating episodes due to intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS). DC 5243. As no such pathology is found in the record, the Board will not  further consider that rating criteria.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted.

In December 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for his lumbar spine. The Veteran reported that his low back pain has progressively worsened over the years. He reported flare-ups of the back that occur daily and are described as severe. Further, he reported that the pain radiates into his hips and that he has treated the low back condition with steroid injections, physical therapy, chiropractors, acupuncture and cupping. The Veteran also reported that he must take frequent breaks at work and must leave early in order to avoid traffic because he is unable to sit for prolonged periods due to the functional impact of his low back condition.

On examination, the Veteran exhibited forward flexion to 40 degrees and extension to 10 degrees. The examiner noted no evidence of crepitus although he noted pain with active motion that causes a decreased range of motion. During repetitive use testing, the examiner noted flexion to 35 degrees and extension to 5 degrees. On flare-ups, the examiner noted flexion to 40 degrees and extension to 10 degrees. No additional factors impacting the Veterans low back condition were indicated or noted. Moreover, the examiner noted full muscle strength, no atrophy, normal reflexes, normal sensation, no ankylosis, and no IVDS.

In light of this evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's low back condition has not manifested to such a degree as to warrant a rating in excess of the 20 percent already assigned. In this regard, the Veteran has not been shown to have forward flexion of the cervical spine of 15 degrees or less, forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 30 degrees or less. Neither has he shown any evidence of ankylosis. This conclusion includes consideration of the medical evidence of record, as well as the Veteran's own reports of severity of his symptoms.

In sum, the Board finds that the Veteran's low back condition has not manifested to such a significant degree as to warrant a rating in excess of 20 percent. Therefore, the claim is denied.

2. Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 0 percent for residuals of pilonidal cyst removal, to include scar.

The Veteran is pursuing a compensable initial rating for residuals of pilonidal cyst removal, to include scar, under DC 7805.

Scars are evaluated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes (DCs) 7800- 7805.  DC 7805 provides that scars should be evaluated pursuant to DCs 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804 and adds that any disabling effect(s) not considered in those rating criteria should be evaluated under an appropriate code.

Under DC 7804, one or two scars that are unstable or painful warrant a 10 percent evaluation. Three or four scars that are unstable or painful warrant a 20 percent evaluation. There is no specific requirement of pain on objective examination. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804.  

The Board finds that an initial 10 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's residuals of pilonidal cyst removal, to include scar, because it is painful.  

During a December 2023 VA examination for scars/disfigurement, the Veteran was diagnosed with residuals of pilonidal cyst removal, to include scar. The Veteran reported the onset of the condition began in 1997 while stationed in South Korea. The Veteran stated that he underwent a surgical procedure on his tailbone while on active duty that never healed properly. As a result, he reports intermittent drainage, discharge and pain, especially following prolonged sitting. 

Although the VA examiner noted no pain during examination, the Board finds the Veteran's testimony credible and competent in this regard, and a 10 percent rating is assigned since the grant of service connection, as the scar rating criteria applicable in this case do not include a specific requirement of pain on objective examination. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804. A higher rating of 20 percent is not warranted as there is no evidence that the scar is also unstable, or that more than one scar is service-connected.

The Board has considered whether a rating in excess of 10 percent is warranted, but finds that it is not according to regulations.

Diagnostic Code 7800 is inapplicable as the scar is not located on the Veteran's face, head or neck. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7806. Diagnostic Code 7801 is also not applicable as the Veteran's scar is not shown to be deep and it is less than 12 square inches (77 sq. cm).  The December 2023 examination report shows the Veteran's scar is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Diagnostic code 7802 does not provide for ratings higher than 10 percent, which the Veteran already has.  Finally, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's scar produces any further limitation of function or disabling effects. See DC 7805.

A 10 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted since the grant of service connection.
