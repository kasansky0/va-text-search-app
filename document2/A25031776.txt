DOCKET NO. 240725-476223
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

1.  The Veteran has been diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

2.  The Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents at Fort McLellan.

3. The medical evidence supports a relationship between paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the herbicide agent exposure.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1981 to July 1984.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) via a July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  The Veteran indicated that he was disagreeing with the denial of claims for service connection for diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities, erectile dysfunction, and heart condition.  In February 2025, the Board, adjudicating these claims in response to a different VA Form 10182 and therefore in a case with a different docket number, remanded claims for entitlement to service connection for diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities, and erectile dysfunction.  Given that these claims are now in remand status, the Board will not address them here.  The Board will address the remaining claim for service connection for a heart disability, which was denied in a July 2024 rating decision. 

In the July 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service incurrence of a disease or injury; and (3) a relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The Veteran claims he has a heart disability due to exposure to herbicide agents at Fort McLellan.

The February 2022 VA disability benefits questionnaire contains a diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  The current disability requirement has thus been met.

Veterans who served in various locations are presumed exposed to herbicide agents and certain diseases are presumed service connection in veterans exposed to herbicide agents.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1116, 1116A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Fort McLellan is not one of the locations and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is not one of the diseases noted above.  However, the availability of service connection on a presumptive basis does not preclude consideration of service connection on a direct basis.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

A February 2023 Brief submitted by the Veteran's representative includes a private report by an environmental scientist who opined that solders located on Fort McClellan were exposed to herbicide agents.  In Gust v. McDonough, No. 21-1317, 2023 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 115, *10-11 (Jan. 26, 2023) (mem dec) (Toth, J.), the Court reversed a Board decision denying service connection due to direct exposure to herbicide agents at Fort McLellan after the time period during which herbicide agent use was conceded, based on the Board's failure to consider all of the evidence of herbicide agent exposure including competent lay statements and multiple studies.  The Board finds the reasoning of this decision persuasive. Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).  Consequently, the in-service injury requirement has been met with evidence of exposure to herbicide agents at Fort McLellan.

The remaining question is whether the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is related to the herbicide agent exposure.  There is only one medical opinion on this question, that of the February 2022 VA examiner.  The examiner concluded that a nexus had not been established because there was no evidence of herbicide agent exposure.  The opinion can be read to support the corollary proposition that, had herbicide agent exposure been shown, then a nexus would have been established.  Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record). Thus, as herbicide agent exposure has been shown, the opinion supports a relationship between the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the herbicide agent exposure at Fort McLellan.

For the above reasons, the evidence supports that the Veteran's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is related to herbicide agent exposure at Fort McLellan.  Entitlement to service connection for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is therefore warranted.
