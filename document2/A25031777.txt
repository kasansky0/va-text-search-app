REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 2007 to November 2007 and from June 2008 to June 2009, including service in Iraq during the Persian Gulf War.  Her military occupational specialty (MOS) was Chemical Operations Specialist, and her awards and decorations include the Iraq Campaign Medal with Campaign Star.  She meets the definition of a "Persian Gulf Veteran" as specified by 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and her service constitutes presumptive toxic exposure per 38 U.S.C. § 1119.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from two April 2021 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The appeal as to a skin disability, to include seborrheic dermatitis, stems from an April 2021 VA form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim, and the other matters stem from a December 2020 VA form 21-526EZ.

In August 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) framework, electing the hearing docket by the Board.  

The Veteran was afforded a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) in February 2025.  

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the notification of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  As the transcript of the February 2025 hearing reflects, at the proceeding the Veteran requested that the 90-day post hearing period be waived.  Thus, the Board will proceed to adjudicate this appeal.

Favorable findings identified in the April 2021 rating decision denying service connection for a skin disability, seborrheic dermatitis, scalp, which are binding on the Board, include that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability inasmuch as a VA treatment record, dated in November 2020, shows diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis, scalp.  

Favorable findings identified in the April 2021 rating decision denying service connection for the other conditions include, as to left and right ankle disability and GERD, the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service; as to IBS, there is current diagnosis of IBS in VA treatment records, and as to menstrual disorder there were no favorable findings.  

Preliminary Matters-Representation

With regard to representation, although the Veteran elected to go forward at her February 2025 Board hearing without a representative, a VA form 21-22a was filed in December 2020 and signed by the Veteran and attorney Jan Dils.  Another VA form 21-22a was filed, signed by the Veteran and attorney Jan Dils, in July 2022.  

In July 2024, prior to the Board hearing, but after the appeal was docketed at the Board and the Veteran was informed of the docketing, the Veteran's attorney sent a letter to the VA stating, "Please accept this letter as formal notification that I am withdrawing as the attorney or record for the above-named claimant."  This letter was signed by attorney Jan Dils.  Thus, the Veteran's representative attempted to withdraw as the Veteran's VA representative in this letter.  The letter does not reflect that a copy was sent to the Veteran.

VA regulation state that after an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals has been filed, a representative may not withdraw services as representative in the appeal unless good cause is shown on motion.  38 C.F.R. § 20.6.  

In the July 2024 letter, the Veteran's attorney provided no reason in support of her motion to withdraw from representation, much less a reason that would meet the definition of good cause.  Upon consideration of the attorney's letter, and pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.6, the Board must find that good cause has not been shown as to why representation should be withdrawn.  Therefore, the attorney's attempt to withdraw representation of this Veteran is denied.  

However, at the February 2025 Board hearing, the undersigned discussed this matter with the Veteran.  The Veteran stated she wished to proceed unrepresented.  Thus, the attorney is no longer the Veteran's VA representative because the Veteran has chosen to terminate the relationship and proceed pro se.

Service Connection

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability).  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); see 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).

Even in the absence of a diagnosed disability, evidence of functional limitations due to symptoms can meet this requirement.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Specifically, in Saunders v. Wilkie, the Federal Circuit found that the term "disability," as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110, refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability, and held that pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability.  To establish the presence of a disability pursuant to Saunders, there must be competent evidence specific to the claimant tending to show that his or her impairment rises to a level to affect earning capacity, which may include showing manifestations of a similar severity, frequency, and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person.  Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8, 17 (2020).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107.  

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.  To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must persuasively stand against a finding that the evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "[w]hether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue to be addressed by the Board").  

The Board is charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence. Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).  Indeed, in Jefferson v. Principi, 271 F.3d 1072 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), citing its decision in Madden, recognized that that Board had inherent fact-finding ability.  Id. at 1076; see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a) (West 2002). Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to weigh and assess the evidence. Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 488-89 (2000); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614, 618 (1992).  

As a finder of fact, when considering whether lay evidence is satisfactory, the Board may also properly consider internal inconsistency of the statements, facial plausibility, consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the Veteran, and the Veteran's demeanor when testifying at a hearing.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 38 (2007); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  

Here, all three elements of service connection are established by the competent and credible lay and medical evidence of record as to the left and right ankle disability, IBS, GERD and a skin disorder diagnosed as seborrheic dermatitis.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Service connection for IBS is granted.

2. Service connection for GERD is granted.

The Veteran urges her IBS and GERD began in service when she was in the Persian Gulf, as symptoms began at that time.  Alternately she feels they are due to other service-connected disabilities to include PTSD.

Because the veteran served in the Southwest Asia Theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, service connection may also be established under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  Under that section, service connection may be warranted for a Persian Gulf veteran who exhibits objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability that became manifest during active military, naval or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, or to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than not later than December 31, 2026.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(1).

For purposes of 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, there are three types of qualifying chronic disabilities: (1) an undiagnosed illness; (2) a medically unexplained chronic multi symptom illness; and (3) a diagnosed illness that the Secretary determines in regulations prescribed under 38 U.S.C. § 1117 (d) warrants a presumption of service connection.

A medically unexplained chronic multi symptom illnesses is one defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms, and specifically includes chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and functional gastrointestinal disorder, which specifically includes irritable bowel syndrome.

After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for IBS and GERD.  The evidence shows that the Veteran has been diagnosed with IBS and GERD.  See, e.g., VA treatment records dating in September 2016, February 2021 and April 2021 showing diagnosis of IBS and GERD.  Also, as to IBS, the April 2021 rating decision notes the IBS diagnosis.

March 2021 VA examinations reflect the examiner's opinion that neither GERD nor a bowel condition are related to service.  They did not find IBS but rather constipation, but the Board notes the record does show IBS.  

The Veteran has testified that her symptoms associated with both of these conditions, bloating, uncontrollable gas, constipation and bowel issues as to IBS, and recurrent upper GI gas, heartburn and abdominal pain as to GERD, began while she was in Iraq.  See February 2025 hearing testimony.  

The Board finds the Veteran's reports of gastrointestinal and bowel symptomatology during and since service to be credible.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  While the Veteran is not competent to diagnose IBS or GERD, or their etiology, she is competent to describe symptoms during and since service, and although there is not any appreciable information about IBS or GERD in the service treatment records (STRs), the Board is satisfied that the Veteran has sufficiently described that the problems began to bother her while she was in service and particularly in Iraq.

Thus, the Veteran's bowel symptoms, which began in service, have been attributed to irritable bowel syndrome, a disability for which presumptive service connection is warranted.  

Further, the Veteran's gastrointestinal symptoms, which began in service have been attributed to GERD.  Her credible testimony as to onset and the ongoing nature of lay observable symptoms is at least as probative as the VA negative medical opinion.  The evidence is, at worst, evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's current GERD symptoms had their onset during service. See Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) (noting that "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a) (Service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces).

In light of the foregoing, and after resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for IBS and GERD is warranted. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

3. Service connection for right ankle disability manifested by pain and limited motion is granted.

4. Service connection for left ankle disability manifested by pain and limited motion is granted.

The Veteran contends that she has bilateral ankle disabilities that began in service when she injured her ankles doing rigorous training activities and then in Iraq performing her duties.  The problem, manifested by pain and swelling and limited motion, has persisted to the present.  

She alternatively maintains that her ankle problems may be due to her service-connected back, knee, plantar fasciitis and fibromyalgia.

STRs reflect one instance in which the Veteran complained of swollen ankles; she was placed on profile and returned to duty.  

VA examination in March 2021 yielded no diagnosis of ankle disability.  Bilateral X-rays were normal and there was no soft tissue injury noted.  

At the Board hearing, the Veteran credibly testified as to ongoing bilateral ankle pain, swelling and limited motion since service.  She noted she tried really hard to keep up physically in basic training, as it was the expectation to build a cohesive unit.  She would run on uneven terrain with the others, but this caused pain in her ankles.  When in theater, she would have to jump in and out of tactical vehicles a lot and this contributed to worsening the ankle pain and symptoms.  The problems continued after service.  She has pain taking a flight of stairs or descending.  She uses Ace bandages to wrap the ankles and applies Ben Gay.  She had crutches given to her at the VA because of ankle problems.  She has tried exercises to alleviate the pain, but unfortunately, this has not worked.  It started in service, and it has been a problem ever since.

While the VA examination found no ankle condition, even in the absence of a diagnosed disability, evidence of functional limitations due to symptoms can meet this requirement.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Specifically, in Saunders v. Wilkie, the Federal Circuit found that the term "disability," as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110, refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability, and held that pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability.  

To establish the presence of a disability pursuant to Saunders, there must be competent evidence specific to the claimant tending to show that his or her impairment rises to a level to affect earning capacity, which may include showing manifestations of a similar severity, frequency, and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person.  Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8, 17 (2020).

The Board finds functional impairment of earning capacity is demonstrated as to both ankles.  The credible testimony as to lay-observable symptoms of pain, swelling and limited motion in daily life establish impairment of a similar severity, frequency, and duration as those noted at Diagnostic Code 5271, Ankle, Limited Motion of.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5271.  

The February 2025 testimony constituted competent and credible evidence that she has current left and right ankle disability that began during service and have been recurrent since that time.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The evidence is, at worst, evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's current left and right leg shin splints had their onset during service.  See Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) (noting that "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a) (Service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces).

In light of the foregoing, and after resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for left and right ankle disabilities manifested by pain, swelling and limited motion is warranted. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Service connection for a skin disability, seborrheic dermatitis, scalp (claimed as dermatitis of scalp) is granted.

There is current disability as noted in the rating decision on appeal, with November 2020 records showing diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis, scalp.

The Veteran testified that she began to have skin problems on her scalp when deployed to Kuwait and Iraq, and they have continued to the present time.  She first thought it was severe dandruff, since in the desert she did not get the opportunity to wash her hair often, and it became greasy.  Her scalp became irritated.  Sometimes she had to go two weeks without a day off and thus did not wash her hair.  There was extreme grease, sand and other matter that would get into her hair and skin and irritate her scalp.  She explained the importance of personnel being on duty running a FOB to watch the detainees.  So, there were times that she lost the day off, and could not wash her hair as much as would have been customary.  The sandstorms made it worse.  When she returned from overseas, she tried to treat her scalp, but the problems persisted.  She saw that matter was sitting on her hair and she went to a doctor at VA who told her the issue could be linked to problems with her entire body.  

The February 2025 testimony constituted competent and credible evidence that the current skin disability, seborrheic dermatitis, scalp (claimed as dermatitis of scalp) began during service in Iraq and Kuwait during the Gulf War and has been recurrent since that time.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The evidence is, at worst, evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's current seborrheic dermatitis, scalp had its onset during service.  See Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) (noting that "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a) (Service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces).

In light of the foregoing, and after resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for seborrheic dermatitis, scalp is warranted. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service connection for a menstrual disorder is remanded.

The Veteran urges that she has menstrual problems that were not present prior to her service in Iraq and Kuwait that she believes are due to toxic exposure in those areas.  

Although STRs did not indicate a menstrual disorder, she reported she went on birth control while deployed because she knew historically, she could have heavy menstruation and did not want that to happen overseas.  When she returned from deployment and went off birth control, she had severe painful and recurring menstrual problems that have continued.  She has been going to gynecology providers at VA to try and deal with the problem but does not know exactly what the problem is at this point.  

After the April 2021 rating decision on appeal was issued, in August 2022, the SFC Hearth Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act, Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 ("PACT Act")) was passed.  Under the PACT Act, VA is required to provide a disability examination and medical nexus opinion when a veteran submits a compensation claim and has evidence of a disability and participation in a TERA, but the evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) (see PACT Act, Sec. 303).  That provision provides, in pertinent part:

(a)(1) Medical examinations and medical opinions.-Except as provided in subsection (b), if a veteran submits to the Secretary a claim for compensation for a service-connected disability under section 1110 of this title with evidence of a disability and evidence of participation in a toxic exposure risk activity [TERA] during active military, naval, air, or space service, and such evidence is not sufficient to establish a service connection for the disability, the Secretary shall-

(A) provide the veteran with a medical examination under section 5103A(d) of this title; and

(B) obtain a medical opinion (to be requested by the Secretary in connection with the medical examination under subparagraph (A)) as to whether it is at least as likely as not that there is a nexus between the disability and the toxic exposure risk activity [TERA].

Id. (emphasis added).

The PACT Act defines a TERA to mean "any activity- (i) that requires a corresponding entry in an exposure tracking record system (as defined in section 1119(c) of this title) for the veteran who carried out the activity; or (ii) that the Secretary determines qualifies for purposes of this subsection when taking into account what is reasonably prudent to protect the health of veterans."

Also, after the April 2021 rating decision on appeal was issued, a May 2023 TERA memorandum was added to the file.  

The PACT Act is implicated as to the menstrual disorder claim, as highlighted in the candid testimony as to onset of symptoms and TERA.

The May 2023 TERA memo notes TERAs include her service in Southwest Asia, as well as her service related to her MOS as Chemical Ops Specialist.  

38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) requires VA examination and a nexus opinion regarding whether any current menstrual disorder is etiologically related service to include TERAs established in the VA TERA memo.

It is relevant to note that under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a), (2) when providing the Secretary with a medical opinion under paragraph (1)(B) for a veteran, the health care provider shall consider (A) the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran; and (B) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 1168.

In light of the above, specifically given the May 2023 TERA memo and the Veteran's testimony in February 2025, the RO must consider the merits of the menstrual disorder claim on this basis.  See Green v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 127 (2024) ("The Board also has the discretion to "remand for correction of any other error by the [AOJ] in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim." 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a))." 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to obtain examination and medical opinion to determine the nature, onset, and etiology of any current menstrual disorder.  

All findings should be reported in detail.

The Veteran's lay statements and testimony should be acknowledged and discussed, to include her report that she had these problems when she got back from her Southwest Asia deployment and got off birth control, and they have continued.

The clinician is asked to address the following:

Please opine as to the likelihood that any current menstrual disorder had its onset in or is otherwise etiologically related to an in-service event, injury, or disease, specifically to include TERA.  

As to TERA, the VA clinician must consider the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs involving the Veteran.  

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for their opinion in the examination report.

If any of the above requested opinions cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner must state this and provide a rationale for such conclusion.
