CONCLUSION OF LAW

The retroactive payment of VA compensation benefits for the addition of a dependent child was proper.  38?U.S.C. §§?5110, 5111, 5112; 38?C.F.R. §?3.401.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 2011 to June 2022 with service in Afghanistan.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 notification of additional dependency benefits, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. The retroactive payment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits for an additional dependent was proper; the appeal is denied.

The Veteran asserts that he was underpaid for his dependency claim.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board finds that the retroactive payment for the addition of his second daughter was proper.

The law provides for the rates of disability compensation, and for payment of additional compensation for dependents of veterans who are at least 30?percent disabled.  38?U.S.C. §§?1114 (c), 1115, 1134, 1135.  The Veteran was at all times relevant to this issue rated appropriately to receive additional compensation for dependents.  Further, 38?C.F.R. §?3.401(b) provides that the effective date for payment due to a claimant based on dependency shall be the latest of: (1) the "date of claim"; (2) the date dependency arises; (3) the effective date of the qualifying disability, so long as evidence of dependency is received by VA within one year of notification of such rating; or (4) the date of commencement of the Veteran's award.  The "date of claim" includes the "date notice is received of the dependent's existence, if evidence is received within one year of VA's request.  Id.; see McColley v. West, 13?Vet. App.?553, 556 (2000).  Under applicable criteria, the effective date of an award of additional compensation for a dependent is the latest of the following dates: (1) The date of claim.  This term means the following, listed in their order of applicability: (i) the date of the veteran's marriage, or birth/adoption of his or her child, if the evidence of the event is received within one year of the event; otherwise, (ii) the date notice is received of dependent's existence, if evidence is received within one year of the VA request; or, (2) The date the dependency arises; or, (3) The effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within one year of notification of such rating action; or, (4) The date of commencement of the veteran's award.  38?U.S.C. §?5110 (f), (n); 38?C.F.R. §?3.401 (b).   

The Veteran was granted service connection for several disabilities and rated 100 percent disabled in June 2022.  He was informed on June 24, 2023, that he was being paid as a single Veteran with no dependents.  He was also informed that because of his disability rating, he was eligible for additional benefits for any dependents and, "We may be able to pay you retroactive benefits for your dependents if you submit your dependency claim within a year from the date of this letter."  The letter included instructions on enrolling his dependents online through eBenefits or submitting VA Form 21-686c, Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents. 

On September 25, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-686c, Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents and provided the required information to add his spouse, C.L.H., and his daughter, G.G.H. to his compensation award.

On September 28, 2023, VA wrote the Veteran and informed him that his spouse and daughter were added to his award and additional payments would begin October 1, 2023.  Accordingly, his October 1, 2023 payment was $4100.40, an increase of $349.83 which reflected the adjustment for his spouse (+$201.94) and his first daughter (+$135.05).

On October 4, 2023, the Veteran submitted another Form 21-686c, Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents and provided the required information to add his other daughter, J.L.H. to his award.

On March 5, 2024, VA wrote the Veteran and told him that J.L.H was added to his award as of October 4, 2023 and he was paid an additional amount for her, effective November 1, 2023.  A retroactive payment in the amount of $410.99 was deposited in the Veteran's account on March 4, 2024 (+$100.34 for an additional child in November 2023 and $103.55 for December 2023, January 2024, and February 2024: $100.34+$103.55+$103.55+$103.55=$410.99).  

As seen above, the Veteran did not inform VA of the existence of his dependents within one year of his service connection grant.  Thus, the earliest date that his spouse and G.G.H. could be added to his award was September 25, 2025, payable on October 1, 2023, which was done.  

Likewise, the earliest date J.L.H. could be added to his award was October 4, 2023, payable November 1, 2023, which was also done.  This action resulted in a retroactive payment in March 2024, which fully paid the Veteran an additional dependent's benefit for the months prior to March 2024 for his second daughter, in the amount of $410.99.

Since the evidence of record weighs persuasively against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  See 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another, is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's claims for additional dependents' benefits were properly adjudicated, and the retroactive pay was correctly calculated.  As such, the appeal is denied.
