ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating of 60 percent, for gastroesophageal reflux disease with hiatal hernia (GERD) is granted, subject to controlling regulations governing the payment of monetary awards.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's GERD symptoms more nearly approximated pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a rating of 60 percent for GERD have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.114, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7399-7346.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In that decision, the AOJ, following a February 2024 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review, assigned an earlier effective date of November 3, 2018, for the award of a 30 percent rating for GERD that was granted in a February 2024 rating decision. Previously, the Veteran filed an October 2021 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application after the AOJ issued an October 2021 rating decision that continued a 10 percent rating. The October 2020 rating decision was issued after the Veteran filed an October 2019 VA 21-526EZ in which he sought service connection for GERD.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an initial rating of 60 percent GERD

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in VA's Rating Schedule. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation; otherwise, the lower evaluation will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). Where, as here, entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 510 (2007). Here, as explained below, the uniform 60 percent rating is proper.

The Veteran's GERD is currently rated 30 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7399-7346. Hyphenated DCs are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional DC to identify the basis for the rating assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. The use of DC 7346 reflects that there was no diagnostic code specifically applicable to the Veteran's service-connected GERD and DC 7346 was specifically applicable to his hiatal hernia.  

Under DC 7346, a 10 percent rating is warranted for hiatal hernia with two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent rating of less severity; a 30 percent rating is warranted for hiatal hernia with persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of a considerable impairment of health; and a 60 percent rating is warranted for hiatal hernia with symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346.

Words such as "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" are not defined in the Rating Schedule, but the Board is finding that there is severe impairment of health, by which it means extremely significant or serious.

During the pendency of the appeal, amendments to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, the Schedule of Ratings for the Digestive System, were enacted, effective May 19, 2024. Under the amended criteria, a new diagnostic code (DC 7206) was added for GERD.  See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: The Digestive System, 89 Fed. Reg. 19735 (Mar. 20, 2024).  

Where the rating criteria are amended during the course of the appeal, the Board considers both the former and the current schedular criteria and, should an increased rating be warranted under revised criteria, that award may not be made effective before the effective date of the change. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g); Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). Given that the amendment is effective after the evidence window closed, it cannot be applied without impermissibly having a retroactive effect. Consequently, the Board will apply the former criteria, which in any event are more favorable, as the only rating higher than 60 percent requires a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction of esophageal stricture(s) or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube). There is no evidence of a documented history of esophageal stricture with any of these symptoms.

In an October 2019 statement, the Veteran reported that because of his GERD, he experiences acid reflux, black stool, coughing, heartburn, nausea, painful swallowing, and regurgitation at least once a day along with occasional vomiting. His GERD also makes it difficult to sleep and he has to avoid spicy foods and citrus. He stated that he takes Omeprazole and Prilosec, and has also taken Milk of Magnesia, Pepto Bismol, and Tums.

In an August 2020 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), the clinician noted that the Veteran takes Omeprazole and Tums to treat his symptoms. He noted that the Veteran's symptoms were reflux and regurgitation. The Veteran did not report symptoms of nausea or vomiting, nor unexplained weight loss. The clinician did not note symptoms of dysphagia, melena, or hematochezia. Additionally, no pyrosis, substernal pain, esophageal stricture, spasm of esophagus, or acquired diverticulum of the esophagus was noted. No other pertinent physical findings were noted. In an August 2020 QTC addendum, a clinician provided an opinion regarding the Veteran's obesity. As such, the unexplained weight loss is not indicated. 

In a July 2021 private medical examination, the clinician opined that the Veteran was entitled to a 60 percent rating for GERD. The clinician noted the Veteran's reported symptoms to include heartburn with acid reflux,  regurgitation of stomach contents into his throat, a sore throat with painful swallowing, a feeling like there is a lump in his throat, vomiting, frequent coughing, nighttime choking due to regurgitation, changes in his voice with hoarseness, dark colored stool, and tooth enamel damage from stomach acid going into his mouth every day. The private clinician also noted the Veteran's report that he must avoid certain foods, like spaghetti, hot wings, chili, fast foods, soda, and citrus juice because they worsen his symptoms. He stated that has vitamin deficiencies and must take vitamin supplements. The Veteran stated that he had chest pain when his GERD flares up. 

For the following reasons an increased rating of 60 percent, but no higher, for GERD is warranted.

The Board notes that the Veteran's GERD is controlled by medication to a degree but "the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria." Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). DC 7346 does not contemplate the effects of relief provided by medication.

The Veteran has taken multiple prescription and over the counter medications to treat his GERD through the period on appeal with varying degrees of effectiveness. The Veteran's statement in support of claim as well as examinations reflect that his symptoms worsen when he does not take his medications. Entitlement to a higher rating based on relief provided by medication may not be denied and the Board must discount the ameliorative effects of medication. Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025) (the Board is required "to discount beneficial medication effects when relevant rating criteria do not specifically contemplate medication use").

The Veteran's GERD symptoms have more nearly approximated the criteria for an increased rating of 60 percent. The Veteran reported in his October 2019 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim symptoms to include acid reflux, black stool, coughing, heartburn, nausea, painful swallowing, and regurgitation at least once a day along with occasional vomiting. Additionally, the July 2021 private clinician noted the Veteran's statements of symptoms to include symptoms to include heartburn with acid reflux, regurgitation, a sore throat with painful swallowing, a feeling like there is a lump in his throat, vomiting, frequent coughing, nighttime choking due to regurgitation, changes in his voice with hoarseness, dark colored stool, vitamin deficiencies, and tooth enamel damage. Under DC 7346, a 60 percent rating is assigned when GERD manifests in symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health; however, severe impairment of health is not specifically denied. The Board finds that the Veteran's GERD symptomatology is frequent and pervasive and, as such, has substantially impacted and impaired his health. Thus, a 60 percent rating for GERD is warranted through the appeal period. This is the maximum schedular rating allowed under DC 7346. 

DC 7346 specifically applies to the Veteran's hiatal hernia, but in any event, there is no potentially applicable diagnostic code under which a higher rating would be warranted for GERD. 

For the above reasons, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the symptoms and impairment caused by the Veteran's GERD more nearly approximate the criteria for a 60 percent rating under the former criteria. As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to an increased rating of 60 percent for GERD is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Board has considered the Veteran's claim and decided entitlement based on the evidence. Neither the Veteran nor his attorney have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with respect to his claim. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
