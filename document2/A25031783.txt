DOCKET NO. 240312-423855
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to whether readjudication of service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is warranted is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In February 2024, while the current appeal was pending, a rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO) granted service connection for generalized anxiety disorder with insomnia.  The grant encompasses all of the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms, including depressed mood and anxiety, and is therefore a full grant of the benefit sought.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There remains no case or controversy with respect to the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for mixed anxiety and depressed mood over which the Board may exercise jurisdiction.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.103, 20.104. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1996 to April 2020.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  

In a March 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran elected Direct Review.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

Prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal that continued the denial of service connection for adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood, the RO issued a rating decision in February 2024 which granted service connection for anxiety with insomnia.  The grant of service connection includes the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms of depressed mood and anxiety.  See February 2024 rating decision.  As such, the Veteran's appeal for entitlement to service connection for adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood is moot, as the benefits sought on appeal have already been fully granted.  Because there remains no case or controversy concerning whether the Veteran is entitled to the benefit sought, the appeal with respect to the claims for service connection for adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5).
