2. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for hypertension by the appellant (or the appellant's authorized representative) have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

3. The criteria for service connection for OSA, to include as secondary to service-connected acquired psychiatric disability, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2001 to October 2006. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2021 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the June 23, 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on December 2, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. The appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

In an April 2025 Board decision, the Board granted service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder.

At the December 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that a grant of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and/or depressive disorder, would satisfy that issue on appeal. See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993).

Given that the Veteran's above claim has been granted in full, the Board determines that there is no case and controversy in regard to this claim before the Board. As such, there remains no specific error of fact or law for the Board to consider. The claim is therefore dismissed. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

2. The appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for hypertension. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. In the present case, the appellant's authorized representative has withdrawn the appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for hypertension and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. See November 2024 VA Form 20-10208. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal on this issue and it is dismissed.

Service Connection

Under applicable law, service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999). Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

A lay witness is competent to testify as to the occurrence of an in-service injury or incident where such issue is factual in nature. Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993).  In some cases, lay evidence will also be competent and credible on the issues of diagnosis and etiology. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Specifically, lay evidence may be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis where (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1377; see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  A layperson is competent to identify a medical condition where the condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307 (2007).

Additionally, where symptoms are capable of lay observation, a lay witness is competent to testify to a lack of symptoms prior to service, continuity of symptoms after in-service injury or disease, and receipt of medical treatment for such symptoms. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002).

Additionally, where a veteran served ninety days or more of active service, and certain chronic diseases become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to an acquired psychiatric disability, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression.

The Veteran contends he had sleep apnea symptoms in service. He also contends that his sleep apnea is related to his service-connected acquired psychiatric disability. In support of his claim, the Veteran credibly reported that he started having sleeping problems and loud snoring in service and has continued ever since. See BVA hearing transcript (December 2025).

A June 2019 private treatment note indicates that the Veteran underwent a sleep study that confirmed obstructive sleep apnea. Additionally, he continued his medical treatment for his OSA condition, to include the use of a CPAP machine. Id. Thus, the Veteran meets the current disability requirement.

The Board finds that the Veteran's a competent and credible statements and records show that his OSA is related to service. 

The Board finds that the medical and lay evidence linking the Veteran's OSA condition to service is probative, competent and credible. Additionally, the Veteran has various outpatient treatment records of his OSA disability and treatment. Further, the Board also finds that the competent and credible Veteran's statements show that his OSA problems began during service and have been recurrent since that time.

The Veteran is competent to report his OSA symptoms that began in service and the Board finds the Veteran's statements credible. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2); Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005); Layno. The Board finds that the lay evidence is consistent with other evidence of record, both medical and lay, and further finds that it is competent and credible.

The Board finds that the medical and lay evidence, shows that the Veteran's OSA disability had its onset in service and have been recurrent since that time. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's OSA disability had its onset during his period of military service. As such, service connection is granted. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).
