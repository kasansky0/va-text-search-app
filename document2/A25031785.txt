DOCKET NO. 241217-495366
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for glioblastoma is granted.

?

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's glioblastoma is due to herbicide agent exposure during service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for glioblastoma have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1960 to July 1964 and from July 1966 to December 1967.

The case is on appeal from an October 2024 rating decision.

In a December 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran selected the Hearing option.  

In April 2025, the Veteran testified at a Board hearing.

During the hearing, the Veteran waived the 90-day evidence submission window following the date of the hearing.  Therefore, the Board has considered the evidence of record at the time of the October 2024 rating decision.

The October 2024 rating decision included a finding that new and relevant evidence had been received.  The Board is bound by this favorable determination and will therefore address the case on the merits.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service connection for glioblastoma.

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  A veteran seeking compensation under these provisions must establish three elements: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

Analysis

The Veteran contends that his glioblastoma is due to herbicide agent exposure during service.  See August 2024 appellate brief.  

The Veteran has been diagnosed with glioblastoma.  See May 2024 VA examination.  A November 1966 service personnel record (SPR) indicates the Veteran served in the Republic of Vietnam during a period when herbicide agent exposure is presumed.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii).  Additionally, during the April 2025 hearing, the Veteran testified credibly that he was present in Da Nang, Vietnam, during service and witnessed the use of herbicide agents.  Accordingly, a current disability and in-service incurrence have been established. 

Regarding nexus, glioblastoma is not among the list of diseases presumptively associated with herbicide agent exposure.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).  However, service connection may still be established on a direct basis through competent medical evidence.  

In June 2024, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's glioblastoma is not related to service.  Significantly, the examiner's opinion was premised on a belief that the Veteran had not been exposed to herbicide agents during service.  In September 2024, the examiner restated the same opinion, again emphasizing that the Veteran had not been exposed to herbicide agents.

In October 2024, the same VA examiner provided a new opinion which conceded the Veteran's in-service herbicide agent exposure but again concluded the Veteran's glioblastoma is not related to service.  The examiner stated that a "claim for service connection for glioblastoma due to Agent Orange exposure requires a clear and compelling demonstration that the veteran's condition is a direct result of this exposure," and that "scientific literature does not definitively establish a causal relationship between Agent Orange exposure and the development of glioblastoma."  

The Veteran also submitted a March 2024 private medical opinion.   The private examiner reviewed the Veteran's treatment records and restated excerpts from relevant medical literature before concluding that the Veteran's glioblastoma is "at least as likely as not caused by" his in-service herbicide agent exposure.  The examiner explained that the herbicide agent dioxin has been classified as a human carcinogen and that epidemiological studies have found an increased incidence of brain cancer after dioxin exposure.  

After reviewing the foregoing opinions, the Board finds the March 2024 private opinion is most probative of the etiology of the Veteran's disability.  See Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 (1998) (when faced with conflicting medical opinions, the Board may favor one medical opinion over another).

The June 2024 and September 2024 VA opinions, which erroneously state the Veteran was not exposed to herbicide agents during service, are inadequate.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. 460, 461 (1993) (an opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value).  The October 2024 VA opinion included a persuasive explanation but contained no citations to specific medical literature that support its conclusion.  Additionally, the statement that "a clear and compelling demonstration" of medical causation is required suggests the examiner misunderstood VA's evidentiary standard for causation.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Conversely, the March 2024 private opinion included a cogent explanation, discussed pertinent medical literature, and applied the correct standard of proof for causation.  The Board thus finds the March 2024 opinion deserving of greater evidentiary weight.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008).  

Therefore, the Board finds, under the specific facts and circumstances of this case, the Veteran's glioblastoma is due to herbicide agent exposure during service.  This is particularly so when reasonable doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Accordingly, service connection for glioblastoma is warranted.
