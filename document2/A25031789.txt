From September 15, 2021, but not earlier, an evaluation of 50 percent, for service-connected migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, is granted. 

From August 15, 1998, but not earlier, entitlement to service connection for migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, is reconsidered.

From August 15, 1998, but not earlier, entitlement to service connection for migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, to include as secondary to service-connected sinusitis, is granted.

From May 1, 2021, but not earlier, entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to a service-connected disability (TDIU) is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation, prior to September 15, 2021, for service-connected migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claim of entitlement to service-connection for eczema was received on January 19, 2021, within one year of receipt of a January 11, 2021, intent to file.

2. The evidence shows that, from September 15, 2021, the Veteran's migraines disability has caused very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

3. Relevant military personnel records were associated with the claims record after a January 19, 1999, rating decision that originally denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for migraines.

4. The most probative and persuasive evidence demonstrates that, from August 15, 1998, it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, is a result of the Veteran's service or service-connected disability.

5. From May 1, 2021, the Veteran's service-connected disability renders him unable to maintain gainful employment.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to January 11, 2021, for service-connected eczema have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400, 4.3.

2. From September 15, 2021, the criteria for an evaluation of 50 percent, for service-connected migraines, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

3. Since relevant military personnel records were associated with the claims record after a January 19, 1999, rating decision that originally denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for migraines, reconsideration of the Veteran's claim, from August 18, 1998, is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c).

4. From August 18, 1998, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, to include as secondary to service-connected sinusitis, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310, 4.3.

5. From May 1, 2021, the criteria for entitlement to a TDIU, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.3, 4.7, 4.15, 4.16, 4.18, 4.19.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marines from July 1988 to July 1992 and May 1995 to August 1998.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from July 29, 2023, and December 18, 2023, higher-lever review Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) of the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  The July 29, 2023, higher-level review rating decision granted a 30 percent evaluation for service-connected migraines from September 15, 2021, a 50 percent evaluation for service-connected migraines from September 12, 2022, and TDIU from September 12, 2022.  The December 18, 2023, higher-level review rating decision granted service-connection for eczema with an initial 10 percent evaluation from January 11, 2021.

On December 30, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), requesting the Board's direct review docket.  Accordingly, based on the Veteran's selection of the direct review docket, as to the July 29, 2023, higher-level review rating decision on appeal, the Board is limited to review of the evidence in the record through and until the date of a March 21, 2023, rating decision that ruled upon a migraines early effective date supplemental claim, granting a 30 percent evaluation for service-connected migraines from September 12, 2022, and ruled upon an original TDIU claim, denying it.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.301, 3.2500, 3.2501, 3.2601.  Also, based on the Veteran's selection of the direct review docket, as to the December 18, 2023, higher-lever review rating decision, the Board is limited to review of the evidence in the record through and until the date of an August 19, 2022, supplemental claim rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for eczema.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.301, 3.2500, 3.2501, 3.2601.

Preliminary note

The Board notes that the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for eczema, which was denied in the August 19, 2022, supplemental claim rating decision, was originally denied in a February 26, 2021, rating decision.  The August 19, 2022, supplemental claim rating decision readjudicated the eczema service connection claim after concluding, upon higher-level review, that additional development was necessary due to a duty to assist error.  The August 19, 2022, supplemental claim rating decision denied service connection for eczema; and the December 18, 2023, higher-level review rating decision on appeal granted service-connection for eczema with an initial 10 percent evaluation from January 11, 2021.  In light of the AOJ's determination to readjudicate the Veteran's claim, the Board need not discuss the threshold matter of whether new and relevant evidence has been received by VA meriting readjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 11, 2021, for service-connected eczema is denied.

The Veteran claims entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of his eczema service connection claim.

Earlier Effective Date

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on a claim of service connection and a claim reopened after final adjudication "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). 

The implementing regulation clarifies this to mean that the effective date of service connection and compensation based on a reopened claim, as is the case here, will be the "[d]ate of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later."  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Before February 19, 2019, 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 explained the manner and methods in which a claim could be initiated and filed, to include an intent to file a claim.  After February 19, 2019, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 were amended; specifically, the provisions pertaining to an intent to file a claim were not applied to supplemental claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A supplemental claim is any complete claim for a VA benefit where an initial or supplemental claim for the same or similar benefit on the same or similar basis was previously decided.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(2).

However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) in the case of Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (MVA) decided that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 that excluded supplemental claims from the intent to file framework were invalid.  MVA, 7 F.4th at 1147.  Essentially, the Federal Circuit explained that it saw no basis to treat supplemental claims differently than other types of claims, for which the intent to file framework did apply, so its exclusion was arbitrary and capricious.  Id.

"If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary ... appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received."  38 CFR 3.155(b).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a), the modernized review system, also known as the AMA, is applicable to all claims or requests for reopening finally decided claims for which VA issues notice of a decision on or after the effective date of the AMA.  The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.  38 C.F.R. § 19.2(a).

Under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the notice of a decision was issued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, continuous pursuit can be established by filing a supplemental claim, higher-level review request or VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 2.500(c)(1).  Following notice of a decision on a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 2.500(c)(2).

On January 11, 2021, VA received an intent to file a claim of entitlement to service connection for eczema.  See VA letter, January 12, 2021.  The Veteran filed his eczema service connection claim on January 19, 2021.  The AOJ has already granted the Veteran's eczema service connection claim from January 11, 2021; that is, from the date of the intent to filed received by VA.  Accordingly, entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 11, 2021, for service-connected eczema is denied.

2. From September 15, 2021, but not earlier, an evaluation of 50 percent, for service-connected migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, is granted.

The Veteran claims entitlement to an initial evaluation higher than 30 percent from September 15, 2021, for his service-connected migraines.

The Board notes that, having been previously denied service connection for migraines in a January 19, 1999, unappealed rating decision, on September 15, 2021, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim application in a VA Form 20-0995 supplemental claim application.  The Veteran had been making attempts to file his supplemental claim since February 2, 2021, using incorrect VA 21-526EZ, fully develop claim forms, with VA repeatedly notifying him about it.  See February 2, 2021, VA 21-526EZ, fully developed claim form; VA letter, February 26, 2021; July 19, 2021, VA 21-526EZ, fully developed claim form; VA letter, July 23, 2021; VA letter, August 6, 2021; VA letter, August 9, 2021.

Higher initial evaluation

A disability rating is determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or the illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

VA has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable through the assertions and issues raised in the record and to explain the reasons and bases for its conclusions.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 592-593 (1991).  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is generally to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  The critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disabilities is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disability.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability evaluations.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the grant of service connection is required.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings."  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509 (2007). 

The Veteran's migraines are evaluated under Diagnostic Code 8100. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100.  Under Diagnostic Code 8100, a 50 percent rating is warranted with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  A 30 percent rating is warranted with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over last several months.  A 10 percent rating is warranted with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over last several months.  A 0 percent rating is warranted with less frequent attacks.

The rating criteria of Diagnostic Code 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 251-252 (2018).

This renders 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 (higher of two evaluations) and 4.21 (application of rating schedule) inapplicable.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

The rating criteria do not define "prostrating."  By way of reference, the Board notes that according to Webster's New World Dictionary of American English, Third College Edition, "prostration" is defined as "utter physical exhaustion or helplessness."  A very similar definition is found in Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary (31st Ed. 2007), in which "prostration" is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  See Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 251-252.

"Severe economic inadaptability" is also not defined in VA law.  Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445-446 (2004).  In Pierce, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that nothing in DC 8100 requires that the Veteran be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating.  Id.  The Court discussed that consideration must also be given as to whether the disability was capable of producing severe economic inadaptability, regardless of whether the condition was actually causing such inadaptability.  Id. at 446-447.

At the outset, the Board notes that the July 29, 2023, higher-level review rating decision granted a 30 percent evaluation for service-connected migraines from September 15, 2021, and a 50 percent evaluation for service-connected migraines from September 12, 2022.  That is, from September 12, 2022, the Veteran was granted the highest schedular evaluation under Diagnostic Code 8100, which provides that a 50 percent rating is warranted with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100.  Thus, the AOJ's action does not represent a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal.  A.B. v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1992).

In a February 2021 statement, the Veteran reported that the headaches were constant and varied in degree of severity.  He did not have a day where he was not suffering with some degree of pain above and around his eyes.  The pain ranged from moderate to severe.  When severe, he became nauseous, irritable, and light sensitive.  When the pain was moderate, he found it difficult to sleep and completing other daily tasks such as reading or completing chores around the house.

In a March 2021 VA headache examination, the Veteran reported duration of typical head pain from 1-2 days to more than 2 days, location of typical head pain on both sides of the head, and characteristic prostrating attacks of headache pain once every month.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks of headache pain, with symptoms including constant head pain, pulsating or throbbing head pain, pain on both sides of the head, pain worsens with physical activity, when bends over the pressure in the sinuses gets worse.  The VA examiner also noted non-headache symptoms associated with headaches, including "nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, changes in vision (such as scotoma, flashes of light, tunnel vision)."

VA treatment records show, respectively, that the Veteran was admitted to hospital with reported symptoms of having difficulty speaking and feeling weak all over.  Assessment was likely migraine, unlikely TIA.  Neurological consult results dated August 25, 2021, showed an assessment of migraine with aura, single episode of transient neuro deficits, with no evidence of acute ischemia on MRI brain.  See VA treatment records, May and August 2021.

A headache tracker provided by the Veteran in July 2021, shows the severity of his headache pain ranges from a 5-9/10 lasting for a full day.  The most severe headache being recorded on May 10, 2021, which progressed to weakness, confusion and inability to think or speak properly.

In a September 2021 statement, the Veteran reported that on May 10th, 2021, he had been hospitalized for his migraines condition as it presented with transient ischemic attack symptoms.  This was a very terrifying event that prompted him to seek medical intervention for this condition.  As a result of his condition, he had been forced to "put my education on hold until I could get this: problem under control.  I was starting my second clinical placement in Occupational Therapy Assisting when I was hospitalized.  I am happy to report that I am now scheduled to begin my second clinical placement on September 20, 2021.  This condition has become a serious problem and I therefore respectfully request a service-connected disability rating."

Subsequently, in a December 2021 VA headache examination, the VA examiner noted the Veteran's reporting of continuing to experience migraines related headaches that had progressed over time.  The Veteran had symptoms of nausea, sensitivity to light/sound with impact to both sides of head primarily and at times right side only; worsened with activity.  Also, the Veteran endorsed flashes of lights and change of vision.  The Veteran reported headache pain localized on both sides of the head for 1-2 days.  Headache symptoms noted by the VA examiner included pain localized to one side of the head and pain on both sides of the head.  Non-headache symptoms noted by the VA examiner included "nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, changes in vision (such as scotoma, flashes of light, and tunnel vision)."  Also, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran had been hospitalized for severe onset of migraine headache.  The Veteran was diagnosed he believed at this time with complex migraine with deficits.  He stated that during admission he was unable to walk (utilized walker), had cognitive deficits and was unable to speak for a period of time.  Finally, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's headache condition affected his ability to work.  Particularly, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran was a full-time student and had 1-2 weeks work time lost in the last 12 months.  Also, the Veteran's migraine condition impacted his activities of daily living and quality of life.  Further, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran continued to experience migraine related headaches that had progressed over time.  He had symptoms of nausea, sensitivity to light/sound impacting both sides of the head primarily and at times right side only, worsened with activity, including flashes of lights and change of vision.

The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms that he experiences and finds that his statements are credible.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-470 (1994).

As noted above, "severe economic inadaptability" is not defined in VA law.  Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 445-446 (2004).  Also, nothing in DC 8100 requires that the Veteran be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating.  Id.  Further, consideration must also be given as to whether the disability is capable of producing severe economic inadaptability, regardless of whether the condition is actually causing such inadaptability.  Id. at 446-447.

Accordingly, having evaluated the evidence, the Board finds that, during the period of the appeal, the Veteran experienced migraine headaches that manifested in very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks, productive of severe economic inadaptability, corresponding to the criteria for entitlement to a 50 percent evaluation under Diagnostic Code 8100.  Therefore, from September 15, 2021, but not earlier, an evaluation of 50 percent, for service-connected migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, is granted.

3. From August 15, 1998, but not earlier, entitlement to service connection for migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, is reconsidered.

4. From August 15, 1998, but not earlier, entitlement to service connection for migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, to include as secondary to service-connected sinusitis, is granted.

The Veteran claims entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for migraines.

The Veteran separated from service on August 14, 1998.

On August 18, 1998, the Veteran filed his original claim for entitlement to service connection for migraines.

The Veteran was originally denied service connection for migraines in a January 19, 1999, rating decision.  The Veteran was notified of this rating decision on February 3, 1999.  There is no indication that new and material evidence was received within the one year following notification of the January 19, 1999, rating decision that would have been pertinent to the migraines service connection claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  Also, the Veteran did not appeal the January 19, 1999, rating decision as to the AOJ's determination to deny his migraines service connection claim.  38 C.F.R. § 19.52(a).

However, the Board notes that relevant military personnel records were associated with the claims record after the January 19, 1999, rating decision.  See military personnel records, September 24, 2021.

"[A]t any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c).

Since there was receipt of relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when the AOJ first decided the Veteran's claim on January 19, 1999, the Board finds that reconsideration of the claim from its original August 18, 1998, filing date is warranted.  See Blubaugh v. McDonald, 773 F.3d 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2014); George v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 199 (2018).  Accordingly, from August 15, 1998, but not earlier, entitlement to service connection for migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, is reconsidered.

Service connection for the Veterans' migraines was granted as secondary to his service-connected sinusitis, from September 15, 2021.  See January 14, 2022, rating decision.  The Veteran's claim of service connection for sinusitis, for its part, was granted from August 15, 1998; that is, from the day after the date of separation from active service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  See January 19, 1999, rating decision.

In a March 2021 VA headache examination, a VA examiner endorsed the Veteran's diagnosis of migraine including migraine variants since 1998.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's report of migraine headaches along with sinus headaches since he was in service.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed migraine headaches were as likely as not incurred and or caused due to the sinus issues he had during service and still continued to have.

Thus, after due consideration, based on all the foregoing, and giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, from August 15, 1998, but not earlier, entitlement to service connection for migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, to include as secondary to service-connected sinusitis, is granted.

5. From May 1, 2021, but not earlier, entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to a service-connected disability (TDIU) is granted.

The Veteran claim entitlement to an earlier effective date for TDIU.

The July 29, 2023, higher-level review rating decision granted TDIU from September 12, 2022; that is, from the date in which the Veteran filed his VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.

Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, or if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Entitlement to a TDIU also requires that the Veteran show that he was unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment due to his service connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

For the purpose of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability, in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, or of one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) Disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3) Disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g. orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) Multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) Multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5).

In Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) interpreted the phrase substantially gainful employment to include an economic component and a non-economic component.  The economic component is defined as occupations earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce for one person.  The Court, in addressing the non-economic component of the ability to secure and follow that type of employment held that attention must be given to the veteran's history, education, skill and training, and whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the type of activities (e.g., sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy) required to the occupation at issue.  Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the Veteran's limitations, if any, concerning lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, and reaching, and auditory and visual limitations, and whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.  Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the veteran's limitations, if any, concerning memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle workplace stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate ability and productivity.

Here, the Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for asthma with a 30 percent evaluation from October 27, 2010, for sinusitis with a 50 percent evaluation from January 11, 2021, and for eczema with a 10 percent evaluation from January 11, 2021.  Thus, from January 11, 2021, the Veteran meets the schedular requirements of TDIU by being service connected for two disabilities affecting a single body system, that is, the respiratory system, which in combination are rated at 40 percent or more, and with sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  The remaining inquiry of this appealed issue is whether the most probative and persuasive evidence supports that the Veteran's service-connected disability precluded his participation in a substantially gainful occupation at any time from January 11, 2021; that is, from the date in which he complied with the schedular requirement of TDIU.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009).

The Board notes that, in granting the Veteran's TDIU claim, VA has already conceded that the Veteran became too disabled to be gainfully employed between May and November 2021.  See September 12, 2022, VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability; July 29, 2023, higher-level review rating decision.

The Board also notes the Veteran's completion of his occupational therapy assistant degree while participating in VA's vocational rehabilitation program.  In a January 27, 2023, feasibility determination narrative report, it was determined that the Veteran's achievement of a vocational goal was not currently reasonably feasible.  Particularly, the Veteran was addressing significant medical issues that precluded his participation for employment.  This differed from the impact of the Veteran's impairments at the time of his original entitlement and feasibility determination.  In a January 27, 2023, discontinuance closure statement, a negative feasibility determination was made, based on the Veteran's documented worsening medical issues and statements.  Thus, given the Veteran's inability to work in a competitive setting and his request to close his case, the vocational rehabilitation counselor recommended discontinuance with the rehabilitation program.  See also February 17, 2022, academic transcript.

Thus, after careful consideration by the Board, and giving the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran, from May 1, 2021 (the earliest possible date that the record reflects that the Veteran was unable to work), but not earlier, entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to a service-connected disability (TDIU) is granted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.3, 4.7, 4.15, 4.16, 4.18, 4.19.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation, prior to September 15, 2021, for service-connected migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, is remanded.

The Veteran claims entitlement to a compensable evaluation, prior to September 15, 2021, for his service-connected migraine, including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits.

Service treatment records show an April 1998 report of medical assessment where the Veteran's headaches were noted, and a neuro consult was requested.  Also, in a separation report of medical history from April 1998, the Veteran reported frequent or severe headaches.  Further, in a separation report of medical examination, the examiner noted the Veteran's mixed headache migraine component by history.  Finally, an April 1998 note shows the Veteran's reporting of frontal occipital bandlike headache with an assessment of headaches - mixed.

A September 1998 VA headaches medical examination noted the Veteran's reported symptoms, including headaches on a daily basis and lasting many hours, with occasional nausea, vomiting and photophobia once a month.  However, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's headaches had improved with medication for his sinusitis and that his diagnosis of migraine headaches was based solely on his subjective account of symptoms.

In a February 1999 statement, the Veteran reported that he was diagnosed and treated for mixed migraine/tension pattern headaches while in service and that his treatment for sinusitis did not alleviate his headache symptoms.

The Board finds the September 1998 VA headaches medical examination inadequate to determine the severity of the Veteran's migraine symptoms prior to September 15, 2021.

Under the AMA, the Board must remand to the AOJ to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors (including when the AOJ failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain VA treatment records or relevant federal or private treatment records, failed to obtain a VA examination, or provided an inadequate VA examination or opinion).  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-125 (2007).

Thus, the Board finds that the evidence of record is insufficient and that a retrospective medical opinion is necessary for adjudication of the Veteran's claim of entitlement to a compensable rating for migraines prior to September 15, 2021.  Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80 (2008).

Accordingly, on remand, a retrospective medical opinion as to the severity of the service-connected migraine including migraine variants with complex migraines with deficits, prior to September 15, 2021, should be requested.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

The AOJ should arrange for an examination of the Veteran to assess the severity of his service-connected migraine headaches, prior to September 15, 2021.  The examiner must review the entire record (including this remand) in conjunction with the examination and note such review was conducted.  The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and then report all signs and symptoms associated with the Veteran's disability.

The examiner is requested to provide a retrospective opinion regarding the severity of the Veteran's migraine headaches, prior to September 15, 2021, to include using statements elicited from the Veteran.

o In addressing the above, the examiner must discuss all studies, tests, and evaluations related to the Veteran's migraines.  Any and all studies, tests, and evaluations that are deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed.

o The examiner is advised that the Veteran is considered competent to be able to report injuries and symptoms, and that his reports must be considered in formulating the requested opinions.  If the Veteran's reports are discounted, the examiner should provide a reason for doing so.

o A complete rationale should be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed.  If any opinion cannot be given without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why and state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner does not have the knowledge or training that is necessary to provide the requested opinion.
