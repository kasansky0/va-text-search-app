ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 9, 2014 for the grant of service connection for allergic rhinitis is denied.

Entitlement to an initial disability rating for allergic rhinitis with deviated nasal septum in excess of 10 percent from November 9, 2014 to July 17, 2023 and 30 percent from July 18, 2023 is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. ?The January 2024 RO rating decision implemented the November 2023 Board decision's grant of an effective date of November 9, 2014 for the service connection of allergic rhinitis. The grant of service connection for allergic rhinitis arises from the November 9, 2014 original claim for service connection for rhinitis.

2. The Veteran's allergic rhinitis with deviated nasal septum was characterized by rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50-percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides from November 9, 2014 to July 17, 2023 and rhinitis with polyps from July 18, 2023. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than November 9, 2014 for the grant of service connection for allergic rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

2. The criteria for an initial disability rating for allergic rhinitis with deviated nasal septum in excess of 10 percent from November 9, 2014 to July 17, 2023 and 30 percent from July 18, 2023 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.20, 4.21, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from April 1996 to April 2000.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2015 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

The instant matter has a long procedural history. The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for allergic rhinitis in November 2014 that was denied in a June 2015 rating decision. He appealed with a notice of disagreement in July 2015. A statement of the case was issued in February 2017. The Veteran submitted a substantive appeal in March 2017. The case was remanded by the Board in July 2019, April 2020, March 2021, April 2022, and January 2023. Respective supplemental statements of the case (SSOC) were issued in February 2020, December 2020, June 2021, and September 2022. A June 2023 rating decision granted service connection pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act). A SSOC was again issued in September 2023. A November 2023 Board decision granted service connection (on a basis other than the PACT Act) effective from November 9, 2014. A January 2024 rating decision effectuated the grant of service connection and assigned a 10 percent rating from November 9, 2014 to July 17, 2023 and a 30 percent rating from July 18, 2023. The Veteran appealed for an earlier effective date and an increased rating with a February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). 

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 9, 2014 for the grant of service connection for allergic rhinitis. 

As a preliminary matter, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertion on the February 2024 VA Form 10182 that remand is warranted for a retrospective examination to determine whether allergic rhinitis and deviated septum conditions worsened and/or caused sleep apnea, chronic sinusitis, and sleep disturbances. However, these issues are not properly before the Board, and remand for additional development of these issues is not warranted. The Board notes that sleep apnea, chronic sinusitis, and sleep disturbances have already been service-connected, or attributed to other service-connected disabilities. Service connection was already granted for adjustment disorder with anxiety in April 2007 (of which the symptom of sleep disturbances were attributed), sleep apnea in April 2020, and chronic sinusitis in June 2023. The current appeal arises from the January 2024 rating decision that implemented a grant of service connection for allergic rhinitis. As such, the Board finds that VA's duty to assist has been met, and remand for a retrospective examination is not warranted. 

Turning to the matter on appeal, the Veteran asserts he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection of allergic rhinitis earlier than November 9, 2014. 

An AOJ decision implementing a Board grant is not a "decision" the Board has the authority to review under 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).?The January 2024 RO rating decision implemented the November 2023 Board decision's grant of an effective date of November 9, 2014 for the service connection of allergic rhinitis. As such, this matter is not reviewable by another Board decision except on a motion for revision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error or motion for reconsideration of the Board decision. There is no CUE claim or motion for reconsideration before the Board. 

In any event, generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). If a claim is filed within one year after separation from service, service connection will be effective as of the day after separation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

The evidence does not reveal, and the Veteran has not asserted that a claim was filed within 1 year after separation of service. Thus, the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date immediately after his separation from service.

The Board's inquiry thus turns to when a claim was first submitted. A review of the record indicates the Veteran submitted an original claim for service connection of allergic rhinitis on November 9, 2014. The currently assigned effective date for service connection for allergic rhinitis is already based on this date.

After a thorough review of the record, the Board notes that there are no earlier claims, formal or informal, for service connection of allergic rhinitis. Thus, November 9, 2014 is the earliest possible effective date for the grant of service connection for allergic rhinitis. Accordingly, November 9, 2014 is the appropriate effective date, and an earlier effective date is not warranted.

2. Entitlement to an initial disability rating for allergic rhinitis with deviated nasal septum in excess of 10 percent from November 9, 2014 to July 17, 2023 and 30 percent from July 18, 2023. 

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis with deviated nasal septum is currently rated as 10 percent disabling from November 9, 2014 to July 17, 2023 and 30 percent disabling from July 18, 2023. 

The June 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions combined the evaluations for allergic rhinitis and deviated nasal septum into a single rating in order to avoid violating the rules against pyramiding. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.14, 4.96. 

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis with deviated nasal septum is currently rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522. It was previously rated under Diagnostic Code 6502. 

Diagnostic Code 6522 provides that a 10 percent rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis, without polyps, but greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction of one side. A maximum of 30 percent is assignable for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps. Where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31

Under Diagnostic Code 6502, a 10 percent rating is warranted for deviation of the nasal septum involving 50-percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.

The evidence persuasively weighs in favor of finding the Veteran's allergic rhinitis with deviated nasal septum is appropriately rated as 10 percent disabling from November 9, 2014 to July 17, 2023, and 30 percent thereafter.

A February 2015 VA nasal endoscopy revealed minimal mucosal edema, anterior trace epistaxis in the right nasal septum, and no masses. 

During the December 2020 VA examination, the Veteran reported morning bleeding of the nose, skin peeling, no sleep, and loss of smell and taste. The December 2020 and August 2022 examinations revealed greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides due to rhinitis and permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates. The examinations did not reveal nasal polyps or at least 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides due to traumatic septal deviation. A November 2020 X-ray revealed a negative nasal bone exam. 

During the May 2021 VA examination, he reported runny nose, watery eyes, and right side nose bleeds periodically. Clinical examination revealed patent nasal passages, moist and pink mucosa membranes, no discharge or secretion, no nasal obstruction on exam, and no sign of nasal bleeding. 

During the July 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported headaches, epistaxis daily, and daily congestion. Clinical examination revealed permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates and nasal polyps. This is the first medical evidence revealing nasal polyps. 

For the period from November 9, 2014 to July 17, 2023, the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of establishing rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50-percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides. This approximates the criteria for a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6522. A rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted for this period as the evidence does not persuasively show polyps. VA treatment records and the December 2020, May 2021, and August 2022 VA examinations do not reveal polyps. The July 2023 VA examination report was the first medical evidence establishing the presence of polyps during the appeal period.

For the period from July 18, 2023, the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of establishing rhinitis with polyps. This approximates a 30 percent rating, the maximum possible schedular rating for allergic rhinitis with deviated nasal septum. Accordingly, a higher rating is not warranted. 

The Board has also considered the applicability of alternative diagnostic codes for rating this service-connected disability. However, because allergic rhinitis and deviated septum have specific codes, Diagnostic Codes 6502 and 6522, rating by analogy under other codes is not permissible. When a condition is specifically listed in the Rating Schedule, it may not be rated by analogy. Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 338 (2014). Epistaxis is typically rated by analogy to Diagnostic Code 6502. Further, the Veteran is already separately service-connected for chronic sinusitis. Thus, using the criteria under Diagnostic Code 6512 and the General Rating Formula for Sinusitis to evaluate his service-connected allergic rhinitis with deviated nasal septum would violate the rules against pyramiding. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's report of additional symptoms such as loss of smell, sleep disturbance, and skin rashes. However, the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of finding that these symptoms are already compensated by service-connected disabilities and/or attributable to diagnoses other than allergic rhinitis and deviated nasal septum. During the December 2020 VA examination, the Veteran reported morning bleeding of the nose, skin peeling, no sleep, loss of smell and taste. During the July 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported headaches and a red, itchy rash. However, the July 2023 examiner stated the rash was consistent with eczema based on pictures shown by the Veteran. Additionally, the reported headaches, loss of smell/taste, and no sleep are symptoms that are already contemplated and compensated by service-connected tension headaches, anosmia, adjustment disorder with anxiety, and/or sleep apnea. Additional compensation for these reported symptoms would violate the rule against pyramiding. The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. Separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury only where the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994). 

In sum, the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of establishing rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50-percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides for the period from November 9, 2014 to July 17, 2023, and rhinitis with polyps from July 18, 2023. ?

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence establishes that a rating in excess of 10 percent from November 9, 2014 to July 17, 2023 and 30 percent from July 18, 2023 for allergic rhinitis with deviated nasal septum is not warranted. In denying such a rating, the Board finds the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable as the evidence persuasively weighs against an increased rating. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
