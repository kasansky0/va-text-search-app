INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 1987 to August 1990, from January to March 1991, and from March 1999 to August 2001.

In October and December 2021, the Regional Office (RO) issued rating decisions which addressed the above-noted issues.  Thereafter, in June 2022 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), wherein he sought to appeal the claims in the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) System.  He selected the Evidence Submission lane.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October and December 2021 rating decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.

Of note, the Veteran also attempted to appeal the assigned disability rating for his right ear hearing loss in his June 2022 NOD; however, the most recent rating decision addressing that matter was issued in August 2002.  As such, this appeal is not timely, and the Board will not address this issue further.    

FINDING OF FACT

In January 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that he desired to withdraw his appeal.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee instability have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the veteran or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(a).  

The withdrawal must include the name of the veteran, the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety, or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).

In a January 2025 correspondence, the Veteran's attorney indicated the Veteran wished to withdraw his pending appeal, to include all pending disability compensation claims.  This letter included the Veteran's name and file number.  The Board finds the January 2025 correspondence was a valid withdrawal of the Veteran's claims on appeal and was effective upon receipt.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(3).  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the Veteran's appeal, and this matter must be dismissed.
