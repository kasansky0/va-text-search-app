ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a disability manifested by fatigue as due to undiagnosed illness is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran had signs and symptoms of fatigue in and since service in Southwest Asia that have not been attributed to a known clinical diagnosis.

2.  The evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea had its onset during his active duty service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for disability manifested by fatigue as due to an undiagnosed illness are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.317.

2.  With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for sleep apnea are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2000 to January 2004, to include combat service in Southwest Asia.? He is in receipt of, among other decorations, the Combat Action Ribbon and Purple Heart.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that, among other things, denied the claims of service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and sleep apnea.  The Board is bound by the favorable?findings?in the decision that the Veteran was treated for fatigue in July 2022, has a diagnosis of sleep apnea, and participated in toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) in Kuwait.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The Veteran timely appealed the July 2024 rating decision in an August 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and selected direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).? 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(b)(1).? Accordingly, the Board will review the evidence of record as of the date of the July 2024 rating decision.? 38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.? The Board will not consider evidence added to the record after the date of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.? If evidence was added during this ineligible period, the Board did not consider it.? If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, he may at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).? If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the?grant?of the benefit or benefits sought.? 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).?? 

The Board notes that the Veteran also indicated in his August 2024 VA Form 10182 that he was appealing the November 2023 rating decision that deferred the decisions on entitlement to compensation for CFS and sleep apnea.  However, the November 2023 decision was not an adjudicative determination that can be appealed.  Cf. Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 462 (2011) (a deferred rating is not an adjudicative determination that can be appealed).  Thus, the November 2023 rating decision is not on appeal here.

As a final preliminary matter, the Board generally may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting a docket switch under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) has elapsed.? Williams?v.?McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024). ?38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows claimants to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new NOD within one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives an NOD, whichever is later, unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony.? In this case, although the deadline for requesting a docket switch has not elapsed here, there is no prejudice in proceeding with adjudication of the claims as the benefits sought are being granted in full.??

Service connection 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that?current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110;?38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease;?and?(3) a relationship between the two.  Saunders v. Wilkie,?886 F.3d 1356, 1361?(Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

Entitlement to service connection for signs and symptoms of fatigue as due to undiagnosed illness 

The Veteran essentially contended in his July 2023 Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) that he has experienced fatigue since his combat experience in Iraq in April 2003 where his vehicle was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(1), compensation is warranted for a Persian Gulf veteran who exhibits objective indications of a "qualifying chronic disability" that became manifest during service on active duty in the Armed Forces in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations during the Persian Gulf War, or to a degree of 10 percent during the presumptive period prescribed by the Secretary.  The presumptive period was most recently extended to December 31, 2026.  Interim Final Rule, Extension of the Presumptive Period for Compensation for Persian Gulf War Veterans, 86 Fed. Reg. 51000 (Sept. 14, 2021).  Furthermore, the chronic disability must not be attributed to any known clinical disease by history, physical examination, or laboratory tests.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(ii).

Congress revised 38 U.S.C. § 1117, effective March 1, 2002.  In the revised statute, the term "chronic disability" was changed to "qualifying chronic disability," and the definition of "qualifying chronic disability" was expanded to include (a) undiagnosed illness; (b) a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness (including, but not limited to, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and functional gastrointestinal disorders) that is defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms; or (c) any diagnosed illness that the Secretary determines, in regulations, warrants a presumption of service connection.  Effective June 10, 2003, VA promulgated revised regulations to, in part, implement these statutory changes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2).

For purposes of Gulf War undiagnosed illness claims, disabilities that have existed for six months or more, and disabilities that exhibit intermittent episodes of improvement and worsening over a six-month period, will be considered chronic. The six-month period of chronicity will be measured from the earliest date on which the pertinent evidence establishes that the signs or symptoms of the disability first became manifest.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(5).

To determine whether the qualifying chronic disability is manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more the condition must be rated by analogy to a disease or injury in which the functions affected, anatomical location, or symptomatology are similar.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(5); Stankevich v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 470 (2006).

In the case of claims based on undiagnosed illness or a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness, unlike those for direct service connection, there is no requirement that there be competent evidence of a nexus between the claimed illness and service.  38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317; Gutierrez v. Principi, 19 Vet. App. 1, 8-9 (2004).

For the following reasons, service connection for a disability manifested by fatigue as due to undiagnosed illness is warranted.

First, the Veteran qualifies as a Persian Gulf veteran and currently experiences fatigue, which is specifically listed as a sign or symptom of undiagnosed illness.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(b)(1).  The Veteran's fatigue is different than the CFS referenced as an example of a medically explained chronic multisymptom illness (MUCMI).  Notably, a May 2024 VA examiner found that the Veteran had a disability manifested by fatigue as to due to undiagnosed illness and no diagnosis of CFS.  In addition, the Veteran has consistently, credibly, and competently indicated that such fatigue has persisted since service, and therefore, has persisted more than six months.  Gutierrez, 19 Vet. App. at 8-9 (lay persons are competent to report objective signs of illness).  Specifically, the Veteran indicated in his July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ that he has experienced fatigue since his combat experience in Iraq in April 2003.

Thus, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran's fatigue has not been attributed to a known clinical diagnosis, as noted in the May 2024 VA examination, and became manifest during the Veteran's service in the Persian Gulf War.  

For the above reasons, the evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran had signs and symptoms of fatigue in and since service in Southwest Asia that have not been attributed to a known clinical diagnosis.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for disability manifested by fatigue as due to undiagnosed illness is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea

The Veteran essentially contended in his July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ that he has experienced sleep apnea since his combat experience in Iraq in April 2003 where his vehicle was hit by an RPG.

For the following reasons, entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is warranted.      

The Board is bound by the favorable finding in the July 2024 rating decision that the Veteran has a diagnosis of sleep apnea.  Therefore, the Veteran meets the current disability requirement for the claim.

The Veteran's DD Form 214 noting his Combat Action Ribbon reflects that he engaged in combat.  The finding that a veteran engaged in combat allows a combat veteran to use satisfactory lay or other evidence to establish that he was injured or incurred a disability while on active duty, even in cases where there is no official record that such injury or disability occurred.  Reeves v. Shinseki, 682 F.3d 988, 998 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 38 U.S.C. § 1154(b)).  Moreover, the fact that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy not only assists him in establishing the in-service disease or injury element but may also assist him in establishing the incurrence of the disability itself.  Id. 

The Veteran's reports of sleep-related symptoms in a combat situation in service as indicated in his July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ is satisfactory evidence, and his reports are credible and consistent with the circumstances of his service in Southwest Asia.  Also, the Veteran reported on an October 2003 Report of Medical Examination that he was not sleeping well.  Therefore, the presence of sleep-related symptoms during service is established.  Additionally, the Veteran's post-service medical records and lay statements essentially indicate that he has experienced continuous sleep-related symptoms, to include snoring, in the years since service.

The Veteran is competent to report sleep-related symptoms in service and continuous symptoms in the years since service.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  In addition, his statements regarding his sleep-related symptoms are generally internally consistent, consistent with the other evidence of record, and consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service.  Therefore, the Veteran's reports of sleep-related symptoms in service and continuous symptoms in the years since service are credible and therefore competent.

In addition, the Veteran's lay statements indicating sleep-related symptoms both in and since separation from service, combined with the diagnosis of sleep apnea, are sufficient to establish that the Veteran's sleep apnea had its onset in service. Furthermore, as was reasoned in Maples v. Wilkie, No. 18-2016 (Vet. App. Feb. 11, 2019), sleep apnea is the type of disability for which lay evidence can be sufficient to support a claim for service connection for sleep apnea.  Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).

Moreover, a February 2024 VA opinion is not probative as it was based on the inaccurate factual premise that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of sleep apnea.  Reonal?v. Brown,?5 Vet. App. 458, 461?(1993) (a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise is not probative). 

To the extent that the grant of service connection for sleep apnea disability is based primarily on lay evidence, "nothing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] require both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself."  Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1335.    

In addition, as noted above, the fact that the Veteran engaged in combat during service does not prevent him from also invoking the section 1154(b) presumption in order to show that he incurred the disabilities while in service.  Reeves, 682 F.3d at 999.  Given the application of 38 U.S.C. § 1154(b) as explained in Reeves, the evidence of record discussed above provides a sufficient basis to conclude that his disability was incurred in service. 

At this point, the Board could remand the claim of service connection for a VA examination or opinion.  However, a request for an opinion could be construed as obtaining additional evidence for the sole purpose of denying the claim, which is impermissible.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c) ("The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination"); Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021) ("Remand is inappropriate where the predominant purpose is not to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision unencumbered by error but to allow VA to obtain more evidence so that it can properly deny the claim").    

For the above reasons, the evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea had its onset during his active duty service.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
