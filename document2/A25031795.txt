ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder condition is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's left shoulder condition is not secondary to her service-connected hallux valgus and is not otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder condition have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1975 to November 1977.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) under the modernized review system, or Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

In July 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2021 decision. In October 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2021 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 decision.

In the December 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder condition is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for her left shoulder condition secondary to her service-connected left foot hallux valgus. See July 2021 VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review.

There have been no allegations of relationship to military service on a direct basis, so the Board shall proceed to a discussion only on the issue of secondary service connection.

Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a)-(b). Secondary causation exists when, but for the service-connected disability, the non-service-connected was caused by a service-connected disability either in a direct, etiological way or via multiple steps in a causal chain. Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (citations omitted). Secondary aggravation exists when the non-service-connected disability not caused by a service-connected disability would be less severe were it not for a service-connected disability. Id. at 1364. For example, secondary aggravation may be established where the natural progression of the non-service-connected disability could have been arrested or improved but for the service-connected disability. Id.

In the October 2021 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable findings that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a left shoulder disability and that the primary disability, hallux valgus, is service connected. The Board is bound by these favorable findings.

Therefore, the remaining question before the Board is if the current left shoulder disability was either caused by or aggravated by a service-connected disability.

There is no evidence in the record that suggests the Veteran's left shoulder condition, which was diagnosed in 2017 as degenerative changes of the shoulder, is related to her service or her service-connected hallux valgus. See VA Medical Records.

The only evidence suggesting a nexus between the Veteran's left shoulder condition and service is the statement from the Veteran herself. The Veteran is competent to testify as to a condition within her knowledge and personal observation. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308-310 (2007). However, she is not competent to diagnose such disability or render a nexus, as it requires specialized medical knowledge and specific testing. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (stating that competent medical evidence means evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions). Therefore, the Veteran's statements regarding the nexus between her left shoulder condition and her service are lacking in probative value.

The Board is cognizant that the Veteran has not been provided a VA examination or medical opinion concerning her claim for service connection for a left shoulder condition. Neither the Veteran's statements nor anything in the record raise the possibility of substantiating a claim for service connection for a left shoulder condition. As there is no reasonable possibility that a medical examination or medical opinion would help substantiate the appeal, the Board finds that further development is not necessary. See Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (2010) (VA is not required to provide a medical examination when there is no credible evidence of an in-service event, injury, or disease); see also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81(2006).

In this instance, the Board concludes that the most probative evidence establishes that the Veteran's left shoulder condition was neither caused by nor aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected left foot hallux valgus. Therefore, this appeal must be denied.
