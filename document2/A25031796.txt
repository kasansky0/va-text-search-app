REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a low back disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from June 1981 to June 1985.

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for lumbar strain with lumbar fusion at L3-L4 in a May 2021 rating decision (RD).

The Veteran subsequently submitted a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD)) in May 2024, appealing the denial and choosing the "Direct Review" lane.  As such, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, that is, evidence submitted prior to May 28, 2024.

The Board acknowledges that the period to change AMA dockets per 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.202 (c)(2) has not yet elapsed.  However, the Board finds that a docket switch letter pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024) is not necessary because the Veteran will have an opportunity to submit additional evidence to be considered on remand and this remand is not considered a final adjudication of the issue on appeal.  Accordingly, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with the remand.  Id.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a low back disability is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a low back disability is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the May 2022 RD on appeal.

Specifically, the Veteran was examined for his low back disability in March 2023.  March 2023, VA-VES Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) Conditions examination.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with lumbar strain with lumbar fusion at L3-L4.  The Veteran reported that he injured his low back during boot camp and that he has experienced low back pain since that time, despite the lack of documentation.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's low back disability was not related to service because there was no documentation in the service treatment records of an in-service injury and no documentation of treatment until 2019.  However, she did not address whether the Veteran's lay statements of in-service and continuous post-service low back symptoms could support a nexus, notwithstanding the lack of documentation.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 254 (2020).  

Furthermore, and most importantly, the examiner did not explain how she arrived at her conclusion.  Essentially providing a conclusory opinion.  However, any opinion expressed by a VA examiner must "contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).  Here, while there was a clear conclusion, there was no data or a reasoned medical explanation.  As such, the low back claim must be remanded for an addendum opinion that addresses the relevance of these statements.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("the Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence"); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Send the Veteran's claims file to an appropriate examiner to provide an addendum opinion regarding the nature and etiology of his lumbar spine disability.  The examiner must review the entire claims file in conjunction with the opinion.  The Veteran may be recalled for examination if deemed necessary.

The examiner must opine whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed lumbar spine disability is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The examiner should specifically address the Veteran's reports that he first experienced low back pain in service and has continuously experienced low back pain since that time, notwithstanding the lack of documentation.

2. The examiner must provide a clear conclusion, along with supporting data, and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).

"	The term "at least as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility."  Rather, it means that the weight of medical evidence both for and against a conclusion is so evenly divided that it is as medically sound to find in favor of the conclusion (e.g., etiology) as it is to find against the conclusion.

3. THE AOJ MUST REVIEW THE CLAIMS FILE AND ENSURE THAT THE FOREGOING DEVELOPMENT ACTION HAS BEEN COMPLETED IN FULL.

a)  IF ANY DEVELOPMENT IS INCOMPLETE, APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION MUST BE IMPLEMENTED.

b)  IF ANY REPORT DOES NOT INCLUDE ADEQUATE RESPONSES TO THE SPECIFIC OPINIONS REQUESTED, IT MUST BE RETURNED TO THE PROVIDING EXAMINER FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION.
