REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2006 to June 2010.

The matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 rating decision issued by a Regional Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which conducted a higher-level review (HLR) of a February 2023 rating decision.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's February 2023 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the rating decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

By way of procedural history, in the respective March 2019 rating decisions, the Veteran was awarded service connection for his migraine and psychiatric disabilities, both rated at 50 percent, effective December 7, 2018. 

On March 30, 2021, the Veteran initiated a claim for a TDIU by submitting a Fully Developed Claim and VA 21-8940, wherein she contended that her unemployability was due to her migraine disability. In response, a May 2021 rating decision denied a TDIU and, although it initially continued the Veteran's 50 percent rating for migraines, a later June 2021 rating decision noted that the May 2021 rating decision regarding the 50 percent rating was in error and proposed a reduction of the migraine rating to 30 percent.

In a December 2021 rating decision, the AOJ effectuated the June 2021 proposal to reduce the rating to 30 percent, effective March 1, 2022. Pursuant to the Veteran's February 2022 request for a HLR of the December 2021 rating decision, an informal conference was held between the Veteran's representative and the RO's decision review officer (DRO). Thereafter, the AOJ issued a February 2022 HLR rating decision wherein the AOJ determined that the reduction from 50 percent to 30 percent for a migraine disability, effective March 1, 2022, was proper.

Within one year of the May 2021 rating decision that denied a TDIU, VA received the Veteran's Supplemental Claim for TDIU in October 2021. In response to that Supplemental Claim, the AOJ denied a TDIU in its July 2022 rating decision.

On August 31, 2022, VA received the Veteran's ItF. Within one year of both the July 2022 rating decision and the August 2022 ItF, VA received the Veteran's Supplemental Claim to the July 2022 rating decision that denied a TDIU, in October 2022. In addition, the Veteran submitted another VA 21-8940, wherein she claimed that all her service-connected disabilities were the cause of her unemployability. Thereafter, in the February 2023 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran's psychiatric disability rating was increased from 50 to 70 percent, effective August 31, 2022, the date VA received the Veteran's ItF.  Also, in that same rating decision, the Veteran's migraine disability was decreased from 30 percent to a noncompensable rating, effective October 24, 2022, the date of the most recent VA headache examination.

The Board notes that a TDIU claim is "part and parcel" with an increased rating claim. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Also, as detailed further later herein, the Board notes that since VA's receipt of the Veteran's claim for a TDIU on March 30, 2021, the Veteran continuously pursued her TDIU and increased rating claims with her October 2021 and October 2022 Supplemental Claims, which were all received with new and relevant evidence and within the requisite one year from their applicable rating decisions. Although the March 2021 TDIU claim initially attributed the Veteran's unemployability to her migraine disability, in the later October 2022 Supplemental Claim, she asserted that all her service-connected disabilities were factors in her unemployability. For the sake of consistency, and to afford the Veteran the most favorable result permissible, the Board finds that the March 2021 TDIU claim also raises the question of whether the severity of the Veteran's psychiatric disability was a factor of unemployability. As such, the Board finds her continuously pursued claim for a TDIU includes increased rating claims for both her migraine and psychiatric disabilities, and such was not broken since March 30, 2021, the date VA first received her TDIU claim. 

As explained in further detail below, the effective date for a rating in this case is to consider the date the first claim in the continuously pursued chain was made, and the date when entitlement to a rating arose (the term "entitlement" defined later herein), with the effective date to be the later date of the two. 38?U.S.C. §?5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (h). In addition, for non-initial increased rating claims, such as in this case, the evidentiary focus is from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). Therefore, the Board finds the period under appellate review for the Veteran's claims for a TDIU and increased disability ratings begins on March 30, 2020, which is one year prior to the receipt of her first claim in her continuously pursued chain on March 30, 2021. Id. 

Of note, in June 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, seeking an appeal of the December 2021 rating decision that effectuated the migraine rating reduction to 30 percent (though the February 2022 HLR rating decision was noted in the 10182). In response to the evidentiary lane request made in the June 2022 10182, that appeal was docketed in a separate appeal stream and, as such, will not be addressed herein. 

Effective Dates and Increased Ratings

Unless specifically provided otherwise in applicable law, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application for said benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Under the current Appeal Modernization Act (AMA) system, (applicable to decisions issued on or after February 19, 2019, such as in the present case), a claim can be continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when that decision was issued, if new and relevant evidence is received within that time. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1), the effective date for such continuously pursued claim will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial "claim" or date "entitlement arose", whichever is later. Stated another way, if a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (h). 

The term "claim" or "application" means a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the VA and, as of March 2015, submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). The date of claim is the date it was received by VA, not the date the Veteran sent it to VA. 

Although the phrase "entitlement arose" is not specifically defined in the current statute or regulation, the United Stated Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. This is determined on a "facts found" basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). This means the date the disability manifested, once it has been determined that it is service connected. 

In short, the effective date for an increased rating for a service-connected disability generally can be no earlier than the date the increase in severity first manifested and no earlier than the date of claim, with the effective date to be the later date of the two. However, for non-initial increased rating claims, such as in this case, the effective date can be from one year before a claim is received if the facts so allow, as explained further later herein. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

As to rating disabilities, disability evaluations are determined by comparing a Veteran's present symptoms with criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(a), Part 4. In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). 

In all rating evaluations, each disability is to be viewed "in relation to its history" to "accurately reflect the elements of disability present". 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 62 (2012); see also Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (discussing 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1 and 4.2 and stating that, although a veteran was "only entitled to disability compensation for the period after ... the date he filed his original claim for benefits," the disability history is to be considered. In Schafrath, the Court explained that "[t]hese requirements for evaluation of the complete medical history of the claimant's condition operate to protect claimants against adverse decisions based on a single, incomplete or inaccurate report and to enable VA to make a more precise evaluation of the level of the disability and of any changes in the condition." Schafrath, at 594. As such, VA should interpret reports of examination "in light of the whole recorded history", reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2.

"Staged" ratings are appropriate for an increased-rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods when the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms warranting different ratings irrespective of whether an initial or established rating. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, at 509 (2007). The effective date of an award of increased compensation should not be assigned mechanically based on the date of an examination. Rather, all of the facts should be examined to determine the earliest date that it is ascertainable that an increase in disability first manifested. Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations apply, the higher of the two should be assigned where the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. In general, it is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

In sum, the ratings assigned to the Veteran's respective disabilities are based on the criteria of the applicable diagnostic codes in line with the relevant regulations and case law, e.g., 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(a), and are assigned respective effective dates that are no earlier than the date the level of impairment for each of the respective disabilities first manifested and no earlier than the date of the claim for them, to include the first claim in a continuously pursued chain, with the effective date to be the later date of the two. 38?U.S.C. §?5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (h); see also, McGrath, supra;?Hart, supra. In addition, as noted earlier, for non-initial increased rating claims, "[t]he relevant temporal focus for adjudicating an increased-rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim." Hart, supra at 509; 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 31, 2022, for the award of a 70 percent rating for unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder with alcohol use disorder.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder with alcohol use disorder.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the non-initial 70 percent rating, as well as a higher rating, for her service-connected psychiatric disability. See May 2024 VA form 10182. 

As previously explained, the start of the appellate period under review for the psychiatric disability is not limited from the time of VA's receipt of the October 2022 Supplemental Claim (which the AOJ associated with the Veteran's ItF received on August 31, 2022). The period under appellate review commences on March 30, 2021, with a one-year look back period. 

As the Board explained above, the effective date of a non-initial rating assigned is not solely based on the date the increase in severity appeared or the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating the existence of such disability; rather, the effective date is assigned based on consideration of the date that the claim upon which the increase in rating was eventually awarded was received by VA, to include the date of up to one year prior to that claim, and can be no earlier than the date the increase in severity of the disability first manifested. McGrath, supra;?38?U.S.C. §?5110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.400. 

So, to exemplify the above-cited law in the present case, if an increase in severity of the Veteran's psychiatric disability had manifested before the one-year mark prior to VA's receipt of her March 2021 TDIU claim, which is the first claim in her continuously pursued claim, the earliest permissible date for an increase in rating would be the later date of manifestation. In this case, as the Board explains later herein, the manifestation date of a 70 percent severity, as dictated by the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (as defined below), is the date of May 14, 2021, wherein a private counseling treatment record supported such increase in severity finding.  However, as explained below, a rating higher than 70 percent is not warranted.

The Veteran's psychiatric disability is currently rated as 70 percent disabling pursuant to the criteria set forth in the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders as described in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9413. A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9413.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name. Id.

When evaluating a mental disorder, the rating agency shall consider the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the capacity for adjustment during periods of remission. The rating agency shall assign an evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment, rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination. When evaluating the level of disability from a mental disorder, the rating agency will consider the extent of social impairment but shall not assign an evaluation solely on the basis of social impairment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.126.

The "such symptoms as" language of the diagnostic codes for mental disorders in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 means "for example" and does not represent an exhaustive list of symptoms that must be found before granting the rating of that category. See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). However, as the Court also pointed out in that case, "[w]ithout those examples, differentiating a 30 percent evaluation from a 50 percent evaluation would be extremely ambiguous." Id. The Court went on to state that the list of examples "provides guidance as to the severity of symptoms contemplated for each rating." Id. Accordingly, while each of the examples needs not be proven in any one case, the particular symptoms must be analyzed in light of those given examples. Put another way, the severity represented by those examples may not be ignored.

The Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria under the General Rating Formula. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

As explained below, the Board finds that the Veteran experiences occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed, in pertinent part, the November 2022 VA psychiatric examination, VA examinations regarding other disabilities, the Veteran's statements, and the Veteran's ex-girlfriend's statements, and found that they indicate the level of impairment caused by the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms more closely approximates the level associated with a 70 percent rating.

Turning to the evidence of record, in a statement provided by the Veteran's ex-girlfriend received in March 2021, she describes the Veteran "displaying some very aggressive behavior when she experiences migraines and mood swings. They happen pretty often, and they tend to become violent. So much in fact that [they] were previously in a relationship and have broken up over these episodes. The last time we argued she threatened to shoot me after she continued to shove me while crying and yelling in my face as well as beating down the bathroom door to get to me". 

At the same time that VA received her girlfriend's statement in March 2021, VA received the Veteran's statement wherein she stated that her "history of work is very short, and [she] thought maybe if [she] moved away from everything it would help. With [her] partner [there, she] could afford to pay [her] portion of the rent but [her partner is] ready to leave and [she is] in fear of being homeless again. Paying [her] bills, paying for therapy and [her] essentials will hit [her] hard when [her partner] leaves. [She does not] know what to do and [she] feel[s] extremely hopeless, almost like a failure". However, private counseling treatment records, received in May 2021, show that in April 2021 the Veteran reported that it was her girlfriend who was violent. Specifically, the Veteran stated that "she is focusing on herself and learning to be her own best friend. She is still planning on moving to Dallas, Texas in June [2021] without her girlfriend. Her girlfriend is not aware. She is not speaking to her regarding this separation until she goes as her girlfriend tends to be violent and she does not want to deal with this currently. She has several things in the work financially and currently waiting on a response from Netflix on music that she presented to them". By May 2021, private counseling treatment records include the Veteran's reports of an incident where she became so angry that "she lost it". The May 2021 records also reflect the private therapist's evaluation of the Veteran's psychiatric disability to measure 8/10 on both the depression and anxiety scales.

In August 2021, after moving to Dallas, Texas, the Veteran sought mental health treatment through the VA. In an initial VA evaluation noted in a VA Mental Health Note dated August 16, 2021, the Veteran reported that "she has manic highs and lows [and] is often irritable out of nowhere". Also, she stated that "she had a difficult breakup before moving and is now living closer to family for first time in a long time. States that she enjoys writing music, but she struggles to get along with people which interferes with her work. [She endorsed] fluctuating appetite, poor sleep, problems with motivation and concentration ... constant anxiety, restlessness, and worry".  She further stated that she "believes headaches are caused by stress and M[ental] H[ealth] symptoms". In response to a question of whether she had "thoughts that [she] would be better off dead or of hurting herself in some way", the Veteran responded, "several days". VA treatment records reflect that she "would prefer community care mental health" for her psychiatric disability and not at the VA. 

Pursuant to the Veteran's request not to have psychiatric treatment at the VA but in the community, she was provided a referral for mental health care under the Community Care Network (CCN) program. In a VA letter dated May 25, 2022, VA requested the Veteran to provide detailed information regarding any treatment received at a VA "facility or treatment authorized by VA [and to] tell [VA] the dates and places of treatment" so that VA can obtain the necessary records ... [that the Veteran] adequately identif[ies] and authorize[s] VA to obtain". In the representative's June 2022 letter, the representative simply stated that "[i]n response to [VA's] development letter issued May 25, 2022, ... please note that [the Veteran] only receives health care treatment from the VA" and provided no further information as to where, if anywhere, the Veteran received or continued to receive mental health services.

In November 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA psychiatric examination, wherein she reported that she was recently going to counseling through a referral from VA but stopped going in later 2021. As to her psychiatric symptoms, she reported that "she will pull away socially, she does not want to do many things, and she experiences increased irritability when she feels depressed. She has ongoing suspiciousness and anxiety that is worse when she is in public settings. She has trouble going to sleep and staying asleep because she has feelings of hypervigilance throughout the night". She stated that "she will push people away because she has trouble trusting other people. She will procrastinate and sometimes she will not complete necessary tasks". She admitted that "she will lash out verbally toward others when she feels overwhelmed. She described feeling disoriented while driving if she leaves an area that is close to where she lives. She will skip showering and brushing her teeth daily when she feels overwhelmed". She also stated that "she had attempted suicide in 2015 [and] continues to have feelings of hopelessness, but she denied any current plans to harm herself". 

The examiner observed the Veteran "displayed a flattened affect and depressed mood. She was calm and open to discuss her ongoing mental health symptoms. She was casually dressed and appropriately oriented to her surroundings". In evaluating the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms, the examiner noted that for VA rating purposes, the Veteran manifests the following psychiatric symptoms: depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; chronic sleep impairment; flattened affect; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships; suicidal ideation; impaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence; and neglect of personal appearance and hygiene. The examiner noted that the Veteran is capable of managing her own financial affairs. As to the functional impairment caused by the Veteran's psychiatric disability and the effect of that impairment on the Veteran's ability to perform activities of employment, the examiner stated that her "symptoms of stress and anxiety impair her ability to interact with others socially and within work settings. She has ongoing feelings of suspiciousness that make it difficult for her to trust other people. She will lash out toward others verbally during stressful circumstances. She was previously dismissed from a college program because she was missing too many classes. Her increased sense of hypervigilance makes it difficult to get restful sleep and she often feels fatigued throughout the day". After reviewing the medical and lay evidence of record and observing the Veteran, the examiner assessed that the Veteran's overall psychiatric impairment manifested as occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, which is consistent with the assignment of a 50 percent rating under DC 9413.

The Board also notes that a number of the Veteran's reported symptoms are not listed in the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, e.g., difficulty with trusting others; feeling "extremely hopeless, almost like a failure"; procrastination; hypervigilance; and being fatigued after poor sleep.  However, the Board finds these unlisted symptoms more closely approximate the symptoms of anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation and mood, and impairment of short- and long-term memory, which are symptoms associated with the 30 and 50 percent ratings, respectively. 

Although the February 2023 VA examiner's overall assessment of the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's reported psychiatric symptoms was a level of occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, which is contemplated by the 50 percent rating under DC 9413, the February 2023 rating decision increased the Veteran's psychiatric rating from 50 percent to 70 percent. As the AOJ's rating determination in the February 2023 rating decision is more favorable than the November 2022 VA examiner's overall assessment, the Board will not disturb the assigned 70 percent rating. 

However, the Board does not find any evidence of record to support a finding that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms warrant a higher rating of 100 percent. No where in the record is there evidence that the Veteran's psychiatric disability was manifested by symptoms of gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. The Board also does not find the Veteran's reports that she feels disoriented when she drives away from the area around her home to be comparable to the symptom of disorientation to time or place, which the Board interprets to include disorientation of familiar areas, such as around one's home. Furthermore, as to her report that she would skip showering and brushing her teeth daily when she felt overwhelmed, the examiner assessed that such behavior more appropriately fit the criteria of neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, reflective of a 70 percent rating, and not to the level of  intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living as noted in the 100 percent criteria under the General Rating Formula.

With respect to her social impairment, the Board acknowledges that the record is replete with the Veteran's reports of difficulties getting along with people and wanting/needing to socially isolate.  However, the evidence shows the Veteran moved closer to her family to be near them during the period on appeal, and she has not reported an inability to maintain familial relationships.  As for total occupational impairment, the Board herein awards an earlier effective date for a TDIU, but also acknowledges that the evidence indicates the Veteran continued to pursue employment opportunities during the appeal period, evidencing her desire to support herself financially, as well as her ability to manage her own finances. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to report her observable symptoms; however, she is not competent to report that her mental health symptoms are of sufficient severity to warrant a specific rating under VA's tables for rating such disabilities because such an opinion requires medical expertise which she has not been shown to have. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). 

The Board has assessed and considered the medical and lay evidence of record, to include the Veteran's documented behavior and the frequency, intensity, and duration of all her reported psychiatric symptoms, as listed in the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders and in combination with those that are not listed. After considering the effects of her psychiatric disability on her daily life, along with the balance of the record, the Board finds that a rating of 70 percent rating, but not higher, has been approximated throughout the appellate period under review.

The Board finds the effect of symptoms associated with the Veteran's psychiatric disability during the appellate period under review, as explained above, persuasively weighs against a finding a rating higher than 70 percent to warrant the application of the benefit of the doubt doctrine in the Veteran's favor. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 4.3; Gilbert, supra; Lynch, supra. As such, the Board finds her symptoms, specific to her psychiatric disability, most nearly approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas (the 70 percent level). 

Returning to the question of whether an earlier effective date for the 70 percent rating is warranted, the Board finds such to be the case. During the appellate period under review, private treatment records show a worsening of her psychiatric symptoms prior to the currently-assigned effective date. Specifically, in April 2021, private treatment records continued to show the Veteran as in good control psychologically, with reports that she was finishing her college degree, appeared to be doing well and happy, and was appropriately using grounding steps for coping with anxious feelings. However, by May 14, 2021, private counseling treatment records reflect that the Veteran reported an incident where she became so angry that "she lost it". These same records reflect the private therapist's evaluation of the Veteran at an eight out of 10 on both the depression and anxiety scales. The Boards finds this report is significant as it reflects impaired impulse control, which is consistent with a 70 percent rating at that point in time and a symptom documented during the November 2022 VA psychiatric examination. Furthermore, in an August 2021 VA mental health note, the Veteran was noted to have been in school prior to moving to Dallas, Texas, where a professor helped her through school with an associate degree; however, after the move to Dallas, Texas, in June 2021, she had been having difficulty with concentration and reported that she was failing her classes. As such, in light of this evidence and affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds in favor of an earlier effective date of May 14, 2021, but no earlier, for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for her service-connected psychiatric disability. 

In sum, a rating in excess of 70 percent for psychiatric disability is not warranted at any time during the appeal period. However, the evidence supports the assignment of an effective date of May 14, 2021, for the award of the 70 percent rating for her psychiatric disability. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent prior to October 24, 2022, and a compensable rating thereafter for migraines.

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to higher ratings for her migraine disability than those assigned for the period after March 1, 2022. See May 2024 VA Form 10182.

To summarize the procedural history regarding the Veteran's migraine disability, in a March 2019 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection for her migraine headaches, rated at 50 percent, effective December 7, 2018, the date VA received the Veteran's Fully Developed Claim. On March 30, 2021, VA received the Veteran's TDIU claim, and in her VA 21-8940 she asserted that her service-connected migraine disability was the reason for her unemployability. This prompted the AOJ to obtain a VA migraine examination in April 2021 to assess the severity of the Veteran's migraine disability. As a result of the examiner's findings from the April 2021 VA migraine examination, the Veteran's TDIU claim was denied in a May 2021 rating decision and her migraine rating was proposed to be reduced from 50 to 30 percent in a June 2021 rating decision. The reduction to 30 percent was effectuated in a December 2021 rating decision, effective March 1, 2022.  

Thereafter, the Veteran pursued her TDIU claim in a timely submission of an October 2021 Supplemental Claim. Of note, in response to the October 2021 Supplemental Claim, the AOJ stated that the TDIU claim "is considered reopened", thereby acknowledging that new and relevant evidence was received, and then denied the claim on its merits in a July 2022 rating decision. The Veteran then timely submitted an October 2022 Supplemental Claim within one year of the July 2022 rating decision that last denied the TDIU claim. In the February 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ acknowledged receipt of new and relevant evidence with her October 2022 Supplemental Claim and, in its reconsideration of the claims, granted a TDIU but decreased the migraine rating disability from 30 percent to a noncompensable rating. The AOJ staged this noncompensable rating by making it effective October 24, 2022, the date of the last VA migraine examination. Therefore, whether new and relevant evidence was received since the May 2021 rating decision that initially denied a TDIU is not at issue, as the Board accepts the AOJ's favorable finding that such evidence was received. 

The forgoing demonstrates that the continuously pursued chain relating to the Veteran's increased rating claim for her migraine disability has not been broken since it first became an issue with the December 2021 rating decision, which was prompted by her TDIU claim received on March 30, 2021. As such, the appellate period under the Board's review for the higher non-initial rating claim begins on March 30, 2021, with the one-year look back period. 

The Veteran's migraine disability is currently rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100. Under this code, a noncompensable rating is awarded when the disability manifests as having less frequent attacks. A 10 percent rating is granted when it has characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over last several months. A 30 percent rating is warranted for characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months, and the maximum, 50 percent rating, is warranted for very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. In rating headaches or migraines under DC 8100, the Board may not consider the ameliorative or beneficial effects of medication. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).

The Court in Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 67 (2020), held that the criteria of 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100, contemplate more [italicized for emphasis] than merely headache symptoms, and that the DC requires VA to consider all symptoms experienced as a result of migraine attacks, and evaluate those symptoms based on the overall frequency, severity, and economic impact of the migraine attacks.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under DC 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation. Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The rating criteria for a 50 percent rating contains several undefined phrases. The descriptive phrase "very frequent" connotes a frequency at least greater than once a month, as is required by the rating criteria corresponding to the lesser 30 percent rating. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 253 (2018). The phrase "completely prostrating" generally means that the migraines attack must render the veteran entirely powerless. Id. The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract." Id. (internal citation omitted). Lastly, the 50 percent rating criteria requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability." Productive can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in DC 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating. Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445-46 (2004).

The Veteran was afforded a VA headache examination in April 2021. The examiner documented that she reviewed the claims file and restated some of the evidentiary medical history of record. The Veteran reported throbbing headaches three to four times per week, mostly on the right side, with nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound lasting four to five hours, where she sometimes has to lay down for it to pass. The examiner assessed the Veteran and overall record to conclude that her disability manifests as characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/ non-migraine headache pain that happen once every month and that the Veteran does not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability. Such an assessment meets the rating criteria for a 30 percent rating under DC 8100. 

In response to the October 2022 Supplemental Claim for a TDIU received after the Veteran's ItF on August 31, 2022, the Veteran attended a VA headache examination in October 2022. During that VA examination, the Veteran reported that her past treatment included "all kinds of migraine medicines, but nothing worked". Her current treatment plan did not include the taking of medications. She reported current symptoms of multiple migraines a week, confusion, irritability, moodiness, pain, and inability to concentrate. The examiner noted that she did not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability and assessed her disability's severity as characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/ non-migraine headache pain that happen with less frequent attacks, which is notably consistent with a noncompensable rating under DC 8100. The examiner was also asked to assess the severity of the Veteran's migraine disability vis-à-vis her unemployability claim. In response, the examiner described her functional impairment as intermittent headaches with poor concentration.

VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran complained of "occasional headaches". Elsewhere in the VA treatment records, the Veteran also reported headaches three to four times per week in the bilateral temporofrontal region, with some associated with an aura that lasted four to five hours and found sleep as the only efficacious remedy. She also complained of difficulty with her schoolwork due to concentration issues and persistent headaches. She reported dizziness, described as "dizzy spells" every other week that made her fatigued and unsteady, though she denied the room spinning around her and also denied associated nausea or vomiting. She also endorsed constant anxiety, restlessness, and worry and "believes [her] headaches are caused by stress and MH [mental health] symptoms". See August 2021 VA Mental health Note. 

In reviewing the evidence of record, the Board notes that the frequency of migraine attacks documented by the various VA examiners have progressively improved over time. Furthermore, although the Veteran's report of symptoms varies among the 2021 VA treatment records, they remain in line with those reported during the April 2021 VA headache examination.  Such are reflective of the Veteran experiencing "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness" about once per month, as contemplated by the assignment of a 30 percent rating for characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/ non-migraine headache pain that happen once every month. 

Based on the aforementioned, the Board finds that the Veteran's migraine disability was manifested by characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months during the appeal period prior to October 24, 2022, with less frequent attacks thereafter.  Accordingly, a rating in excess of 30 percent prior to October 24, 2022, and a compensable rating thereafter for migraines are denied.

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 31, 2022, for the award of a TDIU.

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to an effective date prior to August 31, 2022, for her awarded TDIU. The procedural history of the Veteran's TDIU claim was set forth earlier in this decision showing that the appellate period under review runs from March 2021, with a one-year look back period. In the February 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ noted that the October 2022 VA examiner did not find that the Veteran's headaches rendered her unemployable. However, in support of the TDIU award, the AOJ referenced the November 2022 VA psychiatric examination and VA treatment records from Dallas, Texas, and determined that the "combination of limitations from [her] unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder with alcohol use disorder have been found to render [her] unemployable". As such, the Veteran was awarded a TDIU based solely on her service-connected psychiatric disability.

A TDIU claim can made in one of two ways. The first way is by a claimant's submission of a VA Form 21-8940. The second is to find that it has been raised by the record in the context of establishing the appropriate rating for a disability, either through the initial rating process or via an increased rating claim.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) (when evidence of unemployability is submitted during the course of an appeal from an assigned disability rating, a claim for entitlement to TDIU will be considered to have been raised by the record as "part and parcel" of the underlying claim). In this case, the Veteran's TDIU claim was initiated by her submitting a VA Form 21-8940 on March 30, 2021.

To be eligible to a TDIU on a schedular basis, there must be one disability evaluated at 60 percent disabling, or two or more disabilities, one of which is rated at 40 percent, with a combined evaluation of 70 percent or more. In addition to the schedular criteria, the record must also show that the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation solely as a result of the service-connected disabilities. Both these requirements must be met to establish entitlement. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

Given that a TDIU is a form of increased rating claim, the effective date rules for increased compensation claims apply. See Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 420 (1999); Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000). The effective date shall be the later of either the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). An effective date for a non-initial claim for an increase (that is, one not in dispute of the rating decision that awarded service connection), may also be granted prior to the date of claim if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred within one year from the date of claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o)(1), (2). Therefore, the ultimate question in determining the effective date for TDIU is when it was factually ascertainable that the service-connected disabilities rendered a veteran unemployable. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126-27 (1997). As with any claim, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any matter material to the claim, the claimant shall be given the benefit of the doubt. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

In the February 2023 rating decision on appeal, the assigned effective date for the Veteran's 70 percent psychiatric rating was August 31, 2022. However, pursuant to this decision, the effective date for the 70 percent rating is May 14, 2021. As such, the Veteran meets the schedular rating for entitlement to a TDIU as of May 14, 2021. Furthermore, the record reflects that the Veteran's symptomatology both increased in severity and was productive of unemployability at that time, and there is no evidence of record to suggest that she was employed at any time since May 14, 2021. Given that the Veteran has been found unemployable due to her psychiatric disability, for which she has now met the schedular rating as of May 14, 2021, she is also entitled to a TDIU from that same date.

In sum, the Board finds an effective date of May 14, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of a TDIU is warranted. 

5. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 31, 2022, for eligibility to DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.

The Veteran requests an effective date earlier than August 31, 2022, for eligibility to DEA. 

Eligibility to a DEA award for a veteran's or serviceperson's child, spouse, or surviving spouse arises when a veteran has a permanent and total service-connected disability; or a permanent and total disability was in existence at the time of the veteran's death; or the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. Also, eligibility exists for a serviceperson who died in service. Eligibility can also arise when a serviceperson has been listed for more than 90 days as: missing in action; captured in line of duty by a hostile force; or forcibly detained or interned in line of duty by a foreign government or power. Lastly, eligibility may also arise when a serviceperson is determined by the VA to have a total disability permanent in nature that was incurred or aggravated in service; is hospitalized or receiving outpatient care for such disability; is likely to be discharged from service due to such disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807. The effective date relating to such an award "shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability". 38 U.S.C. § 5113.

The Veteran did not become eligible for DEA until she was rendered totally disabled for VA purposes due to her service-connected psychiatric disability, upon which she was awarded a TDIU. Since the AOJ in the February 2023 rating decision had made the TDIU award effective August 31, 2022, the effective date for DEA eligibility was made effective that same date. However, given that the Board here has granted an earlier effective date for the TDIU award, effective as of May 14, 2021, similarly, eligibility for a DEA follows the totally disabled rating so that it too is to be made effective May 14, 2021. 

Here, the Board is granting an effective date of May 14, 2021, for the award of a TDIU based on the Veteran's psychiatric disability.  As a result, the Veteran's eligibility for DEA would also arise on that same date and, thus, be awarded the same effective date. In other words, the grant of a "total" disability rating for her psychiatric disability, which is the basis of the TDIU award, rendered her disability as a "permanent total service-connected disability" as contemplated by § 3.807. As such, the effective date for her "permanent total service-connected disability" of May 14, 2021 "corresponds to [the] effective date relating to [the] award of" DEA. 38 U.S.C. § 5113. In short, May 14, 2021, is the earliest date that the Veteran is deemed permanently and totally disabled, as required in order to be eligible for DEA. Id; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Accordingly, an effective date of May 14, 2021, but no earlier, for the grant of basic eligibility to DEA is warranted.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
