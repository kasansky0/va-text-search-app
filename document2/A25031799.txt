ORDER

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral flat feet is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's military service did not aggravate his pre-existing bilateral pes planus.

2. The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss does not qualify as a disability for VA purposes.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral pes planus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1987 to August 1991 and is a Gulf War veteran.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), from a February 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of tinnitus, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes the issues of service connection for bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and bilateral flat feet were adjudicated in a July 2024 decision.  The July 2024 Board decision was in response to a May 2021 VA Form 10182 which appealed a May 2021 rating decision.  This decision at hand is in response to a March 2024 VA Form 10182 which appealed a February 2024 rating decision.  It is important to note the July 2024 Board decision remanded the claim of tinnitus for a new VA examination.  However, the new VA examination was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed for this particular appeal.  As the Board is remanding the claim of tinnitus for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of this claim.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a current disability arising from disease or injury incurred or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110.  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another.  38?C.F.R. § 4.3.  When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b).  When the evidence persuasively favors against the claim of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable and the claim will be denied on its merits.  38?U.S.C. §?5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

1. Service connection for bilateral flat feet is denied.

The Veteran asserts his pre-existing pes planus was aggravated by his military service.

A Veteran who served after December 31, 1946, is presumed to be in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable (obvious and manifest) evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior thereto and was not aggravated by such service.  Only such conditions as are recorded in the examination reports are to be considered as noted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1137; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304.

The presumption of soundness attaches only where there has been an induction examination in which the later complained-of disability was not detected.  See Bagby v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 225, 227 (1991).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b) clarify that the term "noted" denotes "[o]nly such conditions as are recorded in the examination reports" and that "[h]istory of pre-service existence of conditions recorded at the time of examination does not constitute a notation of such conditions."  See Crowe v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 238, 245 (1994); see also Cotant v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 116 (2003).

When no preexisting condition is noted upon entry into service, a Veteran is presumed to have been found sound upon entry.  The burden then falls on the Government to rebut the presumption of soundness by clear and unmistakable (obvious or manifest) evidence that the Veteran's disability was both preexisting and not aggravated (i.e., increased in severity beyond its natural progression) by service.  If this burden is met, then the Veteran is not entitled to service connection benefits.  However, if the Government fails to rebut the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C. § 1111, the Veteran's claim is one for service connection.  See Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran's military entrance exam contains documentation of a bilateral pes planus diagnosis.  See October 2018 STR.  The Veteran does not dispute this pre-existing condition.  See April 2019 NOD.  Therefore, the analysis turns to whether the pre-existing disability was aggravated during/by the Veteran's service.

Aggravation is established by showing an increase in disability (beyond natural progression) during service.  The Veteran's service treatment records do not contain documentation of active or ongoing symptomatology involving his bilateral pes planus during the Veteran's military service.  In 1988, the Veteran asserted he had excellent health with no feet issues.  See October 2018 STR.  In 1991, the Veteran also asserted he had good health with no feet problems in his separation exam.  Id.  The Veteran's post-military medical records are silent as to symptomatology regarding his bilateral pes planus.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2021.  The examiner noted the Veteran's diagnosis of bilateral pes planus prior to entering the military.  See May 2021 C&P Exam.  The examiner assessed the Veteran to not have pain during weight-bearing, active, or passive motion, nor did he have flareups or functional loss due to his bilateral pes planus.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that the military caused his bilateral pes planus to worsen; however, this contention is not supported by the medical evidence of record.  The Veteran asserted in his separation exam that he was in good health with no feet issues.  Additionally, the examiner noted the Veteran did not have issues with his bilateral pes planus upon separation.  The Veteran's service records also include a September 29, 1992 medical examination for the Veteran's enlistment into the National Guard.  See October 2018 STR.  At that time "mild" asymptomatic pes planus was noted.  The Veteran's medical records after separation do not contain evidence of symptomatology or treatment for this condition.

As there is no favorable, competent, and probative medical opinion to the contrary, the competent and probative evidence persuasively weighs against the claim; the benefit of the doubt rule is therefore inapplicable to this claim.  See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  Service connection for bilateral pes planus must be denied.

2. Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

For VA compensation purposes, impaired hearing will be considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels, and higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss.  See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2020.  Pure tone thresholds in decibels were as follows:

	HERTZ

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15	15	15	15	20

LEFT	10	10	10	10	10

The Veteran's speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test were 94 percent in the right ear and 96 percent in the left ear.  See November 2020 C&P Exam.  Based on the objective audiometric test results, the Veteran does not have hearing loss in either ear consistent with VA disability standards.  The VA exam did not show an auditory threshold of 40 decibels or greater in any frequency, auditory thresholds of 26 decibels or higher for three frequencies, or a Maryland CNC Test score of less than 94 percent for either ear.  Id.  Thus, the first element of service connection (i.e., a current disability) has not been satisfied.

A current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation and in the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  As such, service connection for bilateral hearing loss disability must be denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

As noted above, this appeal at hand is in response to a March 2024 VA Form 10182 which appealed a February 2024 rating decision.  It is important to note the July 2024 Board decision remanded the claim of tinnitus for a new VA examination.  However, the new VA examination was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed for this particular appeal.  As the Board is remanding the claim of tinnitus for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of this claim.

The Veteran contends he has tinnitus due to the hazardous noise he was exposed to in the military.  See July 2018 VA Form 21-4138 and April 2019 NOD.  Tinnitus is a disability that is diagnosed based on self-reports (by the person experiencing it) and is generally incapable of objective confirmation.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002) ("ringing in the ears is capable of lay observation").  In a November 2020 VA examination, the examiner stated the Veteran did not report recurrent tinnitus and therefore did not provide a nexus opinion for this condition.  See November 2020 C&P Exam.  It is not in dispute that the Veteran was exposed to considerable noise during service.

Considering the consistency of the Veteran's lay statements, his exposure to hazardous noise while in active duty, and the inadequacy of the 2020 VA examination, the Board finds there was a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand is necessary for an addendum opinion.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a VA addendum opinion from an appropriate examiner to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's tinnitus.  The record must be made available to the examiner for review, (including a copy of this Remand) and the examiner should indicate that the record was reviewed in connection with the examination.

The examiner should provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's tinnitus was caused by, incurred in, or is otherwise related to his active service.

A detailed rationale supporting the examiner's opinion should be provided.  In forming the opinion, the examiner must consider all lay statements of record.  (By law, the Board is not permitted to rely on any conclusion that is not supported by a thorough explanation.  Providing an opinion or conclusion without a thorough explanation will delay processing of the claim and may also result in a clarification being requested).

If the examiner believes that the requested opinions cannot be rendered without resorting to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is caused by a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (i.e., no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), by a deficiency in the record (i.e., additional facts are required) or the examiner does not have the needed knowledge or training.
