DOCKET NO. 240423-434810
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of October 24, 2021, but not earlier, for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran filed a claim for TDIU that was received by VA on October 24, 2022.  It is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within the one-year period prior to the receipt of the TDIU claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of October 24, 2021, but not earlier, for the award of individual unemployability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1976 to May 1978.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2024 for the Veteran's claimed, TDIU and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

By way of procedural background, in November 2023, the Veteran filed a request for higher level review seeking review of the November 2023 rating decision. Following the high-level review decision in April 2024, in an April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

Direct review is the appeal option to the Board in which a Board decision is issued based on evidence of record at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a Board hearing or accept into the record additional evidence in its direct review.

Laws and Regulations

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the award of TDIU.  The current effective date is October 24, 2022.

Generally, the effective date of an award for an increased evaluation is either the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  However, if an intent to file a claim is submitted to VA on a prescribed form, and if VA receives the complete prescribed application form within one year of receipt of the intent to file, VA will consider the claim filed as of the date that the intent to file was received.  See Jernigan v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 220 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

A TDIU is considered part and parcel of pending increased rating claims and can potentially be granted an effective date back to the date of claim of the pending increased rating claims.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

Additionally, an earlier effective date for a TDIU is possible if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within the one-year period prior to the receipt of the TDIU claim or pending increased rating claims.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  Prior to March 24, 2015, any communication indicating an intent to apply for benefits may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim had not been filed, an application form would be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If the complete form was received within 1 year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it would be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

Prior to March 24, 2015

The Board has reviewed the evidence to determine whether any submitted communication prior to March 24, 2015, indicated an intent to apply for entitlement to a TDIU.  However, no document submitted prior to March 24, 2015, indicated an intent to pursue a claim of entitlement to a TDIU.  Additionally, 38 C.F.R. § 3.157 (in effect prior to March 24, 2015), is not applicable.  Although medical records received prior to March 24, 2015, documented unemployability due to disabilities that have since been granted service connection, such medical records do not constitute a claim for a TDIU as no intent to file a claim was noted.  See Criswell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 501 (2006).

VA must interpret a claimant's submissions broadly; however, VA is not required to "conjure up" issues not raised by the claimant.  VA is not required to anticipate any potential claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed.  See Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352 (1995).

Therefore, the Board finds that no TDIU claim was received prior to March 24, 2015.

From March 24, 2015

The Veteran's claim does not state anything about the existence of pending or unadjudicated increased rating claims dated prior to October 24, 2022, or anything to do with ratings at all.  The Veteran's claim specifically stated the issue as, "Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of Individual Unemployability."  Moreover, an April 2024 statement supporting the Veteran's claim from the Veteran's representative, spoke only to the effective date assigned for service connection, not the ratings assigned.

Therefore, the Board finds that as there are no pending or unadjudicated increased rating claims for the TDIU issue to be part and parcel of dated prior to October 24, 2022, an earlier effective date based on pending, or prior unadjudicated increased rating claims is not available.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of October 24, 2021, but not earlier, for the award of TDIU is granted.

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran has identified a May 1, 2018, as the earlier effective date that should be assigned.

The Board notes that the Veteran was awarded a 70 percent rating for his generalized anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder associated with right wrist fracture distal ulna with degenerative arthritis and chronic wrist sprain disability effective from April 5, 2018.

On October 24, 2022, a formal claim for a TDIU was received by VA indicating that the Veteran was unable to work due to his service-connected disabilities.  This is the earliest date that a claim for a TDIU occurred.  TDIU was subsequently granted in a November 2023 rating decision with an effective date of October 24, 2022, the date that the TDIU claim was received by VA.

An earlier effective date would be warranted if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within the one-year period prior to the receipt of the TDIU claim. 

In this regard, the Board finds that it is factually ascertainable that an overall increase in the severity of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities occurred within one year of receipt of the October 24, 2022, TDIU claim.  Specifically, the evidence suggests that the Veteran's generalized anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder associated with right wrist fracture distal ulna with degenerative arthritis and chronic wrist sprain substantially limit his ability to maintain employment.  The record shows the Veteran retired due to his service-connected disabilities and remained unemployed. 

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities from October 24, 2021. 

Accordingly, entitlement to an earlier effective date of October 24, 2021, but no earlier, for the grant of a TDIU is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); Gaston, 605 F.3d at 982.
