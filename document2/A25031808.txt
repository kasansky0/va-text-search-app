ORDER

An initial 30 percent rating, but no higher, for migraines is granted.

An initial 30 percent rating, but no higher, for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is granted.

A compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's migraine headaches are manifested by headaches, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and sleep disturbance; very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability are not shown.

2. During the appeal period, the Veteran's GERD manifested as persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphasia and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal pain, productive of considerable impairment of health; but does not more nearly approximate symptoms of material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

3. The Veteran's allergic rhinitis does not manifest with polyps, nor is there greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial 30 percent evaluation, but no higher, for migraine headaches are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.3, 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100.

2. The criteria for an initial 30 percent disability rating, but no higher, for service-connected GERD are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.14, 4.21, 4.114, DC 7346.

3. The criteria for a compensable evaluation for allergic rhinitis are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.14, 4.97, DC 6522

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Navy on active duty from April 2002 to April 2010. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of, or incident to, military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991). If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. After consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, and the evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses, are to be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, evaluation of the medical evidence since the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of a "staged rating" (assignment of different ratings for distinct periods of time, based on the facts found) is required. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). Where an increase in the level of a service-connected disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges that a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

1. Migraines

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for his service-connected migraine headaches pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100. 

Under Diagnostic Code 8100, a 10 percent rating is warranted where there is evidence of characteristic prostrating attacks due to migraines that average one every two months lasting over several months. A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months. A maximum 50 percent rating is warranted for very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100.

In determining whether the Veteran experiences the type and frequency of prostrating attacks of headaches necessary for a higher rating under Diagnostic Code 8100, the Board observes that the rating criteria do not define "prostrating." However, the Court, in Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018) took it upon itself to settle on a definition of prostrating as "lacking in vitality or will: powerless to rise: laid low." Id. The Court defined "completely prostrating" as the headaches must render the veteran entirely powerless. Id. The Board adopts this definition.

As for the term "productive of severe economic adaptability," the Court adopted VA's definition of the terms as meaning either producing or capable of producing severe economic inadaptability. Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445 (2004). Headaches need not actually "produce" severe economic inadaptability to warrant the 50 percent rating. Id. at 445-46. "Economic inadaptability" does not mean unemployability, as such would undermine the purpose of regulations pertaining to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability. Id. at 446; 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. At a minimum, however, headaches must be capable of producing "severe" economic inadaptability.

Turning to the facts of this case, at the August 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported experiencing headaches regularly since having a cyst on the back of his head drained in service, for which he takes pain medication. In addition to constant head pain on both sides of the head, the Veteran also experienced sleep disturbances, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and vomiting. His typical migraines last one to two days. The examiner found that the Veteran experienced characteristic prostrating attacks of migraines with less frequent attacks; however, he did not have very prostrating or prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. In terms of functional impact, the Veteran reported that when he gets migraines he cannot function or focus. See August 2023 Headaches (Including Migraine Headaches) Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

A VA treatment record from December 2022 shows that the Veteran complained of chronic bad headaches 1-2 times per week with difficulty sleeping, light sensitivity, and nausea. See January 2023 CAPRI Record, page 24, 28. 

In a January 2023 correspondence, the Veteran reported that the pain and lack of sleep from his migraines causes fatigue and prevents him from performing 100 percent at his job. See January 2023 Correspondence. 

After a careful review of the record, the Board finds that a 30 percent evaluation, but no higher, is warranted throughout the appeal period. Specifically, the Veteran's headaches were shown by the August 2023 examiner to be prostrating. In December 2022, the Veteran reported having 1-2 headaches per week.  Although the VA examiner specified that the headaches more closely matched the criteria for a noncompensable rating based on "less frequent attacks", the Board has no reason to doubt the frequency reported by the Veteran and resolves reasonable doubt in his favor. Accordingly, by resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that an initial 30 percent evaluation throughout the appeal period is warranted in this case.

However, a 50 percent evaluation contemplates very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124 (a), DC 8100. 

With respect to the severity of his migraine attacks, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran describes, and the evidence supports, persistent headaches manifest by pain, nausea, vomiting, sleep disturbance, and sensitivity to light. In addition, the evidence shows prostrating attacks occurring multiple times per month. These facts are consistent with a 30 percent evaluation under the ratings criteria. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124 (a), DC 8100. However, the weight of the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of completely prostrating and prolonged migraine attacks at any time during the appeal period.

The rating criteria for DC 8100 link the ratings for migraine headaches to two elements: severity and frequency. It is not sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a particular frequency of headaches; the headaches must be of a specific prostrating character. While the Veteran reported that he cannot function and cannot focus when he gets a headache, there is nothing to suggest that each time he experienced a headache, it was of such severity as to render him "completely lacking in vitality or will" and "powerless to rise," which is defined by the words "completely prostrating."  Indeed, during this period, no clinician found that the Veteran had completely prostrating attacks of migraine or that his headaches caused functional impairment, impacted his ability to work, or were otherwise productive of severe economic inadaptability. To the extent that the Veteran asserts that his headaches were of such severity as to be completely prostrating attacks of headache pain productive of severe economic inadaptability, the Board finds that his assertions are outweighed by the medical evidence of record. 

Additionally, while the Board acknowledges that the Veteran took medication to control his headache symptoms, the evidence does not demonstrate additional symptomatology that would substantiate a 50 percent rating without medication. In other words, the evidence, lay and medical, does not suggest that his headaches rendered him entirely powerless due to headache pain whether taking medication or not. Thus, based on the competent evidence, the Veteran's migraine headaches did not occur with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

Accordingly, the Board finds, while the record reflects that the Veteran experienced regular attacks of headache pain, there is simply no evidence of record to indicate that his headaches were completely prostrating in nature and had produced or were capable of producing severe economic inadaptability.

In reaching the above conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine and applied it where appropriate. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. GERD

The Veteran seeks a rating higher than 10 percent for his GERD.

The Board notes that during the pendency of the appeal, VA published amendments to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, the Schedule of Ratings for the Digestive System, effective May 19, 2024. If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g). If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. 38 U.S.C. § 5110.

Prior to May 19, 2024, GERD was rated analogous to hiatal hernia under DC 7346. Under Diagnostic Code 7346, A 10 percent rating is warranted where there are two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation present with less severity, a 30 percent evaluation is warranted when there is persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphasia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. A 60 percent evaluation contemplates a level of impairment which includes symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346.

Additionally, stricture of the esophagus was evaluated under DC 7203 which assigned a 30 percent rating for moderate stricture of the esophagus and a 50 percent rating for severe stricture, permitting liquids only. An 80 percent rating is warranted for stricture of the esophagus permitting passage of liquids only, with marked impairment of general health.

Under the amended criteria, a new diagnostic code (DC 7206) was added for GERD, which provides the same rating criteria as DC 7203 for stricture of the esophagus. Under the new DCs 7203 and 7206 for GERD/esophageal stricture, a noncompensable evaluation is assigned for documented history without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications. A 30 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year. A 50 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement. A maximum 80 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube).

Descriptive words such as "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe" and "severe" are not defined in the Rating Schedule. As with any regulatory interpretation where the terms are not defined in the regulation, we presume those terms carry their ordinary dictionary meaning. See Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 336 (2018). The Board finds that these terms are unambiguous and, therefore, a plain dictionary meaning is an appropriate definition.  Cf. Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2415 (2019); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.6 (noting, in general, the Board does not evaluate evidence by applying a mechanical formula, but rather conscientiously to the end that its decisions are equitable and just).  According to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 999 (11th Ed. 2007), "mild" means gentle in nature or temperate.  "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect or average in amount, intensity, quality, or degree.  The term "moderately severe" includes impairment that is considered more than "moderate" but not to the extent as to be considered "severe."  Webster's New World Dictionary (2nd ed. 1999), 1012.  "Severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree.  "Considerable" is defined as "large in extent or degree."  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267 (11th ed. 2012).  Although a medical examiner's use of descriptive terminology such as "mild" is an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, it is not dispositive of an issue.  The Board must evaluate all evidence in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.  

After review of the record, the Board finds that the old criteria in place prior to May 2024 is more favorable to the Veteran and therefore, the Board will no longer discuss the amended criteria in this case.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran was afforded a VA medical examination in August 2023. The examiner noted that his condition started in 2004 on active duty, but his symptoms have gotten worse over the years. The Veteran reported taking Omeprazole and not being able to eat certain things. The examiner noted his current symptoms include persistently recurrent epigastric distress, reflux, regurgitation, nausea, and vomiting. No hematemesis and no melena with moderate anemia was noted. See August 2023 Esophageal Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire. 

In a January 2023 correspondence, the Veteran stated that he constantly has acid reflux and heartburn and that he has severe stomach pains. He reported that his symptoms cause sleep disturbance, because he wakes several times per night with vomiting and hot flashes in his chest. See January 2023 Correspondence.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the criteria for a 30 percent disability rating under DC 7346 are more nearly approximated. Specifically, the evidence reflects the Veteran's GERD is manifested by persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, regurgitation, and nausea, accompanied by substernal pain. Further, he has difficulty sleeping. In light of such symptoms, the Board finds a 30 percent disability rating is warranted for the entire appeal period. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.114, DC 7346.

The Board also has considered whether a higher evaluation is warranted. In this regard, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted, as the evidence of record does not demonstrate any material weight loss, hematemesis, melena, or other symptoms productive of severe impairment of health. The Veteran's symptoms are shown to manifest as nausea, vomiting, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, and sleep disturbance.

The Board specifically notes the lack of any findings of material weight loss, hematemesis, melena or moderate anemia in this case; nor did the examiner, who examined the Veteran and reviewed the file, find that the Veteran's symptoms resulted in either considerable or severe impairment of health. The Board finds that these findings (or lack thereof) are significant and probative.

In short, the medical evidence in this case more closely approximates to the 30 percent criteria. Accordingly, a 30 percent evaluation, but no higher, for GERD are met throughout the appeal period. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.114, DC 7346. In so reaching that conclusion, the Board has appropriately applied the benefit of the doubt doctrine in this case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

3. Allergic Rhinitis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a compensable rating for his service-connected allergic rhinitis.

For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's allergic rhinitis is rated as noncompensable, under DC 6522.

Under DC 6522, allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side warrants a 10 percent rating. Allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps results in a maximum 30 percent rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6522.

In March 2023, a sinus CT imaging study revealed a prominent retention cyst or polyp in the right maxillary sinus. See March 2023 Radiology Report.

In a March 2023 VA examination, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with allergic rhinitis and retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. The examiner reported that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis did not result in polyps, nor was there a greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. The examiner noted there was permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates. The examiner also noted the Veteran's symptoms interfered with yard work to the point where has difficulty focusing when symptoms are severe. See March 2023 Sinusitis/Rhinitis and Other Conditions of the Nose, Throat, Larynx, and Pharynx Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that a compensable disability rating is not warranted for the Veteran's allergic rhinitis. First, the evidence clearly demonstrates that the Veteran does not have any nasal polyps, nor is there evidence of greater than 50 percent obstruction on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. While the March 2023 sinus CT imaging study revealed right maxillary sinus mucous retention cyst/or polyp, upon examination of the Veteran, the VA examiner clarified that the Veteran had a retention cyst, not a polyp, and did not find 50 percent obstruction on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  

(Continued on the next page)

?

Regarding whether the mucous retention cysts are "functionally equivalent" to nasal polyps, the competent medical evidence shows that the Veteran's mucous retention cyst does not result in the same type of complaints including unilateral or bilateral obstruction that a polyp would.

In sum, the Board finds that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis has not resulted in polyps, nor greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, nor complete obstruction on one side. Accordingly, entitlement to a compensable disability rating for allergic rhinitis is denied. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.97, DC 6522. In reaching the above conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776; Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
