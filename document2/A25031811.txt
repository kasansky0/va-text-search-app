CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to March 20, 2019 for the award of SMC based on aid and attendance status are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114 (l); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.352(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1979 to December 1979.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2023 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)'s decision on their claim to seek review.  This decision has been written consistent with the AMA framework.

Applicable Evidentiary Window

In the January 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted an effective date of March 20, 2019 for the award of SMC based on aid and attendance status.  The Veteran appealed the January 2023 rating decision by filing a February 2023 VA Form 10182, in which he requested a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge.  A Board hearing was scheduled for October 28, 2024.  In correspondence received on July 24, 2024, the Veteran requested to cancel the scheduled Board hearing.  As such, the Board's decision will be based on a review of evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's November 28, 2022 rating decision, and evidence submitted by the Veteran or Veteran's representative within 90 days following the receipt of the withdrawal, which is October 22, 2024.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).

If additional evidence was submitted between the date of the AOJ decision and the date the hearing request was withdrawn, the Board will not consider it unless it is resubmitted during the 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal request.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 20, 2019 for the grant of entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance status is denied.

The Veteran contends that the effective date for SMC based on aid and attendance status should be 2017, rather than 2019.  See February 2023 VA Form 10182; March 2024 Appellant's Brief.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l), SMC is warranted when a Veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet, or of one hand and one foot, or is blind in both eyes, with 5/200 visual acuity or less, or is permanently bedridden or with such significant disabilities as to be in need of regular aid and attendance. 

Prior to March 20, 2019, the Veteran was not service-connected for any disability.  As such, he did not have a service-connected disability that caused him to be permanently bedridden or in need of regular aid and attendance prior to March 20, 2019.  Therefore, SMC based on aid and attendance as a result of a service-connected disability was not possible prior to March 20, 2019.  Accordingly, an effective date prior to March 20, 2019 for the grant of entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance is denied.
