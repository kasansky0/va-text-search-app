Entitlement to a clothing allowance for the year 2019 due to the use of forearm crutches, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record is in approximate balance regarding whether the Veteran's right knee brace used for his service-connected right knee disability tended to cause wear and tear to his clothing.

2. The evidence of record is in approximate balance regarding whether the Veteran's forearm crutches used for his service-connected knee, ankle, and instability disabilities tended to cause wear and tear to his clothing.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for establishing entitlement to a clothing allowance for the year 2019 due to the use of a right knee brace, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1162, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.810.

2. The criteria for establishing entitlement to a clothing allowance for the year 2019 due to the use of forearm crutches, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1162, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.810.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from December 1969 to July 1972 .

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2019 determination from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

In July 2020, the Veteran disagreed with the abovementioned decision and filed a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)).  The Veteran selected the Evidence Review Lane under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d).  Accordingly, the Board is limited to review of the evidence in the record at the time of the notice for the decision on appeal and the evidence submitted up to 90 days after the Veteran's VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the above claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  

Clothing Allowance-Legal Criteria

The law provides for payment of an annual clothing allowance for each veteran who, because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, such as a wheelchair, which VA determines tends to wear out or tear the clothing or uses prescribed medication for a service-connected skin disability which causes irreparable damage to the outer garments.  38 U.S.C. § 1162.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.810, a veteran is found to be eligible for an annual clothing allowance when (i) A VA examination or VA medical report establishes that the veteran, because of a service-connected disability due to loss or loss of use of a hand or foot uses a qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance which tends to wear or tear clothing; (ii) The Under Secretary for Health or a designee certifies that a veteran, because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance which tends to wear or tear clothing; or (iii) The Under Secretary for Health or a designee certifies that a veteran, because of a service-connected disability, uses medication prescribed by a physician for a skin condition that causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer garments.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1).  When such determinations are appealed to the Board, the Board can serve as the VHA designee to adjudicate whether a clothing allowance is warranted.

A second clothing allowance is available for a single type of garment if a veteran uses more than one prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, medication for more than one skin condition, or an appliance and a medication, and the appliances or medications (i) satisfy the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1); and (ii) together tend to wear or tear a single garment or irreparably damage a type of outer garment at an increased rate of damage to the clothing due to a second appliance or medication.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(3).

An additional clothing allowance is available for each prosthetic, orthopedic appliance, or medication used by a veteran if it (i) satisfies the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1); and (ii) affects a distinct type of article of clothing or outer garment.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(2).

Clothing Allowance-Analysis

At the outset, the Board notes the essential facts of the Veteran's claims for entitlement to a clothing allowance for his right knee brace and forearm crutches are essentially identical.  In addition, the resolution of these claims involves the application of identical law to similar facts.  As such, in the interest of judicial economy these issues will be addressed together.

The Veteran has asserted that he is entitled to a clothing allowance for the year of 2019 due to the use of a right knee brace and forearm crutches for his service-connected right knee, left ankle, and instability disabilities.

The Veteran has been service-connected for residual instability, right patellectomy, since 1972; degenerative joint disease of the right knee since 1999, and left ankle fracture since 1972.  See April 2006 Rating Decision Codesheet.  VHA appliance records reflect that the Veteran was provided with forearm crutches since 2003 and a right knee brace since at least 2014.  Further, the evidence indicates that the Veteran had been awarded a clothing allowance for his right knee brace and forearm crutches since at least 2013.

The October 2019 VHA decision denied the claims for a clothing allowance because the Veteran's right knee brace was issued in 2014 with no clinical evidence to support continued need, nor repairs or replacement to support continued use.  The Veteran's forearm crutches were noted to be issued in 2003 with no repairs or replacement parts issued in the past 6 years to support continued use/need.  See October 2019 VHA Denial Letter.

Essentially, to justify the denial of the Veteran's claims, the VAMC's Prosthetics Representatives surmised that based on the age of the knee brace and crutches the continued frequent use of these devices would have required a replacement or the repair of the crutches/braces, and no records of such are apparently available in the evidence of record.  However, contrary to this point, the controlling regulation pertaining to clothing allowance does not require that an appliance or device be any certain age or be replaced/repaired at any certain interval; it is enough that the appliance or device being used for treatment of a service-connected disability tends to cause wear and tear to clothing.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810 (a).  

The Board notes that there is nothing in the VHA Handbook 1173.15 which makes any mention of the age of any orthopedic appliance or device.  Even if the VHA Handbook advised that the age of the device/appliance was to be considered, the Board is not bound by the VHA Handbook.  See 38 C.F.R. § 19.5 (stating that "[t]he Board is not bound by Department manuals, circulars, or similar administrative issues").  Moreover, as a layperson, the Veteran has competently and credibly reported that he has taken good care of his equipment and has not needed to obtain a replacement from the VA.  See July 2020 Statement in Support of Claim; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307-09 (2007).  In other words, the Veteran maintains his knee brace and crutches himself and keeps them in good working order.  The Veteran should not be punished by VA for the commendable initiative on his part to upkeep his knee brace and forearm crutches.

The Board finds that a clothing allowance is warranted in 2019 due to the use of the Veteran's right knee brace and forearm crutches.  The Veteran's VHA and VA treatment records reflect that he wears a right knee brace and uses forearm crutches for his service-connected knee, ankle, and instability disabilities.  The Veteran is competent to observe damage caused to clothing by the crutches/braces, and the Board finds no reason to doubt the Veteran's credibility in this matter.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  The evidence also indicates the Veteran previously received a clothing allowance for the knee brace and forearm crutches.

Thus, weighing the lack of a specific finding of lack of wear and tear on the clothing against the Veteran's specific, competent lay assertion to the contrary, the Board finds the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's right knee brace and forearm crutches caused wear and tear to his clothing in 2019.  Accordingly, entitlement to a clothing allowance for the year 2019 due to the use of a right knee brace and forearm crutches is granted.
