REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability, to include as due to toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), is remanded.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran honorably served on active duty in the United States Air Force from December 1981 to August 1989, January 1990 to July 1990, and January 1991 to August 1991, including in Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War.  

This matter initially came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2020 rating decision which, in pertinent part, denied service connection for right shoulder re-injury.  

In a November 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran appealed the August 2020 decision and selected a Direct Review docket.  

In May 2024, the Board denied the claim for service connection for a right shoulder condition.  The Veteran appealed the Board's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  

In November 2024, the Court set aside the Board's May 2024 decision denying service connection for a right shoulder disability and remanded the issue to the Board for readjudication in compliance with the directives specified.  

Service connection for a right shoulder disability.  

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the claimant under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

In this case, the parties to the Joint Motion agreed that the VA committed an error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty by not ensuring that the Veteran had been provided with notice of her right to a pre-decisional hearing before the AOJ's issuance of the August 2020 decision on appeal, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1).  Therefore, the parties to the Joint Motion found that a remand was necessary for the Board to remand appellant's claim to the AOJ pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) with instructions to provide appellant with notice of her right to a hearing on the claim before the AOJ.  The Board is therefore remanding this claim, pursuant to and consistent with these instructions.
