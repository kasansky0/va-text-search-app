ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of August 27, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for bladder cancer is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of September 23, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A November 2020 Board of Veterans' Appeals decision conceded that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents due to his service in Thailand, specifically, due to his service near the perimeter of Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base and at Camp Friendship, on a facts-found basis. 

2. VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, in which he claimed service connection for bladder cancer due to exposure to Agent Orange, on August 27, 2021.

3. VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, in which he claimed service connection for diabetes mellitus type II due to exposure to Agent Orange, on September 23, 2021. 

4. A February 2023 rating decision established entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer and diabetes mellitus type II due to herbicide agent exposure under the Sergeant First Class Health Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act).

5. Because the Veteran's herbicide agent exposure was conceded prior to the PACT Act, and the fact that the Veteran's claimed disabilities are diseases associated with exposure to herbicide agents, the Veteran's bladder cancer and diabetes mellitus type II could have been service connected on a presumptive basis before the enactment of the PACT Act.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of August 27, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for bladder cancer have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1116, 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of September 23, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1116, 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1967 to October 1970.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a February 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran timely submitted his VA Form 10182: Notice of Disagreement (NOD) in February 2025, and now appeals the February 2024 rating decision.  In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  See February 2025 VA Form 10182.

By way of background, in February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2023 decision.  In February 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2023 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for SMC at the housebound rate, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Finally, the Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), in which the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2).  In the present appeal, the Veteran waived any remaining time he had to modify his NOD.  Williams, 37 Vet. App. at 305.  Given the Veteran's waiver, he is not prejudiced by the Board issuing this decision without delay.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c).

1. Entitlement to an effective date of August 27, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for bladder cancer is granted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of September 23, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II is granted.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to an effective date of August 27, 2021 for service connection for bladder cancer and an effective date of September 23, 2021 for service connection for diabetes mellitus type II due to Agent Orange exposure during his service in Thailand.  See February 2025 VA Form 10182.  The Veteran's asserted effective dates are prior to the August 10, 2022 effective date for claims granted under the PACT Act.  See August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ and September 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

For the reasons discussed below, the Board agrees with the Veteran's assertions.

Procedural Background

The Veteran's military personnel record and DD-214 show that the Veteran had service in Thailand.  See DD-214; see also Military Personnel Record.

The Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents was conceded in a November 2020 Board decision based on his service in Thailand at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base and at Camp Friendship.  See November 2020 Board Decision.

VA treatment records show that the Veteran's bladder cancer was an "active problem" from December 2020.  See VA Treatment Records.  VA treatment records also reflect that the Veteran was "recently [diagnosed] with diabetes" in June 2021.  Id.

Subsequently, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for bladder cancer due to Agent Orange (AO) exposure.  See August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The next month, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus type II due to AO exposure.  See September 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer and diabetes mellitus was granted in a February 2023 rating decision pursuant to the PACT Act.  Entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate was also granted.  As the foregoing claims were granted pursuant to the PACT Act, the effective date for each claim was August 10, 2022.  See February 2023 Rating Decision.

In February 2024, the Veteran requested HLR of the effective date of service connection for bladder cancer and diabetes mellitus type II, along with the effective date of SMC.  See February 2024 VA Form 20-0996.

The AOJ denied the Veteran's claims for an earlier effective date on the basis that the claims were granted pursuant to the PACT Act, meaning that the AOJ found that August 10, 2022 was the earliest possible effective date.  See February 2024 Rating Decision.

In February 2025, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, appealing the February 2024 decision.  See February 2025 VA Form 10182.

Legal Principles

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection, is the date of receipt of a claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

Regarding the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, on a "facts found" basis.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).  These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before they had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested.  Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the RO receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers.  McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

In determining whether an earlier effective date for service connection is warranted, the Board shall consider the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1991).

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for certain diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents, even though there is no record of such disease during service in a veteran who had active military, naval, air, or space service, during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, in the Republic of Vietnam, including the waters offshore, and other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in Vietnam.  38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(e)(c), 3.313.  This presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C. § 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. 

Generally, certain diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents used in support of military operations in the Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) during the Vietnam era will be considered to have been incurred in service.  38 U.S.C. § 1116 (a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6).

On August 10, 2022, the President of the United States signed the PACT Act into law, which extends a presumption of service connection for diseases associated with exposures to certain herbicide agents for veterans who performed active military, naval, air, or space service in Thailand at any United States or Royal Thai base during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on June 30, 1976, without regard to where on the base the veteran was located or what military job specialty the veteran performed.  See PACT Act, Pub. L. No 117-168, § 403(d)(2) (2022); see also 38 U.S.C. § 1116, as amended by Public Law 117-168.  Claims granted under the PACT Act are effective no earlier than August 10, 2022, the date of enactment of the Act.  An effective date prior to August 10, 2022 may be warranted if the grant is based on another theory of entitlement.

Finally, if, prior to the enactment of the PACT Act, a Veteran had service in Thailand with duties that placed him on or near the perimeters of Thailand military bases, his exposure to herbicide agents could be established on a facts-found basis. 

Analysis

Here, the Veteran's original claims for bladder cancer and diabetes mellitus type II were due to in-service exposure to AO on a direct basis.  See August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ and September 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Prior to the February 2023 rating decision that granted service connection for bladder cancer and diabetes mellitus type II pursuant to the PACT Act, herbicide exposure was established on a facts-found basis by the Board.  See November 2020 Board Decision.  The Board is bound by that earlier favorable finding of fact.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Further, the list of diseases presumptively associated with exposure to herbicide agents includes bladder cancer and diabetes mellitus type II.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), (d), 3.309(e).  In other words, a nexus between the Veteran's bladder cancer and diabetes mellitus type II and conceded exposure to herbicide agents is presumed.  Id. 

While the PACT Act was a liberalizing law for establishing presumptive herbicide agent exposure for Veterans who served in Thailand, herbicide agent exposure could be established on a facts-found basis for such Veterans before the PACT Act went into effect.  As established, the Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents was conceded in November 2020.  His claimed disabilities, bladder cancer and diabetes mellitus type II, are enumerated diseases associated with exposure to herbicide agents.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), (d), 3.309(e).  Therefore, the Veteran's bladder cancer and diabetes mellitus type II should have been service connected irrespective of the change in law under the PACT Act, entitling him to earlier effective dates for both disabilities. 

As discussed, the effective date is the date of VA receipt of the claim for service connection, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  VA received the Veteran's claim for bladder cancer on August 27, 2021 and diabetes mellitus type II on September 23, 2021.  The record reflects that the Veteran was already diagnosed with both disabilities before VA received his claims.  See VA Treatment Records.  The effective dates are therefore the dates of VA's receipt of the Veteran's claims, later than the date entitlement arose for each disability.

Accordingly, entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 27, 2021 for the grant of service connection for bladder cancer, and September 23, 2021 for the grant of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II, is warranted.  The Veteran's claims are hereby GRANTED.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1116, 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for SMC at the housebound rate is remanded.

Based on the earlier effective dates granted above, the Board finds that the issue of an earlier effective date for the grant of SMC at the housebound rate is inextricably intertwined with the AOJ's evaluation of the Veteran's service-connected bladder cancer from August 27, 2021 to August 10, 2022 and diabetes mellitus type II from September 23, 2021 to August 10, 2022.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. After determining the Veteran's evaluation for service connection for bladder cancer from August 27, 2021 to August 10, 2022, and evaluation for service connection for diabetes mellitus type II from September 23, 2021 to August 10, 2022, readjudicate the inextricably intertwined issue of an earlier effective date for SMC housebound.
