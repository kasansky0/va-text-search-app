ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of July 29, 2021, for the 30 percent disability rating assigned for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 29, 2021, for the 30 percent rating assigned for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In May 2020, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service-connected compensation for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with an initial disability rating of 10 percent, effective February 23, 2018; the AOJ notified the Veteran of its May 2020 decision by mailing a copy to his residence.  

2. During the 12 months after the AOJ notified him of the May 2020 decision, the Veteran did not appeal the 10 percent rating assigned for his benign paroxysmal positional vertigo to the Board or request a higher-level review (HLR) of the rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601 or file a supplemental claim concerning the rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  

3. On July 29, 2021, the AOJ acknowledged receipt of a placeholder intent to file claim pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

4. On July 5, 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 in which he requested a disability rating higher than 10 percent for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

5. In October 2022, the AOJ increased the disability rating for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from 10 percent to 30 percent, effective July 29, 2021.

6. In June 2023, the Veteran filed a second supplemental claim, in which he requested an earlier effective date for his 30 percent rating; he argued that pursuant to VA policies concerning delayed filings associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, his July 2022 supplemental claim should be considered a timely response to the May 2020 decision; the AOJ responded to this claim by issuing a decision denying an earlier effective date for the 30 percent rating in June 2023.

7. The Veteran filed a request for a higher-level review (HLR) of the June 2023 decision; the AOJ decision addressing this request, issued in October 2023, concluded that the October 2022 decision made a clear and unmistakable error by assigning July 29, 2021, as the effective date for the 30 percent rating for benign paroxysmal vertigo and further concluded that the appropriate effective date for this benefit was July 21, 2022.

8. In its October 2023 decision the AOJ was correct in concluding that the effective date analysis in the October 2022 decision was based on a legal error, though the October 2023 decision does not correctly identify what that error was; however, the AOJ did not commit clear and unmistakable error because it is not absolutely clear that, if the AOJ had correctly applied the law, a different result would have ensued.

9. The Veteran has not shown good cause to extend the time limit for seeking review of the 10 percent disability rating assigned in the May 2020 AOJ decision.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The May 2020 decision granting a 10 percent disability rating for benign paroxysmal vertigo became final in May 2021, after the expiration of the period in which to file a request for a review option under 38 C.F.R. § 2.500.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d); 3.2500.

2. The Veteran's July 2022 supplemental claim application was filed too late to establish continuous pursuit of a claim for an increase in the initial 10 percent disability rating assigned by the AOJ in May 2020.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109, 3.2500(c).   

3. The October 2022 decision did not commit clear and unmistakable error by assigning July 29, 2021, as the effective date of the 30 percent rating for benign paroxysmal vertigo.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105; 3.400(o)(2).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1974 to July 1979.  This case comes to the Board from an October 2023 decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) which changed the effective date of the 30 percent rating assigned to his service-connected benign positional vertigo (vertigo) from July 29, 2021 to July 21, 2022.  Because the AOJ issued the relevant decisions after February 19, 2019, the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) applies to this case.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2, 20.4.

In June 2023, the AOJ denied a request from the Veteran to assign an effective date earlier than July 29, 2021 for the 30 percent rating for vertigo.  In response, the Veteran requested a higher-level review (HLR) of the June 2023 decision pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601.  The October 2023 decision - which the Veteran has appealed to the Board - was the result of the requested HLR.

In his VA Form 10182 ("NOD" or "Notice of Disagreement"), the Veteran selected the option of direct review by the Board without the submission of additional evidence and without a hearing.  When an appellant selects this option, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal.  Because the October 2023 decision was the result of a higher-level review (HLR) of the June 2023 decision, the evidentiary record is limited to the information in the claims file at the time of the June 2023 decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601(f).

In his NOD, the Veteran indicated his desire to appeal the "denial of [an] earlier effective date [for his 30 percent vertigo rating] back to 2018, see argument on HLR filed 6/26/23."  The October 2023 HLR decision, unlike the June 2023 decision, was not a simple denial of his request to move forward the previously assigned effective date for his 30 percent rating.  Instead, the AOJ considered the June 29, 2021, effective date previously assigned to the 30 percent rating, concluded that selecting that date had been clearly and unmistakably erroneous, and assigned a less favorable effective date (July 21, 2022).  The NOD does not expressly appeal the unfavorable change in effective dates implemented by the AOJ in October 2023.  But a reversal of that change is within the scope of the relief the Veteran requested in his NOD.  In other words, to grant the benefit the Veteran seeks - "[an] earlier effective date back to 2018" - the Board must necessarily reverse the October 2023 AOJ decision changing the assigned effective date from June 29, 2021, to July 21, 2022.  

Thus, in its analysis today, the Board has considered two distinct but related questions: (1) Did the AOJ err in changing the effective date for the 30 percent vertigo rating from June 29, 2021, to July 21, 2022? and (2) Is the Veteran entitled to an effective date earlier than June 29, 2021, for his 30 percent vertigo rating?  For the reasons below, the Board has resolved the first question in the Veteran's favor, but not the second. 

Procedural Background

In May 2020, after arranging an examination, the AOJ granted service connection for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with an initial disability rating of 10 percent, effective February 23, 2018 - the date of receipt of a placeholder intent to file claim.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b) the date of receipt of the placeholder intent to file was an appropriate effective date because the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ application form seeking service connection for vertigo in May 2018, within one year of the receipt of the intent to file form.  

The AOJ notified the Veteran of its May 2020 decision by mailing a copy of its decision and an explanatory letter to the address the Veteran identified in his May 2018 application for benefits.  The AOJ mailed a copy of the same letter to the Veteran's attorney.  The letter announced the favorable ruling on the claim for service-connected compensation for vertigo and further explained the assignment of a 10 percent disability rating, effective February 23, 2018.  Together with the May 2020 letter, the AOJ provided a document labelled VA Form 20-0998 ("Your Rights to Seek Further Review of Our Decision").  This form explained the different options (supplemental claim, HLR request, appeal to the Board) for seeking further review of the May 2020 decision.  "For most VA benefits," the form advised the Veteran, "you must elect one of the review options discussed below within one year of the date on your decision notice letter to preserve your right to receive the maximum possible benefit."  

During the 12 months after the AOJ notified him of the May 2020 decision, the Veteran did not appeal the 10 percent rating assigned for his vertigo to the Board or request an HLR pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601 or file a supplemental claim pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  He did, however, file multiple documents with the AOJ and successfully pursued an initial claim for service-connected compensation for major depressive disorder within that year.  

In October 2020, the Veteran sent the AOJ his initial application for compensation for his psychiatric disorder and a written statement.  Both documents indicate the Veteran's mailing address had not changed since May 2020.  The third and fourth paragraphs of the statement suggests the Veteran was aware of the AOJ's May 2020 decision granting service connection for vertigo because he wrote that, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.310, the AOJ should grant benefits for a psychiatric disorder which was, according to the statement, a secondary result of these service-connected disabilities: "a) Tinnitus b) Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo c) Bilateral hearing loss..."

In the first and second paragraphs of his October 2020 statement, the Veteran discussed the COVID-19 pandemic.  Hs requested, "expedited processing of my claim due to financial hardships caused by the COVID-19 National Emergency."  He asked the AOJ to arrange for any mental health examinations associated with his psychiatric claim "be conducted through telehealth or audio examination because of the COVID-19 National Emergency."

Within the year after the May 2020 decision, the Veteran also submitted the report of a psychologist in private practice, apparently prepared in October 2020, which concludes that, in the author's opinion, the Veteran's major depressive disorder was "a continuation of, or related to, secondary to, or aggravated by . . . service connected Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. . ."  

In December 2020, the Veteran participated in a VA mental disorders examination.  The AOJ granted his psychiatric claim on December 7, 2020.  And on December 13, 2020, the Veteran provided VA with updated information about the status of his dependents.  He did not submit any other information to VA during the 12 months after being notified of the May 2020 decision.

On July 29, 2021, the AOJ acknowledged receipt of a second placeholder intent to file pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  On July 5, 2022, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim application (VA Form 20-0995).  On this form, he requested an increased disability rating for vertigo.  In support of the claim, he provided a statement indicating that his vertigo symptoms "have worsened in the past couple of years."  According to his statement, the vertigo symptoms included "constantly staggering and tripping over my feet along with dizziness and head spinning anytime I move my head quickly in any direction or look up or down."  "Dizziness and occasional staggering" are the criteria for a 30 percent rating for peripheral vestibular disorders under 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6204.

July 21, 2022 (the currently assigned effective date of the 30 percent rating for vertigo) was the date of an in-person examination scheduled by the AOJ.  The medical history section of the examiner's report indicates that vertigo symptoms "stayed the same but increased in frequency: nausea, headaches, dizziness [with] movement, gait instability.  No falls reported."  On section III ("Vestibular Conditions"), the examiner wrote that the Veteran experienced episodes of hearing impairment with vertigo more than once a week.  The duration of these episodes lasted between one and 24 hours.  The examiner did not mark the box next to the pre-printed text "Staggering" on the questionnaire.  But in October 2022 the AOJ issued a decision increasing the rating for vertigo under DC 6204 from 10 percent to 30 percent.  The AOJ assigned July 29, 2021, the date of receipt of the placeholder intent to file, as the effective date of the increase.   

In June 2023, the Veteran filed a second supplemental claim application (VA Form 20-0995).  On this form, he wrote that his previous July 2022 supplemental claim "should be considered timely in response to [the] May 6, 2020, rating decision under VA's COVID extension policy (attached).  As such, the Veteran should be given an earlier effective date for his increased rating for vertigo."

As the quotation indicates, the Veteran attached a document, VBA Policy Letter 20-02 to his June 2023 supplemental claim.  Dated August 27, 2020, the letter supersedes the initial version of the letter, dated April 6, 2020.  It begins by acknowledging that "in some cases, local travel restrictions or other COVID-19 mandated health precautions may impact the ability of claimants to timely file forms, and other documents, or to perform travel that may be required as part of the VA claims/appeals process."  The letter reviews VA's authority under 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) and 19.53 "to grant time limit extension requests, provided good cause is shown for the delay"; to postpone action on a claim if good cause is shown for a claimant's failure to appear for a predetermination hearing (38 C.F.R. § 3.105(i)(2)) or VA examination (38 C.F.R. § 3.655); and to grant exceptions to date of receipt rules when a disaster interferes with the channels through which VA ordinarily receives correspondence (38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r)).  

The letter authorizes the regional offices to grant time limit extension requests "under the good cause provisions, provided the time limit would have expired or the situation occurred on or after March 1, 2020."  To remedy the effects of potential interruptions in postal service, the letter indicates that, for correspondence with no postmark or date stamp, VA should consider letters received between March 1, 2020, and August 27, 2020, as having been received on February 29, 2020.  Correspondence received after August 27, 2020, but before the 60th day after the end of the national state of emergency, should be considered to have been received 10 calendar days prior to the date of the date stamp or watermark.  

As noted in the introduction, in June 2023 the AOJ denied an earlier effective date for the 30 percent vertigo rating.  This decision rejected the Veteran's argument concerning Policy Letter 20-02.  The AOJ acknowledged the provisions in the letter designed to remedy the effects of interrupted mail service but concluded that because the Veteran had made "electronic submissions of claims forms and other evidence... the post mark policy does not apply."  The AOJ reasoned that the Veteran was properly notified of the initial 10 percent rating but failed to submit an appeal or other review request within the year after his receipt of the May 5, 2020, notice letter.  Based on the receipt of the Veteran's subsequent intent to file pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b), the AOJ concluded that July 29, 2021, was the appropriate effective date for the 30 percent rating.  

In the subsequent October 2023 HLR decision, the AOJ decided that the October 2022 decision, "committed a clear and unmistakable error in assigning an effective date of July 29, 2021, for the 30 percent evaluation of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. . .:"  According to the AOJ, the "earliest date ascertainable that your condition had materially worsened is VA examination dated July 21, 2022."

Analysis

Having reviewed the record, the Board agrees with the conclusion of the higher-level adjudicator that the October 2022 decision contains a legal error.  But the higher-level adjudicator did not correctly identify that error.  Furthermore, the error in its effective date analysis was not a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) for the purposes of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

A determination that a prior determination involved CUE involves the following three-prong test: (1) either the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were not before the adjudicator (i.e., there must be more than a simple disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated) or the statutory or regulatory provisions extant at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the error must be undebatable and of the sort which, had it not been made, would have manifestly changed the outcome at the time it was made; and (3) a determination that there was clear and unmistakable error must be based on the record and law that existed at the time of the prior adjudication in question.  See Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 314 (1992).

In the October 2023 decision, the higher-level adjudicator correctly noted that, because the change in the assigned effective date did not result in a reduction in the combined disability rating/level of compensation the Veteran received during the period affected by the effective date change (July 29, 2021, to July 21, 2022), the AOJ was not required to comply with the pre-reduction notice provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).  As noted, the October 2022 decision assigned the initial effective date for the 30 percent vertigo rating while granting the July 2022 supplemental claim in which the Veteran sought an increased rating for his vertigo.  According to the higher-level adjudicator, the analysis in the October 2022 decision was incorrect because, "A supplemental claim is not a claim for increase."   

38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(2) defines a supplemental claim as "any complete claim for a VA benefit on an application form prescribed by the Secretary where an initial or supplemental claim for the same or similar benefit on the same or similar basis was previously decided."  A claimant "who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim... any time after the agency of original jurisdiction issues notice of a decision, regardless of whether the claim is pending (see § 3.160(c)) or has become finally adjudicated (see § 3.160(d))."  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Whether it is appropriate to use a supplemental claim to pursue a benefit does not, contrary to the higher-level adjudicator's statement, depend on whether the claimant seeks an award of compensation for a non-service-connected disability or a higher disability rating for a condition for which he already receives compensation.  A claimant could use a supplemental claim to seek either kind of benefit if a previous decision has addressed "the same or [a] similar benefit on the same or similar basis..."  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(2).  Because the Veteran disagreed with the 10 percent rating assigned by the AOJ in its finally adjudicated May 2020 decision, filing a supplemental claim application was an appropriate method for pursuing the claimed benefit.

Nevertheless, the AOJ clearly made an error in its analysis when selecting the date of receipt of the intent to file as the effective date of the 30 percent rating because, according to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155, "The provisions of this section are applicable to all claims governed by part 3, with the exception that paragraph (b) of this section, regarding intent to file a claim, does not apply to supplemental claims."  Paragraph (b) of the regulation is the provision which authorizes VA to "consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received."  

But an error, standing alone, is not sufficient to conclude that a decision committed a CUE.  "A clear and unmistakable error is a very specific and rare kind of error.  It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.  If it is not absolutely clear that a different result would have ensued, the error complained of cannot be clear and unmistakable."  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(i).  

In support of his supplemental claim, the Veteran submitted the July 2022 statement, in which he wrote that his vertigo "worsened in the last couple of years."  He wrote he was "constantly staggering and tripping over my feet along with the dizziness and head spinning..."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) authorize an effective date before the date of receipt of an increased rating claim if it is ascertainable that the severity of the claimed disability approximated the criteria for a 30 rating during the year before the AOJ received the claim.  If the relevant increase in severity occurred before or after this period, then the general rule applies, and the appropriate effective date is the date of receipt of the claim.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

It is significant that the effective date assigned by the October 2022 decision (July 29, 2021) is within the year before the AOJ received the Veteran's supplemental claim (July 5, 2021, to July 4, 2022).  The symptoms the Veteran described in his July 2022 statement necessarily relate to his experiences before he wrote the statement, and they indicate that his vertigo was associated with "staggering" - the symptom which supports the assignment of a 30 percent rating under DC 6204.  Since it is unclear when he first began to experience occasional staggering, the evidence is consistent with the theory that his vertigo symptoms first most closely approximated dizziness with occasional staggering on July 29, 2021.  Because the effective date assigned by the October 2022 decision could be appropriate pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), it "is not absolutely clear that a different result would have ensued" but for the AOJ's erroneous failure to discern that 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b) does not apply to supplemental claims.

For these reasons, the Board disagrees with the higher-level adjudicator's October 2023 finding of clear and unmistakable error in the October 2022 decision and will restore the previously assigned effective date of July 29, 2021, for the Veteran's service-connected vertigo under DC 6204.

But the Board disagrees with the Veteran's argument that the AOJ should have granted an extension of the deadline for seeking review of the May 2020 decision due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, for that reason, that the Board should assign February 23, 2018, as the effective date of his 30 percent vertigo rating.   

As noted, to support this argument, the Veteran relied on VBA Policy Letter 20-02.  There is no precedential Court decision interpreting this policy.  But in Harris v. McDonough, No. 23-7537, 2024 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 2994 (December 30, 2024), the parties agreed that the policy letter was not binding on the Board.  See Id. at *5.  The Court vacated the Board's decision in Harris, not because the Board is bound by the policy but because the Board decision did not address it.  "Whether a provision of a VA guidance document is binding on the Board does not control whether the Board must address it.  Rather, 'the Board is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the document as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases.'"  Id. at *10-11 (quoting Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018)).  

"In the consideration of appeals and in its decisions, the Board is bound by applicable statutes, regulations of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and precedent opinions of the General Counsel of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The Board is not bound by Department manuals, circulars, or similar administrative issues."  38 C.F.R. § 20.105.  Because it is not a statute, regulation, or precedent opinion of VA's General Counsel, the Board is not bound by Policy Letter 20-02.  

The Board is bound by 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b), which provides that, "Time limits within which claimants or beneficiaries are required to act to perfect a claim or challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended for good cause shown."  

But the Veteran has not shown good cause for failing to seek review of the 10 percent rating assigned in the May 2020 decision before that decision became final.  Indeed, the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that the COVID-19 pandemic prevented the Veteran from seeking review of the May 2020 decision within the year after he was notified of the decision.

The Veteran's demonstrated ability to pursue his psychiatric claim and to submit other documents to the AOJ during year after he was notified of the May 2020 decision supports this conclusion.  In his October 2020 statement, the Veteran mentioned the pandemic, but he did not suggest that the pandemic would prevent, or even delay, his ability to pursue claims for VA benefits.  Indeed, he wrote that, because of the pandemic, he wanted "expedited processing of my claim..."   The only accomodation he sought due to the pandemic was that any examination associated with the processing of his psychiatric claim should take place "through telehealth or audio examination."  It is also significant that, during the year after he was notified of the May 2020 decision, the Veteran was apparently able to contact a psychologist for the purpose of assisting him in pursuing his claim and to obtain a report from her in October 2020.  He was able to submit that report to the AOJ, also in October 2020.  Since he was able to do all this during the pandemic, it is difficult to understand how the pandemic might have prevented him from seeking review of the May 2020 decision by filing a supplemental claim, HLR request, or appeal to the Board during the year after he was notified of the 10 percent rating.  

On his June 2023 supplemental claim application, the Veteran wrote that his "Supplemental claim dated July 5, 2022, should be considered timely in response to May 6, 2020, rating decision under VA's COVID extension policy (attached)."  But he provided no facts or other information tending to support a finding that the delay in the filing of the July 2022 supplemental claim was a result of the pandemic.  

Consistent with this ruling, the Board concludes that the Veteran did not file his VA Form 20-0995 until after the expiration of the one-year time limit for establishing continuous pursuit of the 10 percent disability rating for vertigo assigned by the 

?

AOJ in May 2020.  Accordingly, the Board will deny an effective date earlier than July 29, 2021, for the 30 percent rating for vertigo.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
