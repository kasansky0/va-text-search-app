FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Left knee chondromalacia is related to in-service injuries. 

2. Right knee chondromalacia is related to in-service injuries.  

3. Chronic bronchitis is manifested by FVC 116 percent of predicted, FEV-1 101 percent of predicted, and FEV-1/FVC 87 percent of predicted.

4. A non-compensable rating is assignable for erectile dysfunction with or without penile deformity. 

5. The Veteran is in receipt of the maximum award under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k) for loss of use of a creative organ. He has not lost either testicle, had significant reduction in the size of his testicles, or had complete absence of spermatozoa; no higher special monthly compensation category can be awarded.

6. The Veteran's migraine headache disability is productive of several prostrating headaches per month.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2000 to December 2004. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January 2023 and February 2024 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 and February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of increased rating for lumbar strain, increased rating for left hip pyriformis syndrome extension and thigh impairment, and increased rating for right hip pyriformis syndrome extension and thigh impairment, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service connection 

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, air, or space service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, air, or space service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131. 

Service connection may also be granted on a secondary basis for disability that is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (holding that secondary service connection is warranted under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "resulting from" language where a service-connected disease or injury is a but-for cause of a present-day disability, i.e., worsening of functionality through an etiological cause or through an inability to treat).  The Federal Circuit has held that 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b) is inconsistent with 38 U.S.C. § 1110.  Id.

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  For specified chronic diseases, if chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); see also Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).  Patellofemoral syndrome is not a chronic condition under 3.309(a); therefore, the provisions for chronic and continuous symptoms do not apply to the claimed knee disabilities.  

In addition, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022) changed how VA processes claims for toxic exposed veterans, in relevant part, it created a new basis for presumptive service connection based on exposure to burn pits and other toxins, expanded locations associated with service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, and the requirements for medical examinations.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1117, 1119, 1120, 1168.

The PACT Act provides that where a veteran submits a service connection claim with evidence of a disability and evidence of participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) during active military service and such evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability, VA shall provide the veteran with a medical examination and secure a nexus opinion unless VA determines that there is no assertion that the claimed disorder is related to the TERA.  Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759; 38 U.S.C. § 1168.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Entitlement to service connection for left knee 

Entitlement to service connection for right knee 

The Veteran contends that right and left knee disabilities are related to service.  

Service treatment records show that the Veteran reported knee pain during his separation examination.  He marked "yes" to a history of knee trouble.  An explanation section on the exam report noted that the Veteran reported pain in his knees more regularly than before.  

Post-service treatment records reflect a current diagnosis of patellofemoral syndrome of both knees.  

A September 2023 VA memorandum concluded that the Veteran participated in TERA during service as an air systems technician.  

A January 2023 VA examination addressed a medical nexus.  The examiner diagnosed patellofemoral pain syndrome of both knees.  The examiner opined that the claimed condition is at least as likely as not caused by the indicated toxic risk exposure activities after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effects of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.  The examiner's rationale was that physical trauma from lifting heavy airfield equipment and PT runs caused patellofemoral pain syndrome, a condition in which the cartilage under the kneecap is damaged due to injury or overuse.

In January 2024, a VA examiner opined that there was no diagnosis of a knee disability.  The examiner did not address the Veteran's reported history of knee pain.  As the examiner did not discuss the Veteran's pain symptoms, the opinion lacks probative value.  

The Board finds that the evidence for and against the claims is at least evenly balanced.  The Veteran is competent to report knee pain, and he is credible.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  There is a current disability of patellofemoral pain syndrome of the right and left knees and a nexus opinion relating his knee disabilities to his service occupation and TERA.  As any reasonable doubt must be resolved in the Veteran's favor, service connection for left and right patellofemoral pain syndrome is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 U.S.C. § 3.102; Lynch, supra. 

Increased rating 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  However, where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial ratings assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).  Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Increased rating for chronic bronchitis with shortness of breath

The Veteran seeks a higher initial rating for chronic bronchitis with shortness of breath.  The October 2023 rating decision granted service connection for chronic bronchitis with shortness of breath and assigned a non-compensable (0 percent) rating from August 2023.  

Chronic bronchitis is rated according to DC 6600.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for FEV-1 of 56 to 70 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent or daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy or inhalational anti-inflammatory medication. A 60 percent rating is assigned for an FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least 3 times per year) course of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids.

A maximum 100 percent rating is assigned under Diagnostic Code 6602 for bronchial asthma with an FEV-1 of less than 40 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, or more than 1 attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure, or requires daily use of systemic (oral or parenteral) high dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6600.

An October 2023 VA examination reflects a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and shortness of breath.   

The examination noted that Veteran's respiratory condition does not require the use of oral or parenteral corticosteroid medications, inhaled medication, oral bronchodilators, antibiotics, or oxygen therapy.  Pulmonary function tests showed FVC 116 percent of predicted; FEV-1 101 percent of predicted, and FEV-1/FVC 87 percent of predicted.  The VA examiner noted that DLCO testing was not indicated.  

The Board notes that the plain language of the criteria for each level of disability under Diagnostic Code 6600 specifically contemplates the effects of medication. Consequently, the Board's evaluation of the Veteran's chronic bronchitis may include the ameliorative effects of medication.  See McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271-73 (2016).

The Veteran has not submitted any lay statement regarding his chronic bronchitis disability. 

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for chronic bronchitis.  The evidence does not reflect FEV-1 of 56 to 70 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent or daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy or inhalational anti-inflammatory medication.  Accordingly, the criteria for the next higher rating are not met.  As the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim, it must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Increased rating for erectile dysfunction and special monthly compensation

The Veteran seeks a higher rate of special monthly compensation and a higher initial rating for erectile dysfunction.  In the VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated that he takes medication for erectile dysfunction.  

The October 2023 rating decision on appeal granted special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a) and granted service connection for erectile dysfunction with a 0 percent rating.

Erectile dysfunction is rated under Diagnostic Code 7522.  Diagnostic Code 7522 indicates that erectile dysfunction with or without penile deformity, will be assigned a noncompensable rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115b.

Special monthly compensation is payable under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k) for each anatomical loss of or the loss of use of one or more creative organs as a result of a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a).  Loss of use of a creative organ will be shown by acquired absence of one or both testicles, significant reduction in the size of the testicles, or absence of spermatozoa. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a)(1).

After review of the record, the Board concludes that a higher rate of special monthly compensation is not warranted and that a higher rating for erectile dysfunction is not warranted.

The Board finds that the Veteran is already in receipt of the maximum amount of special monthly compensation for loss of use of one creative organ, and there is no evidence of any additional loss of a separate creative organ, such as loss of either testicle or other further disability which would allow for further compensation. An October 2023 VA examination showed a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction. As noted above, a 0 percent rating is assignable for erectile dysfunction with or without penile deformity.  There is no other diagnosis identified by the VA examiner that warrants a separate rating under any applicable rating code.  As a result, the evidence persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction and a higher rate of special monthly compensation.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.31, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7522.

Increased rating for migraine headaches 

DC 8100 provides that migraine headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability are rated at 50 percent.  Migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months are rated at 30 percent. Migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months are rated at 10 percent. Migraine headaches with less frequent attacks are rated at 0 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The rating criteria do not define "prostrating."  The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" means attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018).  In other words, the term "prostrating" takes on its plain meaning of "lacking in vitality or will: powerless to rise: laid low."  Id.  However, "prostration" can be defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 1531 (32nd ed. 2012).  The term "productive of severe economic inadaptability" means either producing or capable of producing.  Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445 (2004).

The October 2023 rating decision granted a 30 percent rating for migraine headaches.  The Veteran seeks a higher initial rating.  

The Veteran had a VA examination in October 2023.  The Veteran reported that migraine headaches began in 2020 after starting on medications for PTSD, anxiety, and depression.  The headaches were described as pounding and stabbing in the frontal area, with no photophobia or vomiting.  They are treated with Tylenol migraine and sinus. The Veteran reported prostrating attacks of migraine pain more than once per month.  The Veteran reported experiencing pain on both sides of the head.  The VA examiner noted that headaches do not affect the Veteran's ability to work. 

The evidence shows that the Veteran experiences headaches that are prostrating in nature more than once per month.  VA has not defined "very frequent" completely prostrating attacks.  The Court has found that "very frequent" in the 50 percent rating criteria must mean more frequent than the 30 percent criteria, or more than once per month.  See Johnson v Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 253 (2018).  Therefore, based on the frequency and severity of his headaches, a 50 percent rating is warranted.  This is the highest rating available for migraine headaches.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an increased rating higher than 20 percent for lumbosacral strain

A review of the record reveals the Veteran was prescribed medication for joint pain, with the January 2024 VA examiner indicating medication for treatment of his lumbar spine.

As DC 5237 does not contemplate the effects of pain medication in its rating criteria, the Board's reliance on the current medical evidence of record would improperly consider the effects of medication.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012) (holding that, when assigning a disability rating, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria).  In Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, the Court held that Jones applies to the review of ratings of musculoskeletal disabilities. 

Thus, the Board finds that determining the ameliorative effects of such medication is necessary to adequately assess the severity of the Veteran's lumbar spine.

Entitlement to an increased rating higher than 10 percent for left hip pyriformis syndrome, limitation of extension

Entitlement to an increased rating higher than 0 percent for left hip pyriformis syndrome, thigh impairment

A review of the record reveals the Veteran was prescribed medication for joint pain, with the October 2023 VA examiner indicating medication for treatment of his left hip.

As DC's 5251-5253 do not contemplate the effects of pain medication, criteria, the Board's reliance on the current medical evidence of record would improperly consider the effects of medication.  See Jones, supra.  In light of the Court's holding in Ingram, a medical opinion is necessary to address the ameliorating effects of medication.

Entitlement to an increased rating higher than 0 percent for right hip pyriformis syndrome, limitation of extension 

Entitlement to an increased rating higher than 0 percent for right hip pyriformis syndrome, thigh impairment

A review of the record reveals the Veteran was prescribed medication for joint pain, with the October 2023 VA examiner indicating medication for treatment of his right hip.

As DC's 5251-5253 do not contemplate the effects of pain medication, criteria, the Board's reliance on the current medical evidence of record would improperly consider the effects of medication.  See Jones, supra.  In light of the Court's holding in Ingram, a medical opinion is necessary to address the ameliorating effects of medication.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from the January 2024 lumbar spine examiner or another appropriate examiner.  The examiner must provide a medical opinion identifying whether any medications the Veteran used during the appeal period affected the severity of his lumbar spine disability.

If so, identify each medication and clearly explain how such medication affected the condition.

If any such medication is productive of ameliorative effects, clearly identify such effects and opine as to the severity of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability absent such medication.  To the extent possible, such severity should be expressed in terms of range of motion (ROM).

In addressing the ameliorative effects of medication(s), the examiner is instructed to specifically address whether, absent such medication, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability would have manifested with ankylosis or the functional equivalence thereof, to include during flare-ups or following repeated use over time.

A detailed rationale for the opinion would be of considerable assistance to the Board.  If an opinion cannot be provided, the examiner should explain why it is not possible to provide an opinion.  

2.  Obtain an addendum opinion from the October 2023 hip examiner or another appropriate examiner.  The examiner must provide a medical opinion identifying whether any medications the Veteran used during the appeal period affected the severity of his right and left hip disabilities.  

If so, identify each medication and clearly explain how such medication affected the condition.

If any such medication is productive of ameliorative effects, clearly identify such effects and opine as to the severity of the Veteran's left and right hip disabilities absent such medication.  To the extent possible, such severity should be expressed in terms of range of motion (ROM).

In addressing the ameliorative effects of medication(s), the examiner is instructed to specifically address whether, absent such medication, the Veteran's left or right hip disability would have manifested with ankylosis or the functional equivalence thereof, to include during flare-ups or following repeated use over time.

A detailed rationale for the opinion would be of considerable assistance to the Board.  If an opinion cannot be provided, the examiner should explain why it is not possible to provide an opinion.
