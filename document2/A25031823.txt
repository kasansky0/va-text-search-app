DOCKET NO. 240626-451127
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to an effective date prior to February 15, 2024 for the grant of a 70 percent rating for service-connected PTSD, depression, anxiety and insomnia is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 4, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant or his authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1982 to October 1986.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 AMA rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran filed a timely appeal to the Board and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the appeal is now properly before the Board. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  In the present case, the appellant, through his authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  

In Hembree v. Wilkie, the Court held that where a written "withdrawal includes the name of the appellant and the file number and unambiguously identifies the claims to be withdrawn, then the written withdrawal will be considered valid and the Board need not look to other evidence to find it so." Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2020). The March 4, 2025 statement from the Veteran's representative meets this criteria and is considered a valid withdrawal.
