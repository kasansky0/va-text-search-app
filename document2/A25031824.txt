FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, he served on active duty in close proximity to the perimeter of Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand during the Vietnam era, and as such service connection for Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, PN, ED, and prostate cancer is warranted on a presumptive basis.

2. In an unappealed August 2013 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for hand tremors; the August 2013 rating decision became final. 

3. Following the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, which added Parkinsonism to the list of presumptively associated diseases with exposure to herbicide agents, the AOJ initiative review of the Veteran's claim for tremors; the Veteran continuously pursed this claim until service connection for Parkinson's disease was granted in a March 2024 rating decision. 

4. In an August 2013 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claim for bilateral upper and lower extremity PN, diabetes mellitus, and ED. The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement as these denials in September 2013. A statement of the case (SOC) was issued in June 2016; however, the Veteran did not submit a substantive appeal, and the August 2013 rating decision became final.

5. In a May 2018 rating decision, the AOJ denied the claim for service connection for prostate cancer. The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement in January 2019, and a SOC was issued in February 2020. However, the Veteran did not submit a substantive appeal, and the May 2018 rating decision became final. 

6. On December 10, 2020, the Veteran submitted an intent to file, and a formal supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) for service connection for diabetes mellitus, PN, ED, and prostate cancer was received by VA in January 2021. 

7. The Veteran continuously pursued his claims for service connection for diabetes mellitus, diabetic PN, ED, and prostate cancer following the December 2020 intent to file until service connection was granted in a January 2024 rating decision. 

8. As of June 28, 2022, the Veteran has been in receipt of a 100 percent service-connected disability with additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent; the evidence does not indicate that he was permanently housebound by reason of his service-connected disabilities. 

9. As of December 10, 2020, the Veteran has met the criteria for DEA benefits. 

10. The Veteran's dysphagia due to Parkinson's disease has been manifested by no more than moderate impairment; he has not been prohibited from eating solid foods.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1968 to December 1988. 

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision (residuals of prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus, bilateral upper extremity disability, bilateral lower extremity disability), a February 2024 rating decision (entitlement to SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ, diabetes mellitus, and bilateral lower extremity disability), a March 2024 rating decision (CAD, erectile dysfunction, Parkinson's disease complications, bilateral upper extremity disability, bilateral lower extremity disability, entitlement to SMC HB, eligibility to DEA benefits, diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea), and an August 2024 rating decision (right upper extremity disability) by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

The Board notes that as these claims have followed separate procedural paths, further discussion of the pertinent procedural history is provided as needed in the decision.  

Regarding the appeal as to residuals of prostate cancer, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Regarding the appeal as to CAD, Parkinson's disease complications, left upper extremity disability, bilateral lower extremity disability, entitlement to SMC HB, entitlement to SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ, eligibility to DEA benefits, diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Regarding the appeal as to right upper extremity disability, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

As to the claims adjudicated herein, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Additionally, because the Board is remanding the claim for service connection for OSA, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Lastly, the Board notes that the Veteran has waived the remaining time to switch dockets under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) through his representative in a January 2025 correspondence. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Earlier Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection shall be the day following the date of discharge or release if application is received within one year from such date of discharge or release. Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). 

Earlier effective dates can be established in some cases where an award or increase of compensation is granted pursuant to a liberalizing law. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a). Under these provisions, the claimant must have met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue and have been continuously eligible from that date to the date of claim or administrative determination. In such cases, the effective date of the award or increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue.

A claimant may indicate a desire to file a claim by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). Upon receipt of the intent to file, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate form. Id. If VA receives a complete application form within a year, it will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file. Id. 

VA regulations provide that a claimant may continuously pursue a claim for effective date purposes by "timely and properly" filing certain decision review requests (including a request for HLR and a supplemental claim) after an AOJ decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). Moreover, the provision governing the effective date of continuously pursued claims only states that a review request must be "timely" filed after a prior decision to establish continuous pursuit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

The Board notes that the Veteran's awards of service connection for Parkinson's disease complications, diabetes mellitus and its complications, and residuals of prostate cancer are all in receipt of an effective of August 10, 2022, pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act). Significantly, the PACT Act establishes by law a presumption of in-service exposure to herbicide agents for those that served in Thailand during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on June 30, 1976, "without regard to where on the base the veteran was located or what military job specialty the veteran performed." PACT Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168, § 403(d)(2) (2022). However, as the Board finds that the evidence of record indicates in-service exposure to herbicide agents on a facts-found basis, the Board finds that an award of service connection is warranted based on interpretation of law, regulations, and relevant VA policy in effect prior to the PACT Act, thereby allowing an effective date prior to the date of enactment of the PACT Act (i.e., August 10, 2022). 

Notably, the Veteran has contended that his Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, and prostate cancer are due to in-service herbicide exposure at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand.

VA has acknowledged that there was use of herbicide agents on the fenced-in perimeters of military bases in Thailand. Thus, in-service herbicide agent exposure on a Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand can be conceded on a "facts-found basis" whenever there is sufficient evidence that a veteran's duties included frequent contact with the perimeter of these Royal Thai Air Force Bases. See Compensation and Pension Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1), VIII.i.1.A.4.b; Stover v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 394 (2022); Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257 (2018).

Diabetes mellitus, type II, prostate cancer, and Parkinson's disease will be presumed service-connected if a veteran was exposed to herbicide agents in service, even if there is no record of the disease during service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e). This presumption requires exposure to an herbicide agent and manifestation of the disease to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(ii).

The Veteran's military personnel records indicate that he served at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base during the Vietnam era. Additionally, the Board finds that the evidence of record, including the Veteran's credible statements, establishes that the Veteran's duties included regular work on the perimeter of Ubon. Giving the foregoing, the Board resolves all doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds the Veteran's duties placed him near the base perimeter and exposure to herbicides during his service is Thailand is acknowledged on a facts-found basis.

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for right side masked facies associated with Parkinson's disease. 

4. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for left side stooped posture associated with Parkinson's disease.

5. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for right side stooped posture associated with Parkinson's disease.

6. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for left side speech impairment associated with Parkinson's disease. 

7. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for right side speech impairment associated with Parkinson's disease. 

8. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for loss of sense of smell associated with Parkinson's disease. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date of January 1, 2021, for the award of service connection for Parkinson's Disease and its associated complications. 

By way of procedural background, an August 2013 rating decision denied service connection for hand tremors. VA received no appeal, and no new and material evidence was received within one year of this decision. Accordingly, this decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 20.1103.

In January 2021, VA sent the Veteran correspondence that a special review of the Veteran's claim was being conducted. Specifically, it indicated that on January 1, 2021, the William M. Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 was enacted. Part of this Act amended 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2) to add Parkinsonism to the list of diseases presumptively associated with exposure to herbicide agents. See William M. Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, Pub L. 116-283 § 9109 (January 1, 2021).

Thereafter, in April 2022, the AOJ denied the claim for service connection for hand tremors also construed as Parkinsonism. In April 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, as to the April 2022 rating decision. In a July 2023 rating decision, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. Thereafter, in March 2024, the AOJ granted service connection for Parkinson's disease and its various manifestations effective August 10, 2022, pursuant to the PACT Act. 

As previously discussed, the Board has determined on a facts-found basis that the Veteran had qualifying service in Thailand for the purposes of concession of exposure to herbicide agents. Thus, after review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued his claim for Parkinson's disease after VA initiatively reopen the claim for tremors following the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. As previously discussed, 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a) provides that, when an award of benefits is granted pursuant to a "liberalizing law," the effective date of the award can be up to one year prior to the date of receipt of the claim, but no earlier than the effective date of the liberalizing law. Here, the liberalizing law was the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, which was enacted on January 1, 2021. 

In this sum, the Veteran's original claim for tremors was reviewed on VA's initiative within one year of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, which took effect January 1, 2021; he continuously pursued the reopened claim by filing a higher-level review request within one year of the April 2022 rating decision; and he has met all the relevant eligibility criteria for service connection for Parkinson's disease as January 1, 2021. Consequently, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of January 1, 2021, but no earlier, is warranted for the establishment of service connection for Parkinson's disease and its various manifestations. 

9. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for diabetes mellitus. 

10. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for left upper extremity diabetic PN. 

11. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for right upper extremity diabetic PN. 

12. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for left lower extremity diabetic PN. 

13. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for right lower extremity diabetic PN. 

14. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for ED. 

15. Entitlement to earlier effective date for residuals of prostate cancer. 

16. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date of December 10, 2020, for the award of service connection for diabetes mellitus and its complications (ED and diabetic PN) as well as residuals of prostate cancer. 

By way of procedural background, an August 2013 rating decision denied the claim for bilateral upper and lower extremity PN, diabetes mellitus, and ED. The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement as these denials in September 2013, and a SOC was issued in June 2016. However, the Veteran did not perfect his appeal by filing a substantive appeal (VA Form 9) within 60 days of the SOC; thus, the August 2013 rating decision therefore became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

Additionally, in a May 2018 rating decision, the AOJ denied the claim for service connection for prostate cancer. The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement in January 2019, and a SOC was issued in February 2020. However, the Veteran did not perfect his appeal by filing a substantive appeal (VA Form 9) within 60 days of the SOC; thus, the May 2018 rating decision therefore became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

On December 10, 2020, VA received an intent to file. Within one-year of the December 2020 intent to file, the Veteran filed a formal claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus, ED, prostate cancer, and bilateral upper and lower extremity PN. See January 2021 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. In March 2021, the AOJ denied the claims for service connection for diabetes mellitus, ED, PN, and prostate cancer. 

In January 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim as to March 2021 denials of service connection for diabetes mellitus, PN, ED, and prostate cancer. In an August 2022 rating decision, the AOJ again denied the claims for service connection. 

In August 2023, within one-year of the notice of the August 2022 rating decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review requesting review of the August 2022 denials of service connection for diabetes mellitus, PN, ED, and prostate cancer. In a December 2023 rating decision, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claims to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

In a January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for residual of prostate cancer, bilateral upper and lower extremity diabetic PN, and diabetes mellitus effective August 10, 2022, pursuant to the PACT Act.  

As previously discussed, the Board has determined on a facts-found basis that the Veteran had qualifying service in Thailand for the purposes of concession of exposure to herbicide agents. Thus, after review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued his claims for diabetes mellitus, PN, ED, and residuals of prostate cancer since filing the December 10, 2020, intent to file. Specifically, Veteran continuously pursed this claim by filing a supplemental claim within one year of the notice of the March 2021 decision, and a HLR request within one year of the notice of the August 2022 rating decision. Thus, there having been continuous pursuit of these claim, the Board finds that the proper effective date for the grants of service connection for these conditions is December 10, 2020. 

To that end, as the grant of service connection for ED is a downstream issue from the primary claim for diabetes mellitus, the grant of that separate rating is part and parcel of the grant of service connection for diabetes mellitus as a related, but separately ratable manifestation, the Board finds that December 10, 2020, is also the proper effective date for the service connection grant of ED and, therefore, also for the grant of SMC based on the loss of use of a creative organ.

In sum, the Veteran's intent to file that preceded his formal supplemental claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus, prostate cancer, and bilateral lower and upper PN, was received December 10, 2020, and was continuously pursued from that date until service connection was granted. The Board therefore finds that an earlier effective of December 10, 2020, but no earlier, is warranted for the establishment of service connection for residuals of prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus, bilateral upper extremity PN, bilateral lower extremity PN, and ED as well as entitlement to SMC based on the loss of use of a creative organ.

17. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for SMC HB. 

SMC is payable at the housebound rate if a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent, and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities, is permanently housebound. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). 

The evidence of record reflects that effective August 10, 2022, entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate was granted on the basis of 100 percent rating for CAD, and additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more. 

Based on grants of earlier effective dates for the Veteran's award of service connection for Parkinson's disease complications, diabetes mellitus and its complications, and prostate cancer, the Board finds that that the Veteran has meet the statutory requirements effective June 28, 2022. Specifically, the Veteran has been in receipt of a 100 percent rating for his CAD effective June 28, 2022, and his other service-connected disabilities are independently rated at 60 percent or more from that date. 

The Board finds that prior to June 28, 2022, the Veteran has not met the statutory requirements for SMC at the housebound rate as he is not in receipt of a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent (as discussed in further detail herein). Moreover, the evidence does not show, nor has it been alleged, that the Veteran was substantially confined as a direct result of his service-connected disabilities to his dwelling and the immediate premises. 

In sum, based on the evidence, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of June 28, 2022, but no earlier, is warranted for the assignment of SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).  

18. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for DEA benefits. 

Regarding the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for DEA benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the Board finds that an earlier effective date is warranted. The Veteran was originally awarded eligibility to DEA benefits effective June 28, 2022, based upon the receipt of a total combined disability rating as of June 28, 2022. 

DEA benefits are payable to the child or surviving spouse of a veteran, who will have basic eligibility if the following conditions are met: (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran had a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a).

Considering the grants awarded herein, the Board finds that the Veteran has meet the criteria for a DEA benefits effective December 10, 2020, as his combined evaluation for compensation reached 100 percent on that date. Accordingly, an effective date of December 10, 2020, is warranted for DEA benefits. 

Increased Rating

A disability rating is determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. VA has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable through the assertions and issues raised in the record, and to explain the reasons and bases for its conclusions. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999). However, separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. This practice is known as "staged" ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). 

If a veteran has an unlisted disability, it will be rated under a disease or injury closely related by functions affected, symptomatology, and anatomical location. 38 C.F.R. § 4.20; see 38 C.F.R. § 4.27 (providing specific means of listing diagnostic code for unlisted disease or injury).  

Where the schedule does not provide a 0 percent rating under a specific diagnostic code, a 0 percent rating will be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Diagnostic Code 8004 provides for a minimum rating of 30 percent for paralysis agitans, also known as Parkinson's disease. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8004. The minimum rating is the only rating provided for under Diagnostic Code 8004. If, however, there are identifiable residuals that can be rated under a separate diagnostic code or codes and the combined disability rating resulting from these residuals exceeds 30 percent, the separate ratings will be assigned in place of the minimum rating assigned under Diagnostic Code 8004. VA must also analyze individual symptoms under the appropriate diagnostic code for that bodily system.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  

Potential residuals include, but are not limited to, loss of smell or taste, bladder or bowel dysfunction, disorders to the cranial nerves or nerves in the extremities, and cognitive impairment. In the present case, the Veteran has been assigned multiple separate ratings for his various manifestations of service-connected Parkinson's disease, which the Board will discuss in further detail herein.  

19. Entitlement to an increased rating for dysphagia. 

The Veteran is in receipt of an initial 30 percent rating for dysphagia due to Parkinson's disease, by analogy, pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7203. 

Diagnostic Code 7203, which evaluates stricture of the esophagus, most closely compensates the Veteran's symptoms related to swallowing and adequately compensates him for symptoms pertaining to chewing. Under Diagnostic Code 7203, a 30 percent rating is assigned for moderate stricture of the esophagus.   Severe symptoms, specifically described as permitting liquids only, is assigned a 50 percent rating. An 80 percent rating is granted when stricture of the esophagus permits passage of liquids only with marked impairment of general health. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7203.

Considering the evidence of record, the Board finds that a rating in excess in 30 percent for dysphagia is not warranted at any time during the period on appeal.  Notably, the September 2023 VA Parkinson's disease examination noted moderate difficulty chewing and swallowing. A November 2023 VA examiner noted no pharynx and/or larynx and/or swallowing conditions. Additionally, the competent medical evidence does not indicate, nor has the Veteran contended, that his symptoms has been so severe as to preclude eating solid foods. 

The Board has considered the applicability of other Diagnostic Codes but finds that evaluating the Veteran's disability under Diagnostic Code 8205 or 8209 would not be as favorable as his difficulty chewing and swallowing has been manifested by, at worse, moderate impairment, which equates to a 10 percent rating under these Diagnostic Codes. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Codes 8205, 8209.  

In sum, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 30 percent for dysphagia, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. 

20. Entitlement to an increased rating for left side masked facies. 

21. Entitlement to an increased rating for right side masked facies. 

The Veteran is in receipt of initial noncompensable ratings for his masked facies of the right and left side due to Parkinson's pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8207. 

Diagnostic Code 8207 evaluates seventh (facial) cranial nerve paralysis. Under Diagnostic Code 8207, a 10 percent rating is warranted for incomplete moderate paralysis. A 20 percent rating is warranted for incomplete severe paralysis. A 30 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8207. A corresponding note indicates that Diagnostic Code 8207 is dependent upon relative loss of innervation of facial muscles. Id. 

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" are not defined in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Thus, the Board turns to dictionary definitions for assistance. See Nielson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d 802, 805-06 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (noting that absent an express definition, it is presumed that VA regulations employ words using their ordinary dictionary meanings). "Mild" is generally defined as "not being or involving what is extreme" or "not severe." "Moderate," as an adjective, is defined as "not violent, severe, or intense" or "limited in scope or effect." "Severe" is generally defined as "of a great degree" or "serious." See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 787, 1140 (11th ed. 2003).

Considering the evidence of record, the Board finds that a compensable rating for bilateral masked facies is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 8207. Specifically, the Veteran's loss of automatic movement such as blinking or leading to fixed gaze has not been characterized as more than mild. See September 2023 VA examination. The Board notes that there is no objective evidence to the contrary. Additionally, the Veteran's 2021, 2022, and 2023 VA treatment records note that the Veteran's cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact. Thus, the evidence of record does not demonstrate that the Veteran's masked facies more closely approximated moderate incomplete paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve. 

In view of the foregoing, the Board concludes that his loss of automatic movements has been no more than mildly impaired as the competent evidence does not indicate that his masked facies have been moderate in severity at any point during the appeal period. Consequently, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against compensable ratings for masked facies of the left and right side, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claims are denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. 

22. Entitlement to an increased rating for left side stooped posture. 

23. Entitlement to an increased rating for right side stooped posture. 

The Veteran is in receipt of noncompensable ratings for stooped posture of the left and right side due to Parkinson's disease pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8211. 

Diagnostic Code 8211 evaluates eleventh (spinal accessory, external branch) cranial nerve paralysis. Under Diagnostic Code 8211, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis. A 20 percent rating is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis. A 30 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis. C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8211. A Note indicates that Diagnostic Code 8211 is dependent upon loss of motor function of sternomastoid and trapezius muscles. Id. 

As previously mentioned, the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities does not define words such as "mild," "moderate," and "severe." Accordingly, the Board has considered the dictionary definitions for these words as previously defined herein. 

Considering the evidence of record, the Board finds that a compensable rating for stooped posture is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 8211. Specifically, the September 2023 VA examination noted mild stooped posture. The Board notes that there is no objective evidence to the contrary. Additionally, the Veteran's 2021, 2022, and 2023 VA treatment records note that the Veteran's cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact. Thus, the evidence of record does not demonstrate that the Veteran's stooped posture more closely approximated moderate incomplete paralysis of the eleventh cranial nerve.

In view of the foregoing, the Board concludes that his right and left stooped posture has been no more than mildly impaired as the competent evidence does not indicate that his stooped posture has been moderate in severity at any point during the appeal period. Consequently, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against compensable ratings for his stooped posture of the right side and left side, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claims are denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

24. Entitlement to an increased rating for left side speech impairment.

25. Entitlement to an increased rating for right side speech impairment. 

The Veteran is in receipt of noncompensable ratings for speech impairment of the left and right side due to Parkinson's disease pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8210. 

Diagnostic Code 8210 evaluates tenth (pneumogastric, vagus) cranial nerve paralysis. Under Diagnostic Code 8210, a 10 percent rating is warranted for incomplete moderate paralysis. A 30 percent rating is warranted for incomplete severe paralysis. A 50 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8210. A corresponding note indicates that evaluation is dependent upon the extent of sensory and motor loss to organs of voice, respiration, pharynx, stomach, and heart. Id.

As previously mentioned, the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities does not define words such as "mild," "moderate," and "severe." Accordingly, the Board has considered the dictionary definitions for these words as previously defined herein. 

Considering the evidence of record, the Board finds that a compensable rating for speech impairment is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 8210. Specifically, the September 2023 VA examination noted mild speech changes (monotone, slurring words, soft or rapid speech). A November 2023 VA examiner noted no pharynx and/or larynx and/or swallowing conditions and indicated that the Veteran's speech was normal. Additionally, the Veteran's VA treatment records indicate that his speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone. See January 2021, March 2022, June 2023, and December 2023 VA treatment records. Thus, the evidence of record does not demonstrate that the Veteran's speech impairment more closely approximated moderate incomplete paralysis of the tenth cranial nerve.

In view of the foregoing, the Board concludes that his speech impairment of the right and left side has been no more than mildly impaired as the competent evidence does not indicate that his speech impairment has been moderate in severity at any point during the appeal period. Consequently, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against compensable ratings for his speech impairment of the right side and left side, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claims are denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

26. Entitlement to an increased rating for left upper extremity disability. 

27. Entitlement to an increased rating for right upper extremity disability.

28. Entitlement to an increased rating for left lower extremity disability of sciatic and femoral nerves. 

29. Entitlement to an increased rating for right lower extremity disability of the sciatic and femoral nerves. 

The Veteran is in receipt of an initial 30 percent rating for right upper extremity disability pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8004-8514 and an initial 20 percent rating for left upper extremity disability pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8514. The Board notes that the evidence reflects that the Veteran is right-handed; accordingly, his right upper extremity is his major (dominant) extremity. 

Additionally, the Veteran is in receipt of initial 20 percent ratings for his bilateral lower extremity disability of the sciatic nerve pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8520. 

Paralysis of the musculospiral nerve (radial nerve) is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8514. Neuritis and neuralgia of that group are evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 8614 and 8714.   Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling for both the major and minor extremity. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 30 percent disabling for the major extremity and 20 percent disabling for the minor extremity. Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 50 percent disabling for the major extremity and 40 percent disabling for the minor extremity. Complete paralysis is rated as 70 percent disabling for the major extremity and 60 percent disabling for the minor extremity. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8514.  

Paralysis of the lower radicular group is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8512. Neuritis and neuralgia of that group are evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 8612 and 8712. Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling for both the major and minor extremity. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling for the major extremity and 30 percent disabling for the minor extremity.  Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 50 percent disabling for the major extremity and 40 percent disabling for the minor extremity. 38 C.F.R § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8512. 

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. Neuritis and neuralgia of that group are evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 8620 and 8720. Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

Paralysis of the internal saphenous nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8527. Neuritis and neuralgia of that group are evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 8627 and 8727. Under these criteria, mild to moderate paralysis is rated as noncompensable. Severe to complete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8527.

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves." The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).

VA's Adjudication Manual (M21-1) does provide guidance in evaluating the severity of paralysis of the peripheral nerves. In pertinent part, the M21-1 identifies moderate incomplete paralysis as larger-area sensory deficits, combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. Meanwhile, moderately severe incomplete paralysis contemplates motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability is expected. Severe incomplete paralysis contemplates motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability as well as trophic changes in severe longstanding neuropathy cases. See M21-1, V.iii.12.A.2.c.

Although the Board is not bound by the M21-1, the Board finds that the M21-1 guidance on the criteria for rating disabilities of the peripheral nerves is relevant to the instant matter and provides some useful descriptions of the types of symptomatology that would warrant finding moderately server or severe incomplete paralysis. The Board is not rigidly applying the M21-1 criteria here, but instead finds that it is both useful (and beneficial to the Veteran) in describing terms that are otherwise undefined, both for informing the Veteran of the bases of the Board's determinations, but also providing clarity and consistency to VA determinations. Overton v. Shinseki, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018).

Turning to the evidence of record, a February 2022 VA PN conditions examination noted moderate intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness of the bilateral upper and lower extremities. Muscle strength testing revealed normal results. Sensory examination revealed normal results, except decreased sensation to light touch in the bilateral feet/toes. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy. Reflex examination revealed that deep tendon reflexes were hypoactive (1+) for the bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradiales, knees, and ankles. The examiner noted trophic changes attributable to PN, specifically hair loss on all extremities. As to the upper extremities, the examiner noted bilateral mild incomplete paralysis of the radial nerve, median nerve, ulnar nerve, musculocutaneous nerve, circumflex nerve, and lower radicular group. As to the lower extremities, the examiner noted bilateral mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, external popliteal nerve, musculocutaneous nerve, anterior tibial nerve, internal popliteal nerve, posterior tibial nerve, and internal saphenous nerve. The examiner noted regular use of a cane for stabilization of gait due to PN as well as inability to feel cold, hot, or sharp objects in the hands and feet. 

During a February 2022 VA DM examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran's peripheral pulses examination findings were within normal limits. The examiner further noted that motor and sensory examination was within normal limits, to include gait and balance. 

A September 2023 VA Parkinson's disease examination noted moderate bradykinesia or slowed motion; moderate upper extremity tremor, muscle rigidity, and stiffness; mild left upper extremity tremor, muscle rigidity, and stiffness; moderate bilateral lower extremity tremor; and mild bilateral lower extremity muscle rigidity and stiffness. Moderate balance impairment was also noted. 

During a November 2023 VA central nervous system and neuromuscular diseases examination, muscle strength testing revealed that the Veteran's bilateral elbow and wrist flexion and extension, bilateral knee extension, bilateral plantar flexion, and bilateral ankle dorsiflexion was less than normal strength (4/5), grip was no movement against resistance (3/5), and pinch was normal (5/5). Deep tendon reflexes were normal, and there was no evidence of muscle atrophy. The examiner noted moderate muscle weakness of the bilateral and lower upper extremities. The examiner also noted bilateral hand tremors, more in the right hand. 

A January 2024 VA PN examination noted moderate intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness of the bilateral upper and lower extremities. Muscle strength testing and deep tendon reflexes were normal. Sensory examination revealed decreased sensation to light touch in the bilateral hands/fingers and feet/toes. Position sense, vibration sensation, and cold sensation testing of the bilateral upper and lower extremities were normal. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy or trophic changes. The examiner noted moderate incomplete paralysis of the radial nerve, median nerve, and ulnar nerve. The Veteran reported difficulty grabbing/gripping, typing, using hand tools as well difficulty with prolonged walking/standing due to pain and numbness. 

Bilateral Upper Extremities

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran's bilateral upper extremity disability is currently rated pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8514 regarding impairment of the radial nerve. Specifically, the AOJ has awarded ratings that correspond with moderate incomplete paralysis of the radial nerve. However, the evidence of record indicates that the bilateral extremity disability not only affected the radial nerve but also the median nerve, ulnar nerve, musculocutaneous nerve, circumflex nerve, and lower radicular group. The Board notes that rating the Veteran's disability pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8512 for impairment of lower radicular group is more favorable to the Veteran, as it provides higher evaluations. Specifically, as previously discussed, moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling for the major extremity and 30 percent disabling for the minor extremity under Diagnostic Code 8512. For these reasons, the Board finds that rating the Veteran's bilateral upper extremity disability pursuant to the lower radicular group rating (Diagnostic Code 8512) is more appropriate as opposed to the current assignment under Diagnostic Code 8514.  

Considering the evidence of record, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's left upper extremity disability or a rating in excess of 40 percent for the Veteran's right extremity disability is not warranted, as there is no competent evidence to support a finding that the Veteran has had worse than moderate incomplete paralysis of the lower radicular group. 

The medical evidence of record does not reveal any evidence of complete paralysis or muscle atrophy. Regarding motor functions, the evidence reveals that the Veteran exhibited moderate bradykinesia/slowed motion, moderate right upper extremity muscle rigidity/stiffness/tremors, mild left upper extremity muscle rigidity/stiffness/tremors. Additionally, during the appeal period, the Veteran's muscle strength was not severely diminished and/or absent. Rather, he exhibited, at worse, less than normal strength (4/5) for elbow and wrist flexion and extension, and no movement against resistance (3/5) for grip. As to trophic changes, the February 2022 VA examination noted loss of hair on the extremities. Regarding sensory disturbance, the Veteran reported moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and numbness. During the appeal period, he exhibited, at worse, decreased sensation to light touch in the bilateral hands/fingers. Additionally, the January 2024 VA examination noted that position sense, vibration sensation, and cold sensation testing revealed normal results. Regarding reflexes, while the February 2022 VA examination noted that the Veteran's deep tendon reflexes were hypoactive, the subsequent November 2023 and January 2023 VA examinations noted that his deep tendon reflexes were normal. Lastly, regarding pain, the Veteran reported having moderate pain in the bilateral upper extremities.  

For these reasons, the Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral upper extremity disability has been primarily manifested by impairment to motor functions, sensory disturbance, pain, and incomplete paralysis. The Board also finds that the most probative evidence of record is against finding that the disability has been manifested by atrophy, significant muscle weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability, or complete paralysis. The Board thus finds that the level of impairment was most analogous to moderate incomplete paralysis of the lower radial group.

In sum, the Board finds that a 40 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's right upper extremity disability, and a 30 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's left upper extremity disability effective December 10, 2020. To the extent that the Veteran contends entitlement to a higher rating, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and any further increased rating is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

Bilateral Lower Extremities 

Considering the evidence of record, the Board finds that ratings in excess of 20 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity disability pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8520, as there is no competent evidence to support a finding that the Veteran has had worse than moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve. 

The medical evidence of record does not reveal any evidence of complete paralysis or muscle atrophy. Regarding motor functions, the evidence reveals complaints for difficulty walking/standing, moderate balance impairment, moderate bradykinesia/slowed motion, moderate bilateral lower extremity tremor, mild bilateral lower extremity muscle rigidity and stiffness, and moderate muscle weakness. Additionally, during the appeal, the Veteran's muscle strength was not severely diminished and/or absent. Rather, he exhibited, at worse, less than normal strength (4/5) for bilateral knee extension, bilateral plantar flexion, and bilateral ankle dorsiflexion. As to trophic changes, the February 2022 VA examination noted loss of hair on the extremities. Regarding sensory disturbance, the Veteran reported moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and numbness. During the appeal period, he exhibited, at worse, decreased sensation to light touch in the bilateral feet/toes. Additionally, the January 2024 VA examination noted that position sense, vibration sensation, and cold sensation testing revealed normal results. Regarding reflexes, while the February 2022 VA examination noted that the Veteran's deep tendon reflexes were hypoactive, the subsequent November 2023 and January 2023 VA examinations noted that his deep tendon reflexes were normal. Lastly, regarding pain, the Veteran consistently reported having pain in the bilateral lower extremities. The February 2022 and January 2024 VA examinations noted moderate intermittent pain. 

For these reasons, the Board finds that the Veteran's disability has been primarily manifested by impairment to motor functions, sensory disturbance, pain, and incomplete paralysis. The Board also finds that the most probative evidence of record is against finding that the disability has been manifested by atrophy, significant muscle weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes reflecting a high level of limitation or disability, or complete paralysis. The Board thus finds that the level of impairment was most analogous to moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.  

Moreover, the Board nots that the evidence indicates that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity disabilities not only affect the sciatic nerve but also the external popliteal nerve, musculocutaneous nerve, anterior tibial nerve, internal popliteal nerve, posterior tibial nerve, and internal saphenous nerve. While VA's rating schedule recognizes that a single disability may result from more than one distinct injury or disease, rating the same disability or its manifestation(s) under different diagnostic codes - a practice known as pyramiding - is prohibited.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. The critical element in permitting the assignment of several evaluations under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disorders is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disorder. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

The Board notes that the sciatic nerve, external popliteal nerve, musculocutaneous nerve, anterior tibial nerve, internal popliteal nerve, and posterior tibial nerve are all part of the sciatic nerve branch, and therefore the functions associated with these nerves are not separate and distinct. As such, awarding a separate rating for another nerve that is part of sciatic branch would constitute impermissible pyramiding. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; see also Esteban, 6 Vet. App. at 261.  

However, the Board notes that as the internal saphenous nerve is part of the femoral nerve branch, which functions separate and distinct from the sciatic nerve branch, separate noncompensable ratings, but no higher, are warranted pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8527. The Board does not find that a higher 10 percent rating is warranted at any time during the appeal as the Veteran has not exhibited serve incomplete paralysis or complete paralysis for the reasons already discussed herein. 

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for ratings in excess of 20 percent for bilateral lower extremity disability of the sciatic nerve pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8520. Additionally, the Board finds separate noncompensable ratings for bilateral lower extremity of the femoral nerve pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8527 is warranted, effective December 10, 2020. To the extent that the Veteran contends entitlement to a higher rating, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and claims are denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

30. Entitlement to an increased rating for loss of sense of smell. 

The Veteran is in receipt of an initial noncompensable rating for loss of sense of smell due to Parkinson's disease pursuant to Diagnostic Code 6275. 

Under Diagnostic Code 6275, a maximum 10 percent rating is warranted for complete loss of sense of smell. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6275.  

Considering the evidence of record, the Board finds that a compensable rating for partial loss of sense of smell is not warranted at any time during the period on appeal. Notably, the September 2023 VA Parkinson's disease examination noted that the Veteran had partial loss of sense of smell. The Veteran's medical treatment records do not show symptoms more severe than those noted in the September 2023 VA examination report and the Veteran has not alleged that he has had complete loss of senses of smell. Accordingly, as the record does not show complete loss of sense of smell, a compensable rating for loss of sense of smell due to Parkinson's disease is not warranted.  

In sum, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for partial loss of sense of smell, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. 

31. Entitlement to an increased rating for ED. 

The Veteran's ED has been assigned a noncompensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7522.

The effective date of service connection for the Veteran's ED is now December 10, 2020. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b and Diagnostic Code 7522 were amended effective November 14, 2021. If a law or regulation changes during a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by the amendment's effective date. Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

Under the version of Diagnostic Code 7522 in effect before November 14, 2021, a 20 percent rating is warranted for deformity of the penis with loss of erectile power. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7522 (2020). No other evaluation was provided for under this version of the diagnostic code. As such, two requirements must be met before a 20 percent evaluation can be assigned under the prior version of Diagnostic Code 7522: (1) the deformity must be evident; and (2) the deformity must be accompanied by loss of erectile power. ED is not compensable in the absence of penile deformity.

Under the version of Diagnostic Code 7522 in effect since November 14, 2021, ED is evaluated with a noncompensable evaluation without regard to whether penile deformity is present. A note to the amended Diagnostic Code 7522 states that for the purpose of VA disability evaluation, a disease or traumatic injury of the penis resulting in scarring or deformity shall be rated under Diagnostic Code 7522. The Board notes this is the version of Diagnostic Code 7522 under which the Veteran's noncompensable rating was assigned. The older version of Diagnostic Code 7522 is more favorable to the Veteran in that it allows a 20 percent evaluation. 

Considering the evidence of record, the Board finds that a compensable rating for ED is not warranted at any time during the period under review. Specifically, while record indicates that the Veteran does have erectile dysfunction, the medical evidence does not reveal a penile deformity or abnormality. Physical examinations at the February 2022 and January 2024 VA examinations noted normal findings for the Veteran's penis and did not indicate that he had any penile deformities. Additionally, the Veteran has not provided argument that he suffers from a penile deformity. As previously discussed, a 20 percent rating under the older version of Diagnostic Code 7522 requires deformity of the penis. The new version of Diagnostic Code 7522 provides only a 0 percent, noncompensable rating with or without deformity. Accordingly, a compensable rating for ED is not warranted.

In sum, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for ED, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. The Board notes that the Veteran's symptoms of ED are contemplated by the award of SMC for loss of use of a creative organ as the disability is manifested by loss of erectile power. 

32. Entitlement to an increased rating for CAD. 

On June 28, 2022, VA received an Intent to File. Thereafter, on June 16, 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim request seeking an increased rating for CAD. In a March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted a higher 100 percent for CAD effective June 28, 2022. The Veteran filed the instant appeal in January 2025. 

Throughout the entire appeal period before the Board, the Veteran's CAD has been in receipt of a 100 percent rating pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7005-7017. 

Effective November 14, 2021, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7017 and coronary artery disease (CAD) under Diagnostic Code 7005 are rated in accordance with the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart. A 10 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 7.1-10.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or continuous medication is required for control. A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 5.1-7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or where there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multigated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging). A 60 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.1-5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms. A 100 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms.

One MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2). When the level of METs at which breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in those symptoms may be used. Id.

For purposes of the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart, heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (3).

Here, the Veteran's CAD is in receipt of total disability rating (100 percent) for the entire appeal period before the Board as the Veteran exhibited a workload of 3 METs or less during the November 2023 VA examination. Accordingly, the Board finds that there is no basis upon which to award an increased schedular evaluation as he is already receiving the maximum award. Accordingly, his claim for an increased rating must be denied as a matter of law. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

33. Entitlement to an increased rating for diabetes mellitus. 

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his diabetes mellitus with glaucoma, cataract, and right nevus which is in receipt of an initial 20 percent rating pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7913. 

Diagnostic Code 7913 provides a structured scheme of specific, successive, cumulative criteria. Each higher rating includes the same criteria as the lower rating plus distinct new criteria. Middleton v. Shinseki, 727 F.3d 1172, 1178 (Fed. Cir. 2013). A 10 percent rating is warranted when diabetes is manageable by restricted diet only. A 20 percent rating is warranted when diabetes requires one or more daily injection of insulin and restricted diet, or an oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet. A 40 percent rating is warranted when it requires one or more daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities. Regulation of activities is defined as avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities. A 60 percent rating is warranted when diabetes requires one or more daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring one or two hospitalizations per year or twice a month visits to a diabetic care provider, plus complications that would not be compensable if separately evaluated. A 100 percent rating is warranted when diabetes requires more than one daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities, with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring at least three hospitalizations per year or weekly visits to a diabetic care provider, plus either progressive loss of weight and strength or complications that would be compensable if separately evaluated. 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913

Compensable complications of diabetes are evaluated separately unless they are part of the criteria used to support a 100-percent evaluation. Noncompensable complications of diabetes are considered part of the diabetic process. Id., Note 1.

Because Diagnostic Code 7913 contains successive criteria, the criteria for the lower rating must be met before a higher disability rating may be awarded. A higher rating cannot be granted based on a finding that the Veteran's disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating. However, reasonable doubt regarding the presence of a criterion may be resolved in the Veteran's favor. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018).

The question in this appeal is whether the Veteran's diabetes mellitus required one or more daily injections of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities.  Regulation of activities is defined as avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities. This criterion requires medical evidence. Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 364-65 (2007).

The Board finds that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus has not required one or more daily injections, restricted diet, and regulation of activities during the appeal period. See February 2022 and January 2023 VA examinations. Here, the Veteran's treatment for his diabetes mellitus has included oral hypoglycemic agents. The evidence of record does not indicate, nor has the Veteran alleged, that his treatment includes injections of insulin and/or regulation of activities as part of his medical management of his condition. Thus, the criteria for a higher rating have not been met. 

In sum, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

Moreover, as previously discussed, the Veteran's bilateral upper and lower extremity diabetic PN and ED is already in receipt of separate ratings. Additionally, the Board's notes that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus rating currently encompasses the Veteran's eye conditions that are complications of his diabetes, to include glaucoma, cataract, and right choroidal nevus. The Board has considered whether any of the Veteran's eye conditions are entitled to separate compensable ratings. 

The General Rating Formal for Diseases of the Eye instructs to evaluate based on either visual impairment due to a particular condition or on incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79 

Diagnostic Code 6013 instructs to evaluate open-angle glaucoma pursuant to the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye. Diagnostic Code 6013 allows a minimum 10 percent rating for glaucoma if continuous medication is required. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6013.

The Veteran underwent a November 2023 VA examination, in which the examiner noted that the Veteran's glaucoma, cataract, and choroidal nevus were not attributable to the Veteran's decrease in visual acuity or visual impairment. Additionally, the Veteran was not found to have any incapacitating episodes attributable to his eye conditions in the past 12-months. The VA examination report noted that the Veteran had open-angle glaucoma of both eyes which requires continuous medication for treatment. 

Based on these findings, the Board finds that a separate 10 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's glaucoma pursuant to Diagnostic Code 6013, effective December 10, 2020, as the Veteran's open-angle glaucoma has required continuous medication. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. 

34. Entitlement to an increased rating for prostate cancer. 

The Veteran is in receipt of an initial 40 percent rating prior to January 17, 2024, and a noncompensable rating thereafter pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7528. The Board notes that the decrease from 40 percent to a noncompensable rating was not a rating reduction requiring application of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e) or 3.344 as both evaluations were assigned in the same decision (i.e., the January 2024 rating decision) and there was no monetary reliance on any rating prior to the lowering of the rating.  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528, a 100 percent rating is warranted for malignant neoplasms of the genitourinary system. A Note to Diagnostic Code 7528, instructs that following the cessation of surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure, the rating of 100 percent shall continue with a mandatory VA examination at the expiration of six months. Any change in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). If there has been no local reoccurrence or metastasis, the condition is to be rated on residuals as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528. 

Here, the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2016, and he completed radiation therapy in May 2017 and androgen deprivation therapy in July 2019. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in February 2022, in which examiner indicated that the Veteran did not have any renal dysfunction due to his prostate cancer. The examiner further noted that the Veteran did not have urine leakage, voiding dysfunction that required the use of an appliance, or obstructed voiding. Regarding urinary frequency, the examiner noted a daytime voiding interval between 2 to 3 hours, and nighttime awakening to void 5 or more times. No history of chronic prostatitis, urethritis, epididymitis, orchitis, or urinary tract infections was noted. It was noted that the Veteran's prostate cancer was in remission. 

The Veteran's 2023 VA treatment records are devoid of complaints or reports of nocturia or urinary frequency, hesitancy, incontinence, or retention. 

A January 2024 VA examination noted that the Veteran's prostate cancer was in remission. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have any renal dysfunction or voiding dysfunction as well as no history of chronic prostatitis, urethritis, epididymitis, orchitis, or urinary tract infections. 

Considering the evidence of record, the Veteran's predominant area of dysfunction due to residuals of prostate cancer is voiding dysfunction. Voiding dysfunction is rated as either urine leakage, frequency, or obstructed voiding. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a. Here, the evidence does not indicate, nor does the Veteran allege, that he has had urine leakage that requires the use of an appliance or absorbent material or obstructed voiding. Rather, the evidence indicates that he has had urinary frequency during the appeal period. 

Regarding urinary frequency as a residual of the Veteran's bladder cancer, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for daytime voiding interval between two and three hours, or; awakening to void two times per night. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted for daytime voiding interval between one and two hours, or; awakening to void three to four times per night. A maximum 40 percent disability rating is warranted for daytime voiding interval less than one hour, or; awakening to void five or more times per night. 

Here, the Veteran is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for urinary frequency, prior to January 17, 2024. Thus, there is legal basis upon which to award a higher schedular rating for urinary frequency. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994). Additionally, as previously discussed, the Veteran's prostate cancer residuals have not been manifested by urine leakage during the appeal period, which would allow for a higher 60 percent rating and his cancer has remained in remission. In sum, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an initial rating in excess of 40 percent for prostate cancer prior to January 17, 2024, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

Moreover, considering the evidence of record, the Board finds that a compensable rating since January 17, 2024, is not warranted. Specifically, the Veteran's 2023 VA treatment records and January 2024 VA examination report indicate no findings or complaints of nocturia, urinary frequency, urine leakage, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, or poor renal dysfunction. Consequently, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for his prostate cancer since January 17, 2024, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

REASONS FOR REMAND

35. Entitlement to service connection for OSA. 

The Board finds that the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's OSA may be secondary to his service-connected Parkinson's disease. Specifically, the November 2023 VA examination noted that the Veteran's Parkinsonism conditions, signs, and symptoms included sleep disturbance, described as sleep apnea causing chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale. The Board notes that the Veteran is currently service-connected for Parkinson's disease and not Parkinsonism, and the Veteran's treatment records note a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Thus, based on this evidence, a VA medical opinion should have been obtained as to whether the Veteran's OSA is secondary to his Parkinson's disease. The AOJ's failure to obtain an etiological opinion based on these facts constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand is required for an examination and etiological opinion regarding the Veteran's OSA.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination with an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of his OSA. 

After reviewing the claims file, the examiner is asked to opine as to the following: 

a)	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's OSA was caused by his Parkinson's disease; and

b)	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's OSA has been aggravated by his Parkinson's disease?

A full and complete rationale for all opinions expressed must be provided.
