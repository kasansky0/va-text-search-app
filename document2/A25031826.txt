DOCKET NO. 240918-477783
DATE: April 7, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran, who is the appellant, had service from January 1988 to April 1988, from December 1990 to June 1991, and from February 2003 to May 2004.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the September 2024 rating decision on appeal. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) obtained a July 2024 medical opinion prior to the September 2024 rating decision on appeal. However, this medical opinion does not provide an adequate rationale regarding whether the Veteran's sleep apnea is aggravated by the service-connected PTSD. An opinion will be considered inadequate unless it addresses both the "caused by" and "aggravation" avenues for secondary service-connection. El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136 (2013). 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's sleep apnea is at least as likely as not aggravated by the service-connected PTSD.
