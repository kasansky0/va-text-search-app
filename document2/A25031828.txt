ORDER

Service connection for a headache disability, as secondary to PTSD and/or tinnitus, is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's headache disability is caused by his service-connected PTSD and/or tinnitus.  	

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for headaches, as secondary to PTSD and/or tinnitus, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from October 1982 to January 1983.  

This appeal is being adjudicated according to the appellate process set forth under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  See 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 169 (Jan. 18, 2019); 38 C.F.R. § 19.2.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Evidentiary Standards

In deciding claims, it is the Board's personality to evaluate the entire record on appeal.  VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  It follows, that when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th, 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

The law requires the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran.  Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-29 (2000).  The Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence within the period on appeal and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim. 

Any findings favorable to the Veteran made by the VA Regional Office in notification of a decision are binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 20.810(a).  "Findings" means "conclusions on questions of fact and application of law to facts made by an adjudicator concerning the issue under review."  Id.  

Service Connection 

VA provides compensation for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  This is referred to as a "service connection."  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

Generally, in order to show a service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is due to or the result of, or aggravated by, a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. §?3.310(a), (b).  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show: (1) a current disability exists, (2) the veteran has a service-connected disability; and (3) the current disability was either (a) caused by; or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. §?3.310(b).  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).  "Aggravation," in the context of secondary service connection, is demonstrated when there is "[a]ny increase in severity of a non-service-connected disease or injury that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progress of the non-service-connected disease."  38 C.F.R. §?3.310(b).  Recently, in Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023), the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held 38 U.S.C. §?1110 employs only "but-for" causation in direct and secondary service connection claims.  Therefore, a service-connected disability need only be a contributing cause, not the contributing cause, to establish secondary connection.   

Service connection for a headache disability, to include as secondary to PTSD, is granted. 

In its July 2024 rating decision, the Regional Office included in its favorable findings that the Veteran has a currently diagnosed headache disability.  Additionally, the Regional Office included in its favorable findings that the Veteran is service connected for PTSD and tinnitus.  Absent clear and unmistakable error, the Board is bound by findings favorable to the Veteran made by the Regional Office.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the first and second elements of service connection on a secondary basis are met.  The issue remaining before the Board is whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed disability was caused by or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD and/or service-connected tinnitus.  

On careful review, the Board finds that the positive and negative evidence regarding the etiological relationship between the Veteran's service-connected disabilities and his currently diagnosed headache disability is at least in approximate balance.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination regarding the nature and likely etiology of his headache disability in April 2024.  The VA examiner documented review of the Veteran's VA-folder without in-person examination.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's headache disability was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected conditions of PTSD and tinnitus.  The VA examiner reasoned that a review of medical literature showed an association of PTSD, tinnitus, and headaches, however it was silent for a causal relationship between these conditions.  The VA examiner did not provide opinion regarding aggravation.  

The Veteran submitted a private medical opinion in support of his claim for service connection for a headache disability in April 2024.  The private medical agent documented review of the Veteran's service treatment and post military records as well as lay statements made by the Veteran.  The private medical agent opined that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's headache disability is proximately due to or the result of his service-connected disabilities of PTSD and tinnitus.  The private medical agent cited to and discussed medical literature indicating an association between tinnitus and various headache disorders, and that individuals with tinnitus commonly experience chronic headaches.  Additionally, the private medical agent cited to and discussed medical literature indicating a likelihood of the development of chronic headaches in patients with PTSD due to PTSD symptoms like hypervigilance and increased stress levels.  

While VA treatment records show treatment for a headache disability, they are silent for additional opinion regarding etiology.

Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's currently diagnosed headache disability caused by his service-connected PTSD and/or tinnitus.  Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for service connection for a headache disability, to include as secondary to PTSD and/or tinnitus is granted.
