ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement does not identify an appealable issue.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1982 to February 1988.

The Veteran's July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement does not identify any rating decision or adjudicative action from which an appeal can be initiated, and in the space provided for identification of the issues the Veteran seeks to appeal, he writes "[l]ow income - income was displayed incorrectly has [since] been corrected, only income is SS 1093.00 month..." 

As there no appealable issues have been identified, nor any adjudicative action identified from which to initiate an appeal, the Board finds there is no justiciable controversy before it, and the matter will be dismissed.
