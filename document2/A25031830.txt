ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a tooth disability is denied.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for unspecified anxiety disorder is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for tinea capitis is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's left ear hearing loss is related to service.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had right ear hearing loss at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a tooth disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

4. Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder has been productive of occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication; the evidence is persuasively against a finding of occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for left ear hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for right ear hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for a tooth disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for unspecified anxiety disorder have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9413.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2014 to February 2024.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a March 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 3, 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims of left and right ear hearing loss, a tooth disability, and anxiety, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of tinea capitis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for bilateral hearing loss, which he contends began after deployment in 2019. See 11/29/23 VA Examination at 2.

To establish direct service connection, there must be competent evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease; and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).? 

Service connection for impaired hearing shall only be established when hearing status, as determined by audiometric testing, meets specified pure tone and speech recognition criteria. For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38?C.F.R. §?3.385.? 

The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. Lynch?v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

Here, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of hearing loss for VA compensation purposes in the left ear only. See 10/30/23 VA Examination at 2. As will be explained further below, the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of hearing loss in the right ear for VA compensation purposes. He contends that his hearing loss began shortly after deployment in 2019. See 11/29/23 VA Examination at 2. He also reported having tinnitus in service. Id. at 2. The AOJ also found that the Veteran had toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) in service, which is a favorable finding binding upon the Board. See 38?U.S.C. §?5104A; 38?C.F.R. §?3.104(c).

Regarding whether the Veteran's left ear hearing loss is related to service, the October 2023 VA opinion supports a positive nexus. See 10/30/23 VA Opinion at 4. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss is due to service because there was a significant threshold shift, indicating moderate hearing loss, from when he began service in October 2014 compared to his audiogram taken in February 2016. Based on the audiograms and the Veteran's medical history, the VA examiner opined that the left ear hearing loss was caused by service.

Accordingly, as all elements of service connection have been met, the claim for service connection for left ear hearing loss is granted. See Lynch, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 C.F.R. § 5107(b);?38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss.

The Veteran is also seeking service connection for his right ear hearing loss, which he contends began after deployment in 2019. See 11/29/23 VA Examination at 2.

Here, the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of hearing loss in the right ear for VA compensation purposes. 

In October 2023, the Veteran underwent a separation health assessment. See 11/29/23 VA Examination at 2. He underwent an audiological evaluation and the pure tone thresholds, in decibels, for his right ear were as follows:

? 	? 	? 	HERTZ 	? 	? 

? 	500 	1000 	2000 	3000 	4000 

RIGHT 	5	10	10	5	10

A speech audiometry test was not administered. The examiner also found the Veteran to have tinnitus.

Also in October 2023, the Veteran underwent an audiological evaluation with a VA examiner and the pure tone thresholds, in decibels, for his right ear were as follows:

? 	? 	? 	HERTZ 	? 	? 

? 	500 	1000 	2000 	3000 	4000 

RIGHT 	5	10	5	5	25 

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 94 percent in the right ear. See 10/30/23 VA Examination at 2. The VA examiner found the Veteran to have normal hearing in the right ear. Id. at 3.

Neither the Veteran's service treatment records nor the post-service clinical record reveal hearing loss in the right ear for VA compensation purposes. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of hearing loss in his right ear for VA compensation purposes and did not have one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26?Vet. App.?289, 294 (2013); see also McClain v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?319, 321 (2007).

Although noise exposure is conceded based on the Veteran's in-service activities, there is still no evidence showing that he has hearing loss in his right ear that meets the criteria for VA compensation purposes under 38 C.F.R. §?3.385. 

The Board also acknowledges the Veteran's lay statements concerning hearing loss and such being linked to service. While he is competent to report symptomatology, he is not competent to diagnose a medical disability, such as hearing loss, as such diagnosis requires medical testing and expertise. See Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 469 (1994). Thus, these statements are not probative regarding the presence of hearing loss in the Veteran' right ear for VA compensation purposes.

Accordingly, service connection for hearing loss in the right ear is denied. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. See Lynch, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b);?38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a tooth disability.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for a tooth disability, including teeth grinding, which he contends is due to service and/or his service-connected anxiety. See 10/13/23 VA Form 21-526EZ; see also 7/3/24 VA Form 10182.

At the outset, the Board notes that service connection for VA compensation purposes is only available for specified dental and oral conditions which are specifically delineated in 38 C.F.R. § 4.150. The dental and oral conditions which service connection may be granted for VA compensation purposes are delineated at 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Codes 9900 to 9916. These include chronic osteomyelitis, osteonecrosis, or osteoradionecrosis of the maxilla or mandible; loss of the mandible; nonunion of the mandible; malunion of the mandible; temporomandibular disorder; loss of the condyloid process; loss of the coronoid process; loss of the hard palate; loss of teeth due to loss of substance of the body of the maxilla or mandible; loss of the maxilla; malunion or nonunion of the maxilla; and neoplasm of the hard and soft palate. 38 C.F.R. § 4.150.  Periodontal disease and caries are not disabilities for VA compensation purposes.

In this case a VA examination has not been afforded with respect to the claim of service connection for a tooth disability. As will be explained in further detail below, no such examination or opinion is required because the evidence does not suggest that the Veteran has a disability, or symptoms thereof, that may be associated with his active service.?38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d);?see also McLendon?v. Nicholson,?20?Vet. App.?79, 81?(2006).

Under?McLendon, in disability compensation claims, VA must provide a VA medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.?20?Vet. App.?79, 81?(2006); 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d);?38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Thus, there are four elements to review to determine if a medical examination is necessary. Id.

Here, the service treatment records reflect the Veteran having his wisdom teeth removed in March 2023. See 3/2/23 STRs at 19. Service treatment records also reflect the Veteran missing some teeth and show potential periodontal disease. See 8/2/23 STRs at 46, 110.

Post-service treatment records do not show any complaints or potential diagnoses related to the Veteran's teeth.

Other than his VA Form 10182 stating that he grinds his teeth due to anxiety, the Veteran did not submit any other relevant lay statements regarding his claimed tooth disability. See 7/3/24 VA Form 10182. He also did not submit any relevant lay statements from other individuals in connection with the claim. Thus, there is no evidence to suggest a history of continuous relevant symptoms dating back to service such as to suggest a chronic disability and no evidence demonstrating an impairment in earning capacity. 

In sum, the competent evidence of record reflects neither a diagnosis of a tooth disability, nor one related to teeth grinding, nor a history of potentially relevant symptoms. Therefore, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding a current disability here.

Further, while the Veteran believes that he has a dental disability and that it is related to service, he has not provided any specific details in support of his assertions and, in any event, as a lay person he is not competent to render diagnoses or address questions of etiology, which are medically complex.?See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011).

The Board emphasizes that Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service connection for disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in disability. See?38 U.S.C. § 1110; see also?McClain,?21 Vet. App. at 321. Accordingly, where, as here, competent medical evidence indicates that the Veteran does not have the disability for which service connection is sought, there can be no valid claim for service connection for the disability. See Gilpin v. West,?155 F.3d 1353?(Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer,?3?Vet. App.?223, 225?(1992).

For the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes that the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim, and service connection for a tooth disability is denied. The benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable. See?38 U.S.C. § 5107(b);?38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

4. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for unspecified anxiety disorder.

The Veteran contends that his service-connected anxiety is more severe than that contemplated by the currently assigned 10 percent rating. See 7/3/24 VA Form 10182. 

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The percentage ratings represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.? 

If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; see also Lynch?v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).? 

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations. See generally?38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski,?1?Vet. App.?589 (1995).?? 

The Veteran filed his claim of service connection in October 2023. See 10/3/23 VA Form 21-526EZ. He is currently in receipt of an initial 10 percent rating, effective February 29, 2024, for his service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code?9413.

Diagnostic Code?9413?applies the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (General Rating Formula). Under the General Rating Formula, a 10 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication.

A 30 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events). 

A 50 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. 

A 70 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relationships, judgment, thinking or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near- continuous panic or depression affecting ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.????? 

The maximum 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of closes relatives, own occupation, or own name.

The Board notes that the symptoms listed in VA's general rating formula for mental disorders are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating. Mauerhan v. Principi,?16?Vet. App.?436, 442-43?(2002). Evaluation under § 4.130 is symptom-driven, meaning that symptomatology should be the fact-finder's primary focus when deciding entitlement to a given disability rating under that regulation. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki,?713 F.3d 112, 116-17?(Fed. Cir. 2013).

While the evaluation under § 4.130 is focused on symptomatology, the frequency, severity, and duration of the symptoms also play an important role in determining the rating. Id. VA must engage in a "holistic analysis" that assess the severity, frequency, and duration of the signs and symptoms of the veteran's service-connected mental disorder; quantifies the level of occupational and social impairment caused by those symptoms; and assigns an evaluation that most nearly approximates the level of occupational and social impairment. Bankhead v. Shulkin,?29?Vet. App.?10, 22?(2017). 

Turning to the evidence of record, service treatment records show the Veteran attending therapy for anxiety, depression, and PTSD and being on medication. See 2023 STRs at 119; 10/26/23 VA Examination at 4. He also reported feeling anxious and depressed and having excessive worrying and trouble sleeping. See 2023 STRs at 119. He also was treated for insomnia. See 10/22/23 JLV/MTF at 16.

In October 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination, in which he was diagnosed with unspecified anxiety disorder. See 10/26/23 VA Examination at 1. He reported that he was formerly married but was currently single. He did not have any children. His relationships in service and with his family were mostly positive; however, he was estranged from his father. He felt he had an adequate support system. He also reported being introverted/extraverted by nature and to have a full schedule of leisure and social activities that were not inhibited by mental health concerns. He did not have any emotional or behavioral problems at work and did not have any issues with or was reprimanded by supervisors. He also did not have any reduction in work-related productivity or any discord among peers. At the time of the examination, he reported to have an "even" or neutral mood most days but did have intermittent anxiety that was not impairing. He also reported nightmares of being on a boat or being chased but the dreams were not disturbing and did not cause functional impairment. Id. at 4-5. The Veteran's self-esteem, self-image, outlook on his future, appetite, energy level, motivation, attention/focus, memory, interests, pleasures, and sleep pattern were all within normal limits. There was also no evidence of mania, suicide, PTSD, or functional impairment.

The VA examiner found the Veteran to have anxiety. Id. at 9. He also found the Veteran to have a mental condition with symptoms that were not severe enough either to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication. Id. at 3.

When considering the frequency, severity, and duration of the Veteran's impairment in assessing his disability picture, the Board finds that, throughout the appeal period, the evidence demonstrates occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication. The evidence shows that the Veteran's anxiety manifested by excessive worrying, some depression, and sleep issues. Such symptomatology is consistent with his currently assigned 10 percent rating.?

However, the Veteran's service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder does not meet the criteria for the 30 percent rating. As noted, a 30 percent rating requires occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events).

With respect to occupational functioning, the Veteran does not exhibit occupational impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal). He did not report any issues in service or at work with colleagues or supervisors. He also did not report any issues or difficulty performing occupational tasks. Thus, it cannot be concluded that the Veteran has occupational impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks.

With respect to social functioning, the Veteran does not exhibit social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal). Although he is no longer married and has an estranged relationship with his father, he still reported having good relationships with family and felt that he had an overall good support system. He also reported being introverted, but still maintained a full schedule of leisure/social activities. Thus, it cannot be concluded that that the Veteran has social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks.

Furthermore, the Board has considered the Veteran's reported history of symptomatology related to his service-connected anxiety, including his lay statements. He is competent to report such symptoms and observations. See Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 470?(1994). However, his credible descriptions of his observable symptoms more closely describe the 10 percent criteria, rather than the 30 percent criteria.

Accordingly, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted. The benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable. See?38 U.S.C. § 5107(b);?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?49, 55-56?(1990).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinea capitis is remanded.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for tinea capitis, which he contends is due to service. See 10/3/23 VA Form 21-526EZ. Although the Board regrets the delay, upon review of the claims file, additional development is necessary. 

Under the?AMA,?remand?is permissible only for correction of?pre-decisional?duty to assist errors and correction of an AOJ error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. 

The law provides that VA shall make reasonable efforts to notify a claimant of the evidence necessary to substantiate a claim and requires VA to assist a claimant in obtaining that evidence. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159. Such assistance includes obtaining treatment records and providing the claimant a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion when such an examination or opinion is necessary to decide a claim. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159. The threshold for determining whether the evidence "indicates" that there "may" be a nexus between a current disability and an in-service event, injury, or disease is a low one. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?79, 83 (2006).

Here, there is evidence of tinea capitis in service. See 3/12/18 STRs at 5, 45. The Veteran was diagnosed with such in March 2018 and was provided medication for such. See 3/12/28 STRs at 45. There is no indication that it resolved, as the Veteran contends that he continues to have rashes on his forehead. See 7/3/24 VA Form 10182. However, there is no medical examination of opinion of record addressing whether the Veteran's tinea capitis is due to service, which is needed to adjudicate the claim. Therefore, the low threshold of McLendon have been met, and a remand is necessary to obtain a VA medical examination and opinion.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Arrange a VA examination by a clinician with sufficient expertise to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's tinea capitis. The entire claims file and all pertinent evidence of records should be reviewed by the examiner prior to examination. The examiner should also elicit from the Veteran a detailed medical history. All necessary tests and studies should be performed. The examiner should indicate whether the Veteran has tinea capitis. Please opine to the following: 

For any diagnosed skin disability, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood of approximately 50 percent or greater) that it had its onset in service or is otherwise causally related to the Veteran's service?

The examiner is also advised that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms and treatment and that his reports, including his reports as to the onset and nature of his symptoms, must be taken into account, along with the other evidence of record, in formulating the requested opinions.? 

The examiner should set forth all examination findings, along with the complete rationale for any conclusions reached.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
