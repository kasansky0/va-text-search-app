DOCKET NO. 240805-462085
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as secondary to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's GERD is related to OSA.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for GERD as secondary to OSA have been met. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from December 1990 to June 1996. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.  

In response to the Veteran's December 2022 request for Higher-Level Review (HLR), a February 2023 rating decision returned the claim to the AOJ to correct a duty to assist error. The February 2024 rating decision on appeal here continued the denial of service connection for GERD. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected Direct Review. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. §?20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Generally, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is caused or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires competent and credible evidence demonstrating: (1) a current disability; (2) a service-connected disability; and (3) the current disability was either (a) caused or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Service connection for GERD as secondary to OSA.

The Veteran seeks service connection for GERD. See May 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ; August 2022 VA Form 20-0995; December 2022 VA Form 20-0996; August 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran's representative asserted the Veteran's GERD developed secondary to service-connected OSA. See August 2024 Third Party Correspondence. 

The AOJ favorably found the Veteran has a current disability, as the evidence shows he is diagnosed with GERD, and the Veteran's OSA is a service-connected disability. See February 2024 Rating Decision; November 2022 Rating Decision; October 2021 Rating Decision. These findings are binding on the Board. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). 

The Veteran stated he began experiencing symptoms of GERD after he developed symptoms of OSA. See May 2021 VA Form 21-4138. The Veteran described heartburn, back pain, acid reflux, regurgitation, difficulty swallowing, and coughing multiple times per day, and he reported the symptoms worsen at night, interrupting his sleep and requiring him to sleep in a bed with a raised head. Id. As a result of lack of sleep, the Veteran experiences daytime fatigue, difficulty concentrating, trouble thinking, weight gain, frequent yawning, low sex drive, mood changes, and irritability. Id. Veterans are competent to provide evidence of that which they experience, including symptoms and medical history. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Lay people are competent to describe visible or otherwise observable symptoms of disability. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The Veteran is competent to observe that his GERD symptoms onset after his OSA symptoms. If lay evidence is competent, the Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007). The Veteran's competent statements are consistent with other evidence indicating a relationship exists between GERD and OSA, as GERD symptoms developed chronologically after OSA symptoms developed, and both diagnoses cause symptoms that occur or worsen at night, interrupting the Veteran's sleep. The Veteran's competent lay statements are therefore credible and constitute highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the claim. 

Service treatment records (STRs) do not reflect complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to GERD. See STRs received August 1996. 

VA treatment records indicate the Veteran reported a medical history of private medical treatment for GERD. See CAPRI received May 2023; CAPRI received February 2024. At a February 2023 visit to establish healthcare at VA, the Veteran reported he is diagnosed with GERD, he has been experiencing dysphagia, and a swallow study performed at a private medical facility showed the Veteran's dysphagia is due to osteophytes on the cervical spine causing an obstruction. See CAPRI received May 2023. A May 2023 speech pathology consultation and evaluation indicated the Veteran reported his GERD was managed by medication, but the Veteran would benefit from a consultation with a gastroenterologist. See CAPRI received February 2024. An August 2023 community care coordination note indicates the Veteran completed a gastroenterology consultation at a private treatment facility, but the records of the visit are not shown. Id. Thus, VA treatment records are consistent with the Veteran's lay statements indicating he has experienced symptoms of GERD and therefore constitute probative evidence weighing in favor of the Veteran's claim.   

A September 2021 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with GERD, indicating that the Veteran reported being diagnosed with GERD in 2006 by a gastroenterologist at a private medical facility. See October 2021 VA Examination. Since then, the Veteran undergoes endoscopies and colonoscopies every three years. Id. The examiner opined the Veteran's GERD is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected OSA. Id. The rationale indicated medical literature weighs against a relationship between GERD and OSA because the two conditions have entirely different pathophysiology. Id. However, the examiner did not cite to or explain the medical literature to which she referred. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (holding that a medical opinion "must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions"). The examiner indicated the Veteran's reports indicate his GERD predated his OSA diagnosis and treatment, but the examiner did not address whether the Veteran experienced symptoms of OSA prior to diagnosis and treatment of OSA. Id. The opinion also failed to consider whether the Veteran's GERD is aggravated by OSA. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136 (2013). The September 2021 examination and October 2021 opinions are not consistent with the other probative evidence of record. Consequently, the September 2021 VA examination and October 2021 VA opinion are afforded minimal probative value.  

VA treatment records and September 2021 VA examination indicate the Veteran utilizes private medical providers for his GERD. See October 2021 VA Examination; CAPRI received May 2023; CAPRI received February 2024. It is unclear if the AOJ attempted to obtain the Veteran's private treatment records, so the Board acknowledges there may be additional medical evidence supporting the Veteran's assertions that GERD developed secondary to, is related to, or is aggravated by OSA. However, as this decision grants the benefit sought on appeal, remand to obtain those records is not necessary. 

An August 2022 private medical opinion found the Veteran's GERD at least as likely as not secondary to, related to, or aggravated by the Veteran's OSA. See August 2022 Medical Treatment Record. The examiner emphasized that the Veteran's lay statements indicate GERD symptoms are related to OSA, and medical literature supports a relationship between the pathophysiology of GERD and the pathophysiology of OSA. Id. The examiner discussed and attached medical literature explaining symptoms of GERD occur when the lower esophagus weakens, symptoms of OSA occur when the pharyngeal airway collapses during sleep, and between 58% to 62% of people experiencing OSA also experience GERD. Id. The examiner reviewed and cited the Veteran's records and lay statements, as well as medical literature. See Nieves- Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304 (2008). In assessing the relationship between GERD and OSA, the opinion's rationale considered both causation and aggravation. See El-Amin, 26 Vet. App. at 138 (2013). Therefore, the August 2022 private opinion constitutes highly probative evidence weighing in favor of service connection for GERD as secondary to OSA. 

An August 2022 VA examination indicated the Veteran does not have symptoms attributable to an intestinal condition other than GERD, and the September 2021 VA examination and October 2021 VA medical opinion address the Veteran's GERD. See August 2022 VA Examination. Thus, the August 2022 VA examination does not weigh in favor of or against the Veteran's claim for service connection for GERD. 

An October 2023 VA examination diagnosed GERD but opined that the Veteran's GERD is less likely than not related to service. See October 2023 VA Examination. The October 2023 VA opinion is based on factual inaccuracies. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993). The rationale indicates there was insufficient evidence to establish a diagnosis or treatment for GERD while the Veteran was on active duty, and the September 2021 VA examination's diagnosis of GERD occurred 35 years after the Veteran separated from service. Id. The date of the Veteran's GERD diagnosis is unclear, but the Veteran reported being treated for GERD since 2006, which is 10 years after the Veteran separated from service. Id. Further, the Veteran's STRs reflect repeated incidents of indigestion, nausea, decreased appetite, or vomiting during service, and the Veteran described experiencing symptoms of GERD ever since service. See STRs received August 1996; May 2021 VA Form 21-4138. As such, the October 2023 VA opinion is based on factual inaccuracies. See Reonal, 5 Vet. App. at 461 (1993).

The October 2023 examiner opined the Veteran's GERD is less likely than not related to the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) during service because there is no scientific or medical evidence to establish a relationship between the Veteran's GERD and in-service TERA. See October 2024 VA Examination. The opinion explained that the scientific and medical evidence suggests the Veteran's GERD is more likely to be related to hiatus hernia, obesity, or certain foods and medications. Id. The opinion is not adequate, as the rationale fails to discuss the Veteran's in-service TERAs, and an adequate rationale must discuss the specifics of the Veteran's in-service TERAs to conduct a synergistic, combined effect analysis of the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a)(2)(B). 

The October 2023 VA medical opinions are also inconsistent with the other probative evidence of record. Accordingly, the October 2023 VA opinion regarding GERD and the Veteran's in-service TERAs does not weigh in favor of or against service connection for GERD. 

For the above reasons, the probative evidence weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran's GERD developed secondary to, or was aggravated by, the Veteran's service-connected OSA. Service connection for GERD, as secondary to OSA, is therefore warranted. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
