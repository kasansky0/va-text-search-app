ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 12, 2021, for service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 12, 2021, for the 10 percent evaluation assigned for bilateral tinnitus is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 12, 2021, for the 20 percent evaluation assigned for lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The date of the Veteran's claim for service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy is May 12, 2021. In the alternative, the Veteran's May 12, 2021, claim for an increased evaluation for cervical strain was not received within one year of any factually ascertainable increase in disability. 

2. The Veteran's May 12, 2021, claim for an increased evaluation of tinnitus was not received within one year of any factually ascertainable increase in disability. 

3. The Veteran's May 12, 2021, claim for an increased evaluation of lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness was not received within one year of any factually ascertainable increase in disability. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to May 12, 2021, for service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to May 12, 2021, for the 10 percent evaluation assigned for bilateral tinnitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to May 12, 2021, for the 20 percent evaluation assigned for lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the Army from August 2002 to December 2006.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2023 decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that the Veteran filed a January 2022 supplemental claim asserting clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a June 2007 AOJ decision that granted an initial noncompensable evaluation for tinnitus. In his appellate brief, the Veteran again raises a contention of CUE in that decision. However, the AOJ has not yet adjudicated the Veteran's claim for CUE in the June 2007 decision. Therefore, the Board cannot adjudicate that claim. The Veteran may resubmit the claim to the AOJ or notify the AOJ that the issue is still pending.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 12, 2021, for service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy. 

The Veteran is in receipt of a 20 percent evaluation for right upper extremity radiculopathy from May 12, 2021, the effective date of service connection. On appeal, he contends that the effective date of service connection and of the 20 percent evaluation should be May 12, 2020, one year prior to his submission of intent to file a claim. For the reasons that follow, an earlier effective date is unwarranted.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5100; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If a claim for disability compensation is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date of entitlement is the day following separation or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). Otherwise, it is the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. When a veteran, or his representative, indicates the veteran's intent to file a claim, and a complete application is received within one year of VA's receipt of the intent to file a claim, the date of claim is the date of receipt of the intent to file. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

In this case, the Veteran submitted an intent to file for service connection, which VA received on May 12, 2021. The Veteran subsequently submitted a complete claim on October 22, 2021, within one year of receipt of the intent to file, seeking service connection for numbness in his hands. In January 2023, the AOJ granted service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy, claimed as numbness in the hands. Thus, the Veteran's date of claim for service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy is May 12, 2021, the date of VA's receipt of the intent to file. There is no record of any prior communication in which the Veteran, formally or informally, indicated an intention to seek service connection. Thus, the date of claim can be no earlier than May 12, 2021, and the effective date of service connection can be no earlier than that date.

In the alternative, the Board has considered whether an earlier effective date might be warranted if the Veteran's claim for service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy is considered as part of his May 12, 2021, claim for an increased evaluation for cervical strain, as service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy was granted as secondary to cervical strain. VA rates objective neurologic abnormalities associated with spinal disabilities as part of rating those disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injures of the Spine, Note 1; see Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 16-17 (2021) (holding that claim for radiculopathy was part of claim seeking higher compensation for spinal disability). Thus, it is at least arguable that the Veteran's claim for service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy was not a separate claim for service connection but part and parcel of his claim for an increased evaluation of cervical strain.

However, even when considered as part of an increased rating claim, service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy is not warranted prior to May 12, 2021.

In claims for increases in disability compensation, the effective date is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred, if a claim or intent to file a claim is received within one year of that date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). Otherwise, the effective date of the increased evaluation is the date of claim. Id.

In this case, the Veteran's claim for an increased evaluation for cervical strain was filed alongside his claim for service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy on May 12, 2021. Thus, the effective date for that claim could be as early as May 12, 2020, if a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one year prior to the filing of the claim. Id. However, if the increase in disability occurred prior to that date, then the effective date is the date of claim. Id.; Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 983-84 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

No factually ascertainable increase in the Veteran's cervical strain occurred within the year prior to the Veteran's May 12, 2021, claim such as to warrant an earlier effective date for service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy. At the November 2022 VA examination, the Veteran stated that episodes of numbness in his hands had begun in 2007. Treatment records do not otherwise indicate a factually ascertainable worsening of the Veteran's cervical strain or radiculopathy within one year prior to May 12, 2021. At most, a notation of right shoulder pain in June 2021 notes that the pain began more than one year prior, and this record neither clearly relates to the Veteran's radiculopathy nor establishes a factually ascertainable date of worsening. No other record shows onset or increase of symptoms associated with radiculopathy in the one year prior to May 12, 2021. Indeed, in a brief submitted with his Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran does not assert that any factually ascertainable worsening occurred and instead suggests that his radiculopathy has been at a stable level of severity since roughly 2012, significantly more than one year prior to the Veteran's date of claim.

In the absence of any factually ascertainable worsening in the year prior to the May 12, 2021, claim, the effective date of the claim for increased evaluation is the date of claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston, 605 F.3d at 983-84.

Thus, whether considered as a claim for service connection or as part of an increased rating claim, the effective date of service connection for the Veteran's right upper extremity can be no earlier than May 12, 2021, the date of claim. The Veteran's appeal is thus denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 12, 2021, for the 10 percent evaluation assigned for bilateral tinnitus

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 12, 2021, for the 20 percent evaluation assigned for lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness

The Veteran is presently in receipt of a 10 percent evaluation for bilateral tinnitus and a 20 percent evaluation for lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness, with both evaluations effective May 12, 2021. On appeal, the Veteran asserts entitlement to an effective date of May 12, 2020, one year prior to his date of claim. 

For the reasons that follow, an earlier effective date is not warranted. 

As explained above, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5100; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. When a veteran, or his representative, indicates the veteran's intent to file a claim, and a complete application is received within one year of VA's receipt of the intent to file a claim, the date of claim is the date of receipt of the intent to file. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). In claims for increases in disability compensation, the effective date is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred, if a claim or intent to file a claim is received within one year of that date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). Otherwise, the effective date of the increased evaluation is the date of claim. Id. If an increase in disability occurred more than one year prior to the date of claim, then the effective date is the date of claim. Id.; Gaston, 605 F.3d at 983-84.

In this case, the Veteran submitted an intent to file, which VA received on May 12, 2021. The Veteran subsequently submitted a complete claim on July 15, 2021, for an increased evaluation for tinnitus and an October 22, 2021, complete claim for an increased evaluation for lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness. Both complete claims were within one year of receipt of the intent to file. The date of claim is thus May 12, 2021.

No factually ascertainable increase in the severity of either the Veteran's tinnitus or his lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness occurred within the one year prior to the Veteran's May 12, 2021, date of claim. At the November 2022 VA examination, the Veteran stated that his lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness had worsened from its 2005 onset until 2012 but had been stable ever since. As to tinnitus, at a December 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his tinnitus began in 2004, then improved, and then worsened, with no indication as to when this worsening occurred. Treatment notes also do not contain any record that could be construed as a factually ascertainable worsening of the Veteran's lumbosacral strain or tinnitus within the one year prior to his May 12, 2021, date of claim. And in a brief submitted alongside his Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran reiterates that his lumbosacral strain has been stable since 2012 and asserts that his tinnitus should have been rated at 10 percent since a June 2007 AOJ decision granted service connection with a noncompensable evaluation effective December 8, 2006. (As noted above, the Veteran's claim of CUE in the June 2007 decision is not before the Board at this time.) Neither argument supports a factually ascertainable worsening of the Veteran's disabilities within one year prior to his date of claim.

In the absence of any factually ascertainable worsening in the year prior to the May 12, 2021, claim, the effective date of the claim for increased evaluation is the date of claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston, 605 F.3d at 983-84. Thus, the Veteran's claims for effective dates prior to the date of claim are denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness is remanded.

The Veteran is in receipt of a 20 percent evaluation from May 12, 2021, for lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness. On appeal, the Veteran contends that a higher evaluation is warranted based on the severity of his flare-ups. The Veteran also specifically asserts that the VA medical examination was inadequate.

For the reasons that follow, a remand is required to correct a pre-decisional error in the duty to assist by obtaining an addendum medical opinion.

Specifically, review of the record reveals the Veteran takes medication for his lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness. Specifically, at the November 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported that ibuprofen was an alleviating factor during his lumbar flare-ups. As the applicable diagnostic codes and special musculoskeletal regulations do not reference medication, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects when assigning an evaluation. See Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025). Here, the medical evidence of record is inadequate to the extent it is unclear whether the ameliorative effects of this medication, if any, were discounted in determining the severity of the Veteran's lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012). As such, a remand is necessary to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the severity of the Veteran's lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness. An examination should only be scheduled if the clinician deems one is necessary to provide the requested opinions. 

(a.) The examiner should indicate whether any medications used by the Veteran are productive of ameliorative effects on the service-connected lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness. 

(b.) If so, the examiner must identify each medication and clearly explain what the Veteran's symptoms and ranges of motions would be without the medication in all relevant measurements, to include during flare-ups or with repeated use over time.

(c.) In so opining the examiner should consider the lay and medical evidence of record. 

A rationale for all opinions must be provided. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she must explain why an opinion cannot be provided (e.g., lack of sufficient information or evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.).

2. Re-adjudicate the claim for entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for lumbosacral strain with sacroiliac injury and weakness.
