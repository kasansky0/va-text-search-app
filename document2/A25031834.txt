ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right ankle arthritis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's right ankle arthritis is related to his military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish service connection for right ankle arthritis are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1971 to June 1995.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a September 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In this decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) determined that new and relevant evidence had been received and adjudicated the claim for service connection for a right ankle disorder on the merits. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Service connection for right ankle arthritis.

The Board finds that service connection for the Veteran's right ankle arthritis is established.  

Service connection generally will be awarded when a veteran has a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

To establish service connection on a direct basis, the evidence must show: (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a link between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service (the "nexus" element). Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

The determination as to whether these elements are met is based on an analysis of all evidence of record and an evaluation of its credibility and probative value. See Jones v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 219, 225 (2002). The Board is required to consider all pertinent medical and lay evidence when evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); see also Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 367-68 (2005) (holding that the Board must assess the credibility of and weight to be given to the evidence).

Competent lay evidence is any kind of evidence that does not require that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994).

Competent medical evidence is necessary where the determinative question is one that requires medical knowledge. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Competent medical evidence is provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions. See Cox v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 563, 569 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1). It may also include sound medical principles found in medical treatises and statements contained in authoritative writings such as medical and scientific articles and research reports or analyses. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1). 

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. However, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the evidence is not in approximate balance and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Here, in the September 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made the favorable finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with the disability of right knee arthritis. This finding is binding on the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the first element to establish service connection is satisfied.  

As to an in-service incurrence, the Veteran's service treatment records are negative for any complaints or findings pertaining to a right ankle injury.  However, the Board finds the Veteran did incur a right ankle injury and symptoms during service.  In a detailed personal statement, the Veteran asserts he injured his right ankle in service while playing racquetball in approximately 1971 or 1972. See Lay Statement, April 2023. He indicates that he initially delayed seeking medical treatment but was eventually assessed in sick call as having a bad sprain. He states that following this injury, he experienced symptoms including pain and frequent twisting or spraining of his right ankle, both in service and thereafter. 

The Board finds the Veteran is competent to report symptoms and observable events within the realm of his personal knowledge. See Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469-71, Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. The Board also finds the Veteran's statements as to in-service events to be plausible and credible, including because they are consistent with statements made by the Veteran for purposes of securing medical services after service in 2009. See White v. Illinois, 502 U.S. 346, 356 (1992) (noting that a statement made in the course of procuring medical services is exceptionally trustworthy because the declarant has a strong motive to tell the truth in order to receive a proper diagnosis or treatment). Specifically, in a November 2009 medical appointment, the Veteran reported having a significant injury to his right ankle while playing racquetball in 1971, which he was eventually told was a severe sprain, and experiencing symptoms ever since. See Private Treatment Records, Tallahassee Orthopedic Clinic, November 2009. 

The remaining question is whether there is a nexus between the in-service incurrence and a current disability. The Board finds that the evidence persuasively establishes a nexus between the Veteran's right ankle arthritis and his in-service injury and symptoms. 

In August 2023, the Veteran was afforded an Ankle Conditions DBQ and Medical Opinion DBQ. The August 2023 VA examiner opined that the claimed condition is less likely than not incurred in or caused by an in-service injury or event. For a rationale, the examiner noted in relevant part: "According to the information reviewed, right ankle dysfunction cannot be attributed to military service without speculation. Sciatica diagnosis would not cause the right ankle dysfunction, requiring a fusion without a history of documented trauma to the right ankle."

The claims file also contains several private medical opinions. In a February 2021 Private Medical Opinion, Dr. A.G. opined that the Veteran's ankle disability is most likely caused by, a result of, or aggravated by his 1971 in-service injury. As a rationale, Dr. A.G. noted the injury caused chronic instability eventually leading to severe ankle arthritis after years of activity on an ankle with torn ligaments (originally occurring in the 1971 incident). 

In a March 2023 Private Medical Opinion, Dr. R.D. opined that the Veteran's ankle disability is directly related to his in-service injuries, including the right ankle injury in approximately 1971-1972 plus recurrent ankle trauma over time. The opinion explicitly considered at least four complaints of relevant symptoms noted in the Veteran's service treatment records, as well as the Veteran's post-service treatment records. 

The Board notes the August 2023 Medical Opinion DBQ examiner failed to adequately address the nature and etiology of arthritis or how the condition manifested and developed with this Veteran. Rather, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's disability was less likely than not due to an in-service sciatica diagnosis. Although the VA examiner noted the Veteran's report of an in-service ankle sprain in approximately 1971, and his report of experiencing symptoms including pain and weakness thereafter, the examiner did not opine on a link between these in-service events and the current disability. The examiner also referenced a lack of documentation of trauma to the ankle. See Ankle Conditions DBQ, August 2023; Medical Opinion DBQ, August 2023.

The VA examiner seemed to rely upon an absence of documentation of in-service trauma to the right ankle. This rationale failed to thoroughly consider the Veteran's lay statements describing his in-service injury and symptoms. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 & n. 1 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (finding that an examiner's opinion relied not on objective medical evidence, but on the absence thereof, and failed to consider whether lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of a veteran's disability such that his claim could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence). Therefore, the Board finds the August 2023 Medical Opinion DBQ to be inadequate, and thus affords it no probative value.

In contrast, the February 2021 and March 2023 Private Medical Opinions considered the Veteran's description of injuring himself in service in approximately 1971 and experiencing symptoms from that point forward. Both opinions also addressed the nature and etiology of arthritis through chronic or recurrent use of an injured ankle. The March 2023 Private Medical Opinion also specifically accounted relevant treatment records from service and post-service, including records not noted by the August 2023 VA examiner. The Board finds the private opinions to be persuasive, particularly in comparison with the August 2023 Medical Opinion DBQ. See e.g., Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (stating, "The Board must be able to conclude that a medical expert has applied valid medical analysis to the significant facts of the particular case in order to reach the conclusion submitted in the medical opinion"); D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 107 (2008) (stating, "The Board is permitted to favor one medical opinion over another provided it gives an adequate statement of its reasons and bases for doing so").

Therefore, the Board finds that the probative evidence weighs in favor of finding that there is a link between the Veteran's current right ankle arthritis and his military service, and specifically, the claimed in-service ankle injury and recurrent symptoms thereafter. Thus, the third element to establish service connection is satisfied.  For these reasons, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for right ankle arthritis is granted.
