ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran failed to perfect an appeal under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) for the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea; the appeal was procedurally defective and improperly docketed.

2. On May 8, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement on which he indicated he was appealing the denial of service connection for sleep apnea in a May 2023 rating decision.

3. The May 2023 rating decision did not adjudicate service connection for sleep apnea.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.104(c), 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service in the Army from January 25, 2011, to December 5, 2011.  

After a review of the procedural history of this appeal, the Board finds dismissal is warranted.

The Veteran filed a claim seeking service connection for sleep apnea in February 2022.  A February 2022 rating decision denied service connection for sleep apnea and sent notice to the Veteran on February 28, 2022.  The February 2022 rating decision was issued under the Appeals Modernization Act, also known as the AMA.

VA regulations under the AMA require that a completed VA Form 10182 be received within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed the notice of the decision being appealed.  The date of the mailing of the letter of notification of the decision is to be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).  Here, VA notified the Veteran of the February denial of service connection for sleep apnea in a February 2022 letter and informed him of his review options.

For every case in which the AOJ provides, in connection with its decision, a form for the purpose of initiating an appeal, an NOD consists of a completed and timely submitted copy of that form.  VA will not accept as an NOD an expression of dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative determination by the AOJ and a desire to contest the result that is submitted in any other format, including on a different VA form.  38 C.F.R. § 19.21(a)(1).  The Board may dismiss any case over which it determines that an appeal is ineligible for review.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c).

In August 2022, the VA received from the Veteran a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, seeking service connection for sleep apnea in August 2022.  On August 24, 2022, VA sent the Veteran correspondence acknowledging his desire for the VA to review the sleep apnea claim that was previously denied but informed him that VA regulation requires he file his request on the proper form, which was either a VA Form 20-0996, VA Form 20-0995, or VA Form 10182, depending on the type of appeal being sought.  The letter explained the situations for using each of these three forms.

On March 13, 2023, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 21-526EZ seeking service connection for sleep apnea.  On April 11, 2023, VA sent the Veteran correspondence acknowledging his desire for the VA to review the sleep apnea claim that was previously denied but informed him that VA regulation requires he file his request on the proper form, which was either a VA Form 20-0996, VA Form 20-0995, or VA Form 10182, depending on the type of appeal being sought.  The letter explained the situations for using each of these three forms.

A May 2023 rating decision denied service connection for hypertension and iron deficiency anemia.  On May 8, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement and indicated the issue he was appealing was service connection for sleep apnea, and he indicated the date of the decision being appealed was May 2, 2023.  However, the May 2023 rating decision did not adjudicate the issue of service connection for sleep apnea.  As previously noted, a February 2022 rating decision denied service connection for sleep apnea.  A VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement was not received within one year from the February 28, 2022, notification letter sent to the Veteran.

When the Board, on its own initiative, raises a question as to a procedural defect, all parties to the proceeding and their representative(s), if any, will be given notice of the defect(s) and granted a period of 60 days following the date on which such notice is mailed to present written argument and additional evidence relevant to jurisdiction and to request a hearing to present oral argument on the jurisdictional question(s).  The date of mailing of the notice will be presumed to be the same as the date stamped on the letter of notification.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c).

In a letter dated January 28, 2025, the Board advised the Veteran that his VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) was defective as to the issue of service connection for sleep apnea because the Veteran had not submitted a proper appeal to the February 2022 denial of the claim for service connection for sleep apnea.  The Board pointed out that the VA Form 10182 submitted by the Veteran listed the May 2023 rating decision as the decision being appealed but that the May 2023 decision did not adjudicate service connection for sleep apnea.

The January 2025 letter also informed the Veteran that the Board had the authority to dismiss the appeal of the issue of service connection for sleep apnea because of the identified defect.  The letter then advised the Veteran that he should submit, in writing, additional evidence or argument regarding the matter and why the Board should nonetheless decide the case within 60 days from the date of its letter, or request, in writing, a Board Hearing to present oral argument on the matter, again within 60 days from the date of its letter.  See Board's January 28, 2025, letter to the Veteran.

More than 60 days has lapsed since the Board's January 28, 2025, notification to the Veteran regarding the procedural defect and there has been no response.

As the May 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement did not identify a rating decision that adjudicated the issue of sleep apnea and was not submitted within one year from the date that the AOJ mailed the notice of the February 2022 decision denying service connection for sleep apnea, the appeal was procedurally defective and improperly docketed.  Thus, the issue of service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 20.104(c), 20.202.
