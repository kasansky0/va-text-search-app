DOCKET NO. 240524-444248
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

An effective date of July 14, 2021, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran served on active duty from June 1992 to February 1995.

2. An August 2015 rating decision denied service connection for PTSD under the legacy system; the Veteran did not appeal that decision, nor did he submit new and material evidence within one year and the decision became final.

3. In September 2016, the Veteran filed an Intent to File a Claim but did not submit a formal claim within one year.

4. In March 2020, the Veteran filed a claim seeking service connection for psychiatric disorders due to personal trauma. In April 2020 correspondence, VA notified him that he needed to file the claim on a proper form.

5.  On July 14, 2021, the Veteran filed another claim seeking service connection for PTSD due to personal trauma; although it was again on the wrong form, VA confirmed development of the claim in September 2021.  

6.  The second communication from the Veteran indicating an Intent to File a Claim was September 16, 2021; however, a completed compensation application was not received within one year. 

7. The third communication from the Veteran indicating an Intent to File a Claim was February 10, 2022. A February 6, 2023, Supplemental Claim was filed within one year.  

8.  A June 2023 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD due to military sexual trauma (MST) with a 50 percent rating assigned effective February 10, 2022. 

9.  The July 14, 2021, formal claim remained pending and unadjudicated until the claim was granted in the June 2023 rating decision. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of July 14, 2021, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for PTSD due to MST have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103 A, 5107(b), 5110 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

This decision has been written under the guidelines of the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  In June 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for PTSD due to MST with an evaluation of 50 percent effective February 10, 2022. In February 2024, the Veteran appealed the effective date to the Board via a Form 10182 and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Turning to the relevant laws and regulations, unless specifically provided otherwise in the statute, the effective date of an award based on an original claim for compensation benefits shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

The effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be the day following separation from service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation, otherwise the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  Any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA may be considered an informal claim.  Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).

Procedurally, the Veteran filed a claim for, among other things, PTSD in January 2015. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claim in August 2015. The Veteran did not timely appeal and no new and material evidence was received within one year and that decision became final. Therefore, absent clear and unmistakable error, which has not been alleged, the claim filed in January 2015 cannot be the basis of an earlier effective date.

In September 2016, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File form but did not file a proper formal claim for compensation within one year. Therefore, the September 2016 claim cannot be the basis of an earlier effective date.

In March 2020, the Veteran submitted a claim seeking service connection claim for psychiatric disorders due to personal assault. In April 2020 correspondence, VA notified him that he needed to file the request to review a previously denied claim on the proper form. On July 14, 2021, he again filed the wrong form seeking service connection for PTSD due to personal assault.  Nonetheless, in September 2021, VA confirmed the pending claim.  

Another Intent to File form was submitted on September 16, 2021, but the Veteran did not file a formal claim within one year. On February 10, 2022, he submitted another Intent to File form. Thereafter, a Supplemental Claim was filed on February 6, 2023. In June 2023, the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD due to MST with a 50 percent rating assigned effective February 10, 2022, date of an Intent to File form.

Based on the above, the claim for service connection received by VA on July 14, 2021, remained pending until the claim was granted in June 2023. Of note, although the Veteran again filed a claim for benefits on the incorrect form in July 2021, VA acknowledged the claim in September 2021 correspondence. This would reasonably lead the Veteran to believe that he had a claim pending as of July 2021, which the AOJ granted in June 2023. Consequently, an effective date of July 14, 2021, is warranted for the grant of service connection based on VA's receipt and acknowledgement of the claim on that date.

To the extent the Veteran argues that the effective date for service connection for PTSD should have been January 16, 2015, the date he originally filed a claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability, as noted, the claim was denied in an August 2015 rating decision and was not timely appealed nor was new and material evidence received within one year.  As such, that decision became final and cannot be the basic of an earlier effective date.  

To the extent the Veteran argues the record contains evidence of a psychiatric disorder predating a service connection claim cannot, alone, serve as a basis to assign an earlier effective date. See Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382-383 (1999) (holding that "the effective date of an award of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA").  

As noted, an effective date is established as of the date of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Therefore, even if psychiatric symptoms were present prior to filing a claim, the date of the claim is the later of the two and would be the date on which an effective date is based.

As such, in view of the foregoing procedural history, the grant of service connection for PTSD was initiated by the pending, unadjudicated July 14, 2021, formal claim for PTSD due to personal trauma; therefore, an effective date of July 14, 2021, but no earlier, is warranted for the grant of service connection. To this extent the claim is granted.

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, for the Board's consideration.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
