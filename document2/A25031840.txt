ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a sinus disability is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a sinus disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a sinus disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.320, 3.655.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran was a member of the United States Marine Corps Reserve from June 2006 to May 2014, during which he had a period of active duty from June 2008 to July 2009.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied service connection for a sinus condition.  

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), on which he identified the February 2024 rating decision denying service connection for a sinus condition and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a sinus condition.

The Veteran contends that he has a sinus condition as a result of his exposure to burn pits while stationed in Djibouti.  See October 2023 VA Form 21-526 EZ.  On his October 2023 application, the Veteran was asked to submit or identify records of treatment for the claimed condition, but did not do so.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Additionally, as noted above, the Veteran served on active duty from June 2008 to July 2009.  The RO has determined that during this period, he served in Djibouti.  See VA Memorandum, December 3, 2022; see also Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record, dated October 13, 2023.  Thus, the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to fine particulate matter.  38 C.F.R. § 3.320.  Chronic sinusitis and chronic rhinitis are presumed to be related to such exposure.  Id; see also 38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120.   

The record on appeal, however, does not contain clinical evidence of a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis or rhinitis, nor has the Veteran reported having been diagnosed with either condition or any other sinus disability.  

His service treatment records are negative for complaints or findings of a sinus disability.  At his March 2009 separation examination, the Veteran completed a Report of Medical History on which he denied having, or ever having had, sinusitis, as well as hay fever and chronic or frequent colds.  

In connection with his claim of service connection for a sinus condition, the Veteran was scheduled for a VA medical examination but he failed to appear for the examination without explanation.  See December 22, 2023, Exam Request.

In the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the RO explained that the evidence of record did not contain evidence of a current disability and although an examination had been scheduled in connection with the claim, the Veteran had failed to report without good cause.  The Veteran has since provided no explanation.

When a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with an original compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).  In this case, the examination at issue was scheduled in connection with the Veteran's claim for service connection.  It was necessary because the record contained no evidence of a current disability.  The record contains no good cause for the Veteran's failure to appear for the examination.  He has provided no explanation for his failure to report, nor has he argued that he did not receive notice of the examination.  

The Board has considered the arguments of the Veteran's representative that the record does not contain "proper notification, location of examination, date of examination, etc."  See March 2025 Written Brief Presentation.  

There is, however, a presumption of regularity under which it is presumed that government officials have properly discharged their official duties, including with respect to providing notifications.  Sthele v. Principi, 19 Vet. App. 11, 16 (2004); see Mindenhall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 271, 274 (1994).  To rebut the presumption, an appellant must assert nonreceipt and submit clear evidence that VA did not follow its regular mailing practices or that its practices were not regular.  Clarke v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 130, 133 (2007); see also Davis v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 29, 37 (2003).  In this case, the Veteran has provided no clear evidence that VA did not follow its regular practices in notifying him of the examination or that its practices were not regular.  He has not asserted that he did not receive notification of the examination.  Moreover, even if the record does not contain a copy of the actual notification, it does contain an October 2013 Exam Scheduling Request which lists the Veteran's current address of record, as well as his current telephone number and email address.  See Butler v. Principi, 244 F.3d 1337, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  

Under these circumstances, the Board must consider the appeal based on the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655; Turk v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 565, 568 (2008).  

Unfortunately, the record currently before the Board therefore contains no lay or clinical evidence of a current disability.  There are no post-service treatment records reflecting a diagnosis of a sinus disability at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  The Veteran has neither submitted nor identified any such evidence.  Although the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for a sinus condition, he has not reported ever having been diagnosed with a sinus disability nor has he claimed that he has sinus symptoms of a similar severity, frequency, and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2018); Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8, 15 (2020).  

In summary, the Board finds that the available evidence shows that the Veteran does not currently have a sinus disability.  Thus, the claim of service connection for a sinus disability is denied.  As the evidence is not in approximate balance and is persuasively against the claim, the benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
