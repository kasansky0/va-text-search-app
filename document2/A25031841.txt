ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 13, 2022 for the grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran filed a petition to reopen the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss on July 13, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the assignment of an effective date prior to July 13, 2022 for establishing service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1971 to January 1981.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a November 2022 decision. In December 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior November 2022 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 decision.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 13, 2022 for the grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied. 

The Veteran has asserted that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for his grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran filed an initial claim for bilateral hearing loss on August 14, 2000. The claim was denied in a May 2001 rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal the May 2001 rating decision, and the decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

The Veteran then filed a petition to reopen the previously denied service connection claim for bilateral hearing loss that was received by VA on July 13, 2022. In November 2022, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss, effective July 13, 2022, the date VA received the claim.  

In general, the effective date for a grant of service connection is the day following the date of separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service, or a claim reopened after final disallowance. Otherwise, it is the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b).

The Board finds that an earlier effective date is not warranted for establishing service connection for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss. In fact, the Board concludes that an effective date prior to July 13, 2022, is legally precluded. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r) (effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on a reopened claim will be the "[d]ate of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later"). The Veteran's claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss was granted based upon his July 13, 2022 claim to reopen the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. In this case, the later date is the date the claim to reopen the issue for service connection for bilateral hearing loss was received, July 13, 2022. This is the earliest effective date possible based upon the facts in this case and the applicable law and regulations. See id.

The Board considered the Veteran's assertions that service connection for bilateral hearing loss should be effective prior to July 13, 2022. The Board acknowledges that there may be evidence of bilateral hearing loss prior to July 13, 2022. However, the Court has explicitly stated that the "mere presence" of a diagnosis of a specific disorder in a VA medical report "does not establish an intent on the part of a veteran "to seek service connection for that disorder." Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998); see MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F. 3d 1323; 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. Accordingly, the mere existence of medical records in a case cannot be construed as an informal claim. Id.; Ellington v. Nicholson, 22 Vet. App. 141, 145-46 (2007); aff'd, 541 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

To the extent that the Veteran contends that the 2000 claim included documentation for the grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss, the correct vehicle to challenge the prior decision in 2001 would be to seek revision of that earlier decision based on clear and unmistakable error. In this case, however, the AOJ correctly set the effective date for the claim seeking reopening as of the date that the claim was received.

The first evidence of a claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss, following the 2001 final denial, was on July 13, 2022. The Board finds that there was no formal claim, informal claim, or written intent to file a claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss prior to July 13, 2022 and after the 2001 denial of service connection.

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt rule is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54-56 (1990).
