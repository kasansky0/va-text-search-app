ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of a 10 percent evaluation for a right ankle condition prior to June 7, 2022, based on clear and unmistakable (CUE) error is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The correct facts, as known at the time, were before the adjudicator in January 2011 and the statutory and regulatory provisions at the time were correctly applied. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of a 10 percent evaluation for right ankle condition prior to June 7, 2022, based on clear and unmistakable (CUE) error have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5019A;38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Army from May 1997 to May 2001 and from June 2006 to May 2008. 

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 Regional Office (RO) rating decision.

In the VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claims on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

Earlier Effective Date

Effective dates for claims seeking an increased rating for an already service-connected disability that are based on an original claim, or a claim for increase will be the day of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. However, the effective date may also be the earliest date as of which it is "factually ascertainable" that an increase in disability had occurred if the claim is received within one year from the date of the increase, based on a review of the entire evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see also Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997); Swanson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 442 (1999).

In determining whether an effective date assigned for an increased rating is correct or proper under the law requires (1) a determination of the date of the receipt of the claim for the increased rating as well as (2) a review of all the evidence of record to determine when an increase in disability was "ascertainable." See Hazan, 10 Vet. App. at 521. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date for the grant of a 10 percent evaluation for a right ankle condition prior to June 7, 2022, based on clear and unmistakable (CUE) error

The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date of January 4, 2011, for the grant of a 10 percent evaluation is warranted based on CUE. 

Prior VA decisions that are final and binding are accepted as correct in the absence of CUE. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a). Where the evidence establishes CUE, the prior rating decision will be reversed or amended. Id. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the following three-pronged test applies to determine whether CUE is present in a prior determination: (1) either the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were not before the adjudicator or the statutory or regulatory provisions in effect at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the error must be undebatable and of the sort which, had it not been made, would have manifestly changed the outcome at the time it was made; and (3) a determination that there was CUE must be based on the record and law that existed at the time of the prior adjudication in question. Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russel v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310 (1992); see also Bustos v. West, 179 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (to prove the existence of CUE as set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a), the claimant must show that an outcome-determinative error occurred). 

The Court has explained that CUE is a very specific and rare kind of error. It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993). CUE" are errors that are undebatable, so that it can be said that reasonable minds could only conclude that the original decision was fatally flawed at the time it was made." Russel, 3 Vet. App. At 313. "[E]ven where the premise of error is accepted, if it is not absolutely clear that a different result would have ensued, the error complained of cannot be, ipso facto, clear and unmistakable." Fugo, 6 Vet. App. At 43-44. In other words, when there is evidence, both supporting and against a previous determination, it is impossible for the claimant to succeed in showing that the result would have been manifestly different. Simmons v. West, 14 Vet. App. 84, 88 (2000). 

Clear and unmistakable evidence means that the evidence "cannot be misinterpreted and misunderstood, i.e., it is undebatable." Quirin v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 390, 396 (2009). The clear and unmistakable evidence standard is an onerous one. Laposky v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 331, 334 (1993)

In this case, the Veteran was granted service connection for a right ankle condition in an October 2011 rating decision. The Veterans representative argued there was CUE in the October 2011 rating decision that denied a compensable rating on the basis that 38 C.F.R. 4.59 allows a Veteran experiencing joint pain to receive a rating equivalent to the minimum compensable rating. Further, the representative argued that there is no requirement of objective evidence of painful motion to support a claim for the minimum compensable rating. 

The Board disagrees. Although current regulations allow for consideration of subjective complaints of pain in the absence of painful motion, it was not until the court case of Petitti v. McDonald in October 2015, that allowed for subjective complaints of joint pain to be considered. Prior to this court ruling, objective evidence of pain was required in order to grant a higher evaluation. A review of the Veterans VA examination from September 8, 2011, revealed no evidence of limited motion and specifically reported joint function was not limited by pain. 

With respect to the earlier effective date for the increased rating for the Veterans right ankle condition, the Board considered whether an effective date prior to June 7, 2022, is warranted. However, the AOJ granted a 10 percent rating for the Veterans right ankle condition, effective June 7, 2022, which was the date of the Veterans intent to file.

The Board reiterates that 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 provides that the effective date of an increased rating is the date of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, or the date an increase in disability became factually ascertainable, if within one year prior to the claim. However, the evidence from within one year prior to the receipt of the Veterans intent to file does not show that an increase in disability became factually ascertainable prior to his intent to file on June 7, 2022. 

Therefore, the claim for an earlier effective date for an increased rating for a right ankle condition based on CUE is denied.
