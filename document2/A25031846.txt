ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), including as secondary to a service-connected disability, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

There is no competent evidence of record that shows the Veteran has been diagnosed with IBS.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for IBS, including as secondary to a service-connected disability, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 2001 to January 2005.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In January 2021, the RO denied entitlement to service connection for IBS.  In January 2022, the Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim for his claim to service connection for IBS.  The RO issues another rating decision in September 2022 denying the claim.  In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the September 2022 rating decision.  In December 2022, the RO issued the HLR decision, which identified a duty to assist error related to the claim.  Specifically, the RO noted a failure to get other records and develop for clarification of symptoms and possible toxic exposure. 

In November 2023, the RO issued another rating decision denying service connection for IBS.  The RO also noting in the decision that a previous favorable finding, a clinical diagnosis, was overturned based on two subsequent examinations showing no support for a current diagnosis.    

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted another request for Higher-Level Review (HLR).  In March 2024, the RO issued the HLR decision on appeal, again denying service connection for IBS.  

In April 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the RO issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).  Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Service connection may also be granted on a secondary basis for a disability if it is due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) a current disability exists and (2) the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc).  An increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disease or injury shall not be service-connected if it is due to the natural progression of the nonservice-connected condition.  Id. at 447-48.  Service connection on a secondary basis may not be granted without medical evidence of a current disability and evidence of a nexus between the current disability and a service-connected disability.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512-14 (1998).

The Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal," and does not require that the evidence be in exact equipoise.  Under 38 U.S.C. § 5107 the benefit of the doubt rule is clear and unambiguous on its face.  Evidence is in approximate balance when the evidence in favor of and opposing the Veteran's claim is found to be almost exactly or nearly equal.  By reasonable doubt is meant one which exists because of an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence which does not satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Entitlement to service connection for IBS.

The Veteran asserts that he developed IBS secondary to his service-connected disability, Unspecified Trauma.  See October 2020 Claim VA Form 21-526EZ (Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits).  He stated that he began to get symptoms of IBS after having symptoms of Unspecified Trauma.  See October 2020 Statement in Support of Claim.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in November 2020 and the exam indicates a diagnosis of IBS in 2020.  

However, the examiner noted no corresponding treatment records to substantiate the diagnosis.  

The examiner referenced treatment notes from March 2003, July 2004, and October 22, 2020.  

The Veteran's service treatment records (STR) do not indicate he had ongoing symptoms related to IBS or that he was diagnosed with such while in service.  In fact, his post-deployment health assessment notes no diarrhea or frequent indigestion.  

As for the referenced October 22, 2020 medical record, there is no corresponding record of treatment on that date.  However, the Veteran's lay statement in support of his claim is dated October 22, 2020.  The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms he experiences, but the Veteran's lay statements must be weighed against the other evidence of record.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  To the extent the Veteran asserts that he has IBS associated with his service, including as secondary to a service-connected disability, the Board notes that the diagnosis of IBS requires clinical testing and medical expertise, and cannot simply be diagnosed by lay observation alone. 

Simply stated, the Veteran can not diagnose himself with a problem and then find it to be related to service. 

The Veteran underwent two additional VA examinations regarding his claim for service connection for IBS.  See February 2022 VA Examination and March 2023 VA Examination.  

Both examiners found no current diagnosis was warranted for the claimed IBS.  

In the February 2022 examination, the Veteran reported that onset of his IBS began in 2008/2009 with episodes of infrequent abdominal pain and diarrhea.  Since onset, he reported worsening with episodes of 3-4 liquid stools daily that occur 3-4 times per month.  Despite the Veteran's reported symptoms, the examiner was unable to confirm a diagnosis of IBS based on the examination and available medical records.  The examiner explained that the Veteran's symptoms are subjective, and the objective exam was normal.  

In the March 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported onset after service in 2010.  He stated he started suffering from heartburn and regurgitation but denied seeking medical attention for the symptoms.  He also reported worsening heartburn and regurgitation.  The examiner found that No diagnosis was warranted for the claimed IBS.  

The Veteran's subjective exam was consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) not irritable bowel syndrome.

Notably, the Veteran has been service-connected for GERD.  This problem is not at issue.  Problems the Veteran is having with his GERD can not form the basis of a finding that he has the problem at issue before the Board (to a degree, some of these problems may overlap). 

The Veteran's treatment records indicate he has been, at times, reported some gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.  See CAPRI records from October 2020, June 2022, and July 2022.  However, the Veteran's records do not indicate he has been diagnosed with IBS.    

The Board acknowledges the September 2021 private opinion from Ms. G. Uribe, APRN, but finds it has little probative value.  First, it does not appear that the examiner conducted a in person examination of the Veteran.  Rather, the examiner relied on the Veteran's subjective lay statement about his diagnosis and related symptoms.  

Second, the opinion relies on the conceded diagnosis from the November 2020 VA examination, which has now been overturned.  Finally, the opinion references several medical articles/studies on the relationship between IBS and mental health but fails to mention any of the Veteran's treatment or symptoms in the opinion.   

In comparison, the February 2022 and March 2023 VA examiners reviewed the claims file, treatment records, and examined the Veteran in-person.  Here the Veteran's assertions and the September 2021 private opinion are outweighed by the medical examinations of record, as well as the service and post service treatment records.  The Board finds that the objective medical evidence is more probative.

Simply stated, while some evidence in this case indicates the existence of the problem, the best evidence of record does not. 

As no diagnosed IBS is shown at any time during the period on appeal, the Board concludes that the most probative evidence is against the claim, and service connection is denied.
