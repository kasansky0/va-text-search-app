ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to service-connected disabilities, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The probative evidence of record shows symptoms of the Veteran's service-connected disability caused the Veteran to gain weight, which led to the development of sleep apnea.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to service-connected disabilities, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army on active duty from April 1979 to June 1980.

The issue comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be warranted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show: (1) that a current disability exists; and (2) that the current disability was either caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to service-connected disabilities

The Veteran contends that his diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea is related to his active-duty service, to include as secondary to his service-connected left leg disability.

The Veteran's April 2023 private sleep study provided the Veteran's diagnosis of severe obstructive sleep apnea.  The Veteran's September 2023 VA sleep apnea examination noted the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea with continued use of a CPAP machine.

The record contains the Veteran's June 2023 private medical opinion, which noted the Veteran's history of sleep apnea.  The Veteran's private medical professional reported the Veteran's diagnosis of left knee tendinitis, with known symptoms to include associated sleep disturbance related to pain.  The private examiner noted that due to the persistent pain of his service-connected left knee tendinitis, the Veteran was unable to be as active as he was before the onset of his musculoskeletal condition, which subsequently caused the Veteran to progressively gain weight.  The private examiner cited to medical literature and noted that weight gain has been established as secondary sequelae of a more sedentary lifestyle related to joint pain, knee stiffness, and muscle weakness.  Additionally, the private examiner reported the Veteran's sleep difficulties were caused by pain and noted medical literature showed increased risk of weight gain and obesity in adults with sleep disturbances.  Further, the private examiner noted medical literature showing obesity is known to predispose patients to obstructive sleep apnea.  The private clinician opined that evidence shows that the Veteran's service-connected condition has caused weight gain and obesity; and that obesity has caused or contributed to the Veteran's current obstructive sleep apnea.

The private physician concluded that it is at least as likely as not that (1) the Veteran's weight gain and obesity is due to and related to his service-connected left knee tendinitis; (2) the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is secondary to, related to, and aggravated by the weight gain and obesity from the service connected left knee tendinitis; and (3) without the Veteran's weight gain and obesity his obstructive sleep apnea would not have occurred.

Resolving the evidence in a light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds the June 2023 private medical opinion to be probative evidence that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is secondary to the Veteran's service-connected left knee disability.  The Board assigns probative value to the reviewing medical professional's opinions, as the examiner provided analysis of medical literature and applied the established medical principles to the Veteran's lay contentions, reported medical history, and the medical evidence of record.  See Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993); see also Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444 (2000).  Further, complete, and thorough rationales were given for the opinions provided which are consistent with the medical evidence of record.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295, 299-304 (2008); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) (noting in weighing credibility, VA may consider inconsistent statements and consistency with other evidence of record).

The Board recognizes the negative nexus opinion regarding the Veteran's sleep apnea condition provided in the September 2023 VA examination.  However, the Board finds that, given the Veteran's private medical opinion establishing the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was likely caused by the Veteran's service-connected condition, the evidence is at least in approximate balance on this matter.  

The Board must consider all the evidence of record and make appropriate competence, credibility, and weight determinations.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 367-68 (2005).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Thus, in the present case, the benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, as the probative medical evidence of record establishes sleep apnea is caused by the Veteran's service-connected knee disability, with obesity as an intermediate step linking the two conditions.  See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 306-07 (2020); see also Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (establishing "but-for" causation standard broader than proximate cause, which is not limited to a single cause and effect, but rather contemplates multi-causal links).

Thus, as the competent probative medical evidence of record demonstrates the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is secondary to the Veteran's service-connected left knee disability, the criteria for service connection have been met; and the Veteran's claim is granted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.
