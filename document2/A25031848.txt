ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 14, 2023 for the addition of the Veteran's spouse, P.S.M., to his award of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The record reflects that the Veteran and P.S.M. were married in June 2022.

2.  VA did not receive notification of the Veteran's marriage to P.S.M. until October 25, 2023, after an intent to file received on August 14, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to August 14, 2023. for the addition of the Veteran's P.S.M., to his award of VA disability compensation have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1115, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.4, 3.155, 3.204, 3.401.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2011 to June 2014.  The matter is on appeal under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) from a decision issued in November 2023.

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Veterans who have service-connected disabilities rated as 30 percent disabling and higher may be entitled to additional compensation for dependents.  38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4(b)(2).  When determining the effective date for an award of additional compensation for dependents, the effective date will be the last of the following dates: (1) the date of claim; (2) the date the dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within a year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the service member's award.  38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).

The "date of claim" for additional compensation for a dependent spouse is the date of the veteran's marriage, if evidence of the event is received within a year of the event; otherwise, the date notice is received of the dependent's existence, if evidence is received within a year of notification of such rating action.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.401.

Under 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101(a), a specific claim must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The Secretary has authority to prescribe the nature and extent of the proof required in order to establish a right to VA benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 501.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under laws administered by the Secretary.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(a).

Regardless of the regulation governing effective dates of awards, payment of monetary benefits begins the first day of the month following the effective date.  However, beneficiaries will be deemed to be in receipt of monetary benefits during the period between the effective date of the award and the date payment commences.  38 C.F.R. § 3.31.

Additionally, a claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  Id.  If within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a) appropriate to the benefit sought, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

In this case, the Veteran asserts that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for additional dependency benefits.  He seeks an effective date in June 2022, specifically the date of his marriage to P.S.M., for her addition as his dependent to his award of VA disability compensation.  As an initial matter, the record indicates that the Veteran has been in receipt of a disability rating of at least 30 percent since June 2014.  Therefore, the Veteran was nominally entitled to additional compensation for dependents prior to his marriage in 2022.

The record reflects that on August 14, 2023, VA received an intent to file a claim.  In October 2023, the Veteran submitted VA Form 21-686c, Declaration of Status of Dependents, indicating that he and P.S.M. were married in June 2022.

In October 2023, P.S.M. was added to the Veteran's award, with payment beginning on November 1, 2023.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 in October 2023, requesting Higher-Level Review.  The November 2023 decision found that entitlement to dependency benefits for P.S.M. effective November 1, 2023 was proper.  

In July 2024, the AOJ added P.S.M. to the Veteran's award effective August 14, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's intent to file.

The Board has reviewed all relevant evidence and finds no basis under the law to award an effective date earlier than August 14, 2023 for the addition of P.S.M. as the Veteran's dependent to his award of VA disability compensation.  VA first received the Veteran's intent to file on August 14, 2023, and within one year, in October 2023, was first notified of the Veteran's marriage to P.S.M. when the Veteran submitted the necessary information to VA to add P.S.M. as his dependent spouse to his award of VA disability compensation.  Based on this procedural history, the AOJ eventually assigned an effective date of August 14, 2023.  The Veteran had one year from his June 2022 marriage to P.S.M. to notify VA of such marriage, for the date of marriage to be considered the date of claim.  However, this is not demonstrated.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that he never received a letter in November 2014 and that he was not aware of dependency benefits being added to VA disability benefits.  He contends that since he has been married since June 2022 and receives disability benefits, he is entitled to be paid from the date of his marriage.  However, the November 2014 letter, which informed the Veteran of his grant of service connection for thoracic strain, adjustment disorder, cervical strain, traumatic brain injury, tinnitus, back scars, right foot disability, radiculopathy, right knee disability, and headaches notified the Veteran that he was being paid as a single veteran with no dependents.  In the same letter, he was also advised that his combined evaluation was 30 percent or more, and that he may be eligible for additional benefits based on dependency, including any retroactive benefits if he provided a dependency claim within a year of this letter.  He was advised that if he wished to notify VA of his dependents, he could do so through the eBenefits system. 

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that persons dealing with the Government are charged with knowledge of Federal statutes and lawfully promulgated agency regulations, regardless of actual knowledge or hardship resulting from innocent ignorance.  See Morris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 260, 265 (1991), citing Fed. Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 384-85 (1947).  Thus, even if the Veteran states that he may have been unaware of VA regulations and law, he was necessarily charged with knowledge of the regulation.  

For VA compensation purposes, notice means written notice sent to a claimant or payee at his or her latest address of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(q).  Under the presumption of regularity in the administrative process, it is presumed that a claimant received proper notice by VA.  See Boyd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 63, 71-72 (2014) (holding that under presumption of regularity, if notice is sent to the claimant's last known address of record, it will be presumed that VA properly discharged its official duties).  This presumption may be rebutted only with "clear evidence to the contrary."  Schoolman v. West, 12 Vet. App. 307, 310 (1999).  The mere assertion that the notice was not received does not by itself constitute clear evidence rebutting the presumption.  Id.  However, the presumption of regularity may be rebutted where there is evidence that (1) VA used an incorrect address on the mailing in question or (2) the mailing was returned as undeliverable and "there were other possible and plausible addresses available to VA" at the time.  Id. at 72.  

Here, the November 2014 notification letter was sent to the Veteran's last known address at the time, as well as to his representative.  The letter was not returned as undeliverable by the United States Postal Service.  Notably, all correspondence sent to the Veteran at the address listed on the November 2014 notification letter was also not returned as undeliverable.  The Veteran has not alleged that VA used an incorrect address on the mailing in question or the mailing was returned as undeliverable, and is aware that he receives disability benefits, which the November 2014 notification letter notified him of.  The presumption of regularity in the administrative process has not been rebutted, and the Veteran received proper notice of his eligibility to receive dependency benefits in November 2014.  

In any respect, there is no legal basis for awarding dependency benefits prior to August 14, 2023.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.401.  The Board is bound by the governing legal authority and is without authority to disregard the applicable law.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104.  For the reasons discussed, the Board concludes that an effective date earlier than August 14, 2023 for the addition of P.S.M. as the Veteran's dependent spouse to his award of VA disability compensation is not warranted.  Therefore, the appeal is denied.
