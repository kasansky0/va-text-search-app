REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a gastrointestinal disability (claimed as residuals of small bowel obstruction surgery) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1979 to September 1979.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 supplemental claim rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

By way of background, the Veteran filed for entitlement to service connection for a small bowel obstruction in a December 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The RO denied his claim in a December 2019 rating decision.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in May 2023 and expressed disagreement with the December 2019 rating decision.  

The Board mailed the Veteran correspondence in May 2023 that explained that his appeal was not docketed because his Notice of Disagreement was untimely.  See May 25, 2023, BVA Untimely Appeal Letter.  

A few days later the Board erroneously mailed the Veteran correspondence explaining that his appeal was not from a rating decision in the modernized review system but was rather in the Legacy appeal system.  See May 30, 2023, AMA Notification Letter.  The letter advised the Veteran to file a VA Form 21-0958, Notice of Disagreement.  See id.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-0958, Notice of Disagreement in June 2023, and VA mailed the Veteran correspondence in June 2023 advising the Veteran to file the proper form.  See June 2023 Request for Application AMA Review Letter.

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for a small bowel obstruction most recently addressed in a December 2019 rating decision.  The Veteran contended he submitted his appeal late because of COVID.  See July 2023 Correspondence.  

VBA Policy Letter 20-02 Update Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Claims and Appeals Processing Guidance, dated August 27, 2020 and rescinded on June 10, 2023, notes that time extensions were permitted effective March 1, 2020, if a claimant or a claimant's authorized representative requested an extension of a time limit associated with a required action based on the COVID-19 pandemic. The policy letter states:

Where an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, the action required of the claimant must be taken concurrent with or prior to the filing of a request for extension of the time limit. To ensure full consideration of a time limit extension, claimants should note in their request that they are requesting an extension of the time allowed to take the specified action on a claim because of COVID-19, (or any related reference to COVID-19, the coronavirus, national pandemic, or similar language).

The May 2023 Notice of Disagreement did not contain any extension request based on the COVID-19 VBA Policy Letter 20-02. Good cause has not been shown for extending the time to file a VA Form 10182.

In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for a gastrointestinal disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Evidence in the record suggests that the Veteran has been diagnosed with multiple gastrointestinal conditions; therefore, the Board will broadly construe the issue of service connection for small bowel obstruction as a claim for service connection for a gastrointestinal disability (claimed as residuals of small bowel obstruction surgery).  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2009) (holding that the Board must consider any disability that "may reasonably be encompassed by" the description of the claim and symptoms and other submitted information).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a gastrointestinal disability is remanded.

The Veteran contends entitlement to service connection for a gastrointestinal disability, specifically a small bowel obstruction.  See July 2023 VA Form 20-0995.  The Veteran contends that he had surgery while on active duty, and that he currently suffers from "firm bowel movements, gas, and bloating."  See July 2023 Correspondence.

The Veteran underwent a colonoscopy in November 2014 and was advised to eat a high fiber diet and use over the counter treatment for constipation.  See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (receipt date September 25, 2020).  A January 2016 ultrasound note states that the Veteran's pancreas was obscured by intestinal gas.  See id.  In an August 2023 VA treatment note, the Veteran complained of constipation, bloating, and indigestion.  See CAPRI (receipt date October 30, 2023).  He denied abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, or a GI bleed.  See id.

In the January 2024 supplemental claim decision on appeal, the RO found that the Veteran's claimed issue existed prior to military service and that he had been diagnosed with a disability.  These are favorable findings and binding on the Board absent clear and unmistakable error. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran's January 1979 enlistment examination notes that the Veteran had an appendectomy in 1972, and surgery to "unblock intestine" in 1978.  In July 1979, the Veteran complained of cramping and abdominal pain for two to three weeks and reported that his symptoms were the same as when he had the prior bowel obstruction.  The Veteran was referred to and treated by the G.I. and Surgical Clinic at "the hospital" in August 1979. Subsequently, in September 1979, the Veteran was recommended for, and agreed to, separation because he did not meet procurement medical fitness standards. The medical board proceeding noted that the opinion of evaluating physicians was that the conditions existed prior to service.

The Board finds that the failure to obtain the in-service hospital records constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  The Veteran indicated in July 2023 correspondence that he had surgery while on active duty.  The Veteran's service treatment records reflect that the Veteran was seen by G.I. specialists at a hospital around August 1979.  See STR - Medical (receipt date December 22, 2023).  A remand is required to allow VA to request these records.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(a).

The Veteran attended a VA examination in August 2023 and was diagnosed with a history of small bowel obstruction and small bowel obstruction surgery, with a diagnosis date of July 1978, surgical scar, and constipation.  The Veteran reported the condition began in 1979 during basic training.  The Veteran described the symptoms as cramping, nausea, bloating, gas, and severe abdominal pain.  He reported his current symptoms as bloating, nausea, constipation, cramping, abdominal soreness/sharp pain in the abdomen.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's gastrointestinal disability, which clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service, was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated beyond its natural progression by an in-service event.  As her rationale, the examiner explained that there was no evidence of permanent aggravation of the Veteran's pre-existing small bowel obstruction.  

The Board notes that the August 2023 VA examination is inadequate for adjudicative purposes as the examiner did not rely on the appropriate standard to determine whether a pre-existing condition had been aggravated by service.  The standard for determining whether the Veteran's pre-existing condition was worsened or underwent an increase in severity in service beyond the natural progress of the disability must be whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's pre-existing disability was not permanently worsened beyond the natural progress of the disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304; Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).  The standard here requires affirmative evidence, and the examiner's finding that there was "no evidence" of permanent aggravation of the Veteran's pre-existing condition is inadequate.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and therefore a remand is warranted so that an addendum medical opinion may be obtained.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c), 20.802(a).

Finally, the Board notes that the Veteran submitted his VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, before the May 2024 amendments to the Form regarding a Veteran's right to a hearing during the claims process.  The RO did not provide the Veteran with notice of his right to a pre-decisional hearing in connection with his claims in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (d)(1), and such failure is a pre-decisional duty to assist error to satisfy a regulatory or statutory duty.  Accordingly, the Board finds that a remand is required to provide the Veteran with notice of his right to a hearing in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (d)(1). 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the Veteran with notice of his right to a personal hearing in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (d)(1).

2. Obtain records of any inpatient hospital treatment, during the Veteran's active military service, specifically July 1979 - August 1979. Document all requests for information as well as all responses in the claims file.

3. After the development in paragraphs (1) and (2) is complete, obtain an addendum medical opinion from a clinician who, preferably, has not previously examined the Veteran or provided an opinion. If further examination of the Veteran is deemed necessary for the opinion sought, such should be arranged. The entire claims file, to include a copy of this remand, must be made available to the examiner and the examination report should reflect that the file was reviewed. 

Following a review of the entire record, the examiner is asked to provide an opinion as to the following:

(a.) Identify all currently diagnosed gastrointestinal disorders.

(b.) Is it clear and unmistakable (i.e. undebatable) that any currently diagnosed gastrointestinal disability existed prior to the Veteran's entrance into active duty in May 1979?

(c.)  If the answer to (a) is yes, is it also clear and unmistakable (i.e. undebatable) that the Veteran's gastrointestinal disability was NOT aggravated beyond the natural progression during his period of active military service from May 1979 to September 1979?

(d) If the answer to (b) or (c) is no, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's current gastrointestinal disability had its onset in, or is otherwise related to the Veteran's period of active duty service?

In answering these questions, the examiner should discuss the "normal" clinical evaluation of the Veteran's gastrointestinal system upon entrance to service in May 1979 (except for a surgical scar), the medical board proceedings in September 1979 finding that certain gastrointestinal conditions existed prior to service, the Veteran's in-service hospitalization for treatment of a gastrointestinal condition, the Veteran's May 23, 2023 Correspondence, and any relevant VA treatment records.

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for his or her opinion(s).
