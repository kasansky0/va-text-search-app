REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from November 1972 to August 1973.

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier effective date claims

The general statutory and regulatory guidelines for determining the effective date of an award of disability compensation are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application, therefore. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a). In cases involving direct service connection, the effective date will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

Under VA's modernized appeals system, which governs this case, a claimant may "continuously pursue" a claim which has been denied such that the earliest possible effective date can be preserved. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). A claim is continuously pursued when the claimant continues to timely file review options after a decision by the AOJ, the Board, or the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). Id. When the claimant elects to pursue a supplemental claim, it must be filed within one year of the notice of the prior decision, whether it is an AOJ, Board, or Court decision, or within 60 days of the issuance of a SOC or supplemental SOC (SSOC) under the legacy appeals system in order to preserve the effective date of the original claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400 (c)(2). Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h)(1), the effective date of benefit granted to a claimant who has continuously pursued their claim by electing further review will be the date VA received a claimant's initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.

In the event that a supplemental claim is filed outside of this timeline, the claim is not considered to have been continuously pursued and the effective date cannot be earlier than the date of receipt by VA of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h)(2). 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for hepatitis C with residuals of liver transplant 

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for painful scars, anterior trunk 

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for scars, anterior 

4. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for underlying soft tissue damage, anterior trunk is denied.

5. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU 

The Veteran contends the effective dates should be January 2021. See March 2023 brief. 

In a December 2002, December 2011, and November 2015 rating decisions, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim of service connection for hepatitis C. The Veteran did not appeal the decisions and no new and material evidence was submitted within one year of their issuances. The Board finds that the rating decisions are final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c) (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156(b), 20.302, 20.1103 (2015).

The Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ in January 2021. He claimed entitlement to service connection for hepatitis C. In a January 2021 correspondence, the AOJ advised the Veteran that his claim of service connection for hepatitis C had been previously denied and he would have to submit a Supplemental Claim form to process the claim. 

On April 16, 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim, claiming entitlement to service connection for hepatitis C - end stage liver disease.  

The Veteran's claim of service connection for hepatitis C was denied in a May 2021 rating decision, of which he was notified in June 2021. In June 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review, in which he requested review of the rating decision. 

In a February 2022 HLR decision, the claim was returned to the AOJ to obtain a VA examination and opinion regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's hepatitis C. 

In a November 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for hepatitis C and an associated scar from a liver transplant, and assigned an effective date of April 16, 2021, the date of the supplemental claim. 

In February 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim. He requested review of the effective date and ratings assigned in the November 2022 rating decision. The Veteran also contended that he met the threshold percentage requirement for a schedular TDIU since April 16, 2021. 

In a May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for underlying soft tissue damage, anterior trunk and painful scars, anterior trunk, effective April 16, 2021. The AOJ also continued the 30 percent rating for hepatitis C and the noncompensable rating for scars, anterior trunk. Finally, the AOJ granted entitlement to TDIU and DEA, effective April 16, 2021. 

The Veteran submitted a request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) in June 2023, disagreeing with the effective dates assigned in the May 2023 rating decision. 

In a July 2023 HLR decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claims for earlier effective dates. In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the date of claim is April 16, 2021 and an earlier effective date is not warranted based on an earlier date of claim. 

Before February 19, 2019, a Veteran could file a VA Form 21-526EZ to have a claim readjudicated. But, on February 19, 2019, the modernized review system went into effect and claimants could no longer file a VA Form 21-526EZ to readjudicate a claim; instead, a supplemental claim must be filed to readjudicate a previously disallowed benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160 (e).

Under the AMA, a Veteran who wants to readjudicate a claim must file a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. Id. If the supplemental claim does not meet all the requirements of a complete claim, to include the filing of the proper form, the VA may consider the claim to be an incomplete claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d). When a supplemental claim is incomplete under § 3.160 (a), the VA will notify the Veteran of the information necessary to complete the application form. Id. at (d)(1)(i). If the VA receives a complete supplemental claim within 60 days of notice by VA that an incomplete claim was filed, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the incomplete claim. Id. 

In the present case, the Veteran filed a January 2021 application for service connection for hepatitis C on an initial claim form, VA Form 21-526EZ. However, because there is a prior final rating decision, the service connection claim was required to be filed on a supplemental claim form. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. The Veteran was notified in the January 27, 2021 letter that the application was on the incorrect form and that a supplemental application was required.  If VA receives a complete claim within 60 days of notice by VA that an incomplete claim was filed, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the incomplete claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(1)(i). The Veteran submitted the supplemental claim in April 2021. VA did not receive the supplemental claim application within 60 days of the notification; therefore, an earlier effective date is not warranted based on an incomplete claim. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155 (d)(i), 3.160(a).

Additionally, the January 2021 claim form cannot be considered an intent to file because the intent to file rule found in 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b) only applies to initial claims. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (d). 

The Board has considered the effective of Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (March 13, 2025), however, that would not serve to back up the date prior to April 2021 here as TDIU was raised in 2023.

Therefore, as the effective dates currently assigned correspond with the date of receipt of the supplemental claim, they are the earliest effective date allowed by law. Accordingly, the evidence weighs persuasively against the assignment of earlier effective dates. There is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor, and the claims are denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
