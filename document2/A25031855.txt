ORDER

An initial 50 percent rating, but no higher, for bilateral pes planus since February 20, 2021, is granted.

An initial 10 percent rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis since February 20, 2021, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Since February 20, 2021, the Veteran's bilateral pes planus caused extreme tenderness of the plantar surfaces of the feet and was not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances.

2. Since February 20, 2021, the Veteran had bilateral plantar fasciitis. He was recommended for surgical treatment but chose not to undergo surgery.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial rating of 50 percent, but no higher, since February 20, 2021, for bilateral pes planus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 3.326(a), 4.7, 4.10, 4.14, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276.

2. The criteria for an initial rating of 10 percent since February 20, 2021, for bilateral plantar fasciitis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 3.326(a), 4.7, 4.10, 4.14, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5269.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the U.S. Marine Corps from September 1997 to September 2001.

In August 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision granting service connection for plantar fasciitis and combining the Veteran's bilateral pes planus and plantar fasciitis ratings. The AOJ granted a 50 percent rating effective June 23, 2021. 

In September 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20 0996 Decision Review Request:  Higher-Level Review with the rating assigned. In a December 2022 rating decision, the AOJ continued the 50 percent rating. 

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) requesting a higher rating and an earlier effective date for the 50 percent rating and selected the direct review docket. 

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2021 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued that decision, the Board did not consider it in this decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify the evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to rating of more than 30 percent from February 20, 2021, and rating of more than 50 percent since June 23, 2021, for bilateral pes planus and plantar fasciitis.

In February 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ on which he claimed service connection for bilateral pes planus. In a May 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for bilateral pes planus and assigned a 30 percent rating effective February 20, 2021. In June 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ on which he claimed service connection for plantar fasciitis. In an August 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for plantar fasciitis, and recharacterized the Veteran's service-connected disability as bilateral pes planus and plantar fasciitis. The AOJ assigned a 50 percent rating effective June 23, 2021. 

The Board finds that the June 2021 claim was a supplemental claim. A supplemental claim is any complete claim for a VA benefit on an application form prescribed by the Secretary where an initial or supplemental claim for the same or similar benefit on the same or similar basis was previously decided. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(2). A supplemental claim need not be filed on a specific VA form. See Chisholm v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, at *16-*20. The claims were for similar benefits-service connection for feet disorders-and on similar bases-pain of the feet. Therefore, the appeal period begins on February 20, 2021, the date of the Veteran's first claim for service connection.

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing the Veteran's current symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

A noncompensable rating is warranted for mild pes planus with symptoms that are relieved by a built-up shoe or arch support. A 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate bilateral pes planus with weight bearing line over or medial to great toe, inward bowing of the tendo achillis, pain on manipulation and use of the feet. A 30 percent rating is warranted for severe bilateral pes planus with objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use, characteristic callosities. A 50 percent rating is warranted for pronounced bilateral pes planus with marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo achillis on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276.

A 10 percent rating is warranted for unilateral or bilateral plantar fasciitis. A 20 percent rating is warranted for unilateral plantar fasciitis with no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment. A 30 percent rating is warranted for bilateral plantar fasciitis with no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment. Note (1) states that with actual loss of use of the foot, a 40 percent rating is warranted. Note (2) states that if a Veteran has been recommended for surgical intervention, but is not a surgical candidate, plantar fasciitis should be rated under the 20 percent or 30 percent criteria, whichever is applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5269.

Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower evaluation will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided. Separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994).  

On his February 2021 claim, the Veteran asserted that he had pain in his feet and that he had been prescribed shoe inserts. A March 2021 private treatment record stated that the Veteran had arch pain in both feet, and that it was most severe with first weight-bearing and would increase with extended periods of ambulation and weight-bearing. The record stated that the Veteran had a collapse of the medial arch and eversion of the calcaneus. The clinician diagnosed bilateral pes planus and plantar fascial fibromatosis. The clinician stated that the Veteran required custom molded orthotics for lifetime use, and likely would need additional treatment, such as cortisone injections and physical therapy. He was prescribed an anti inflammatory medication.

In April 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. He was diagnosed with bilateral pes planus. The Veteran reported that he used store-bought shoe inserts, and that he was prescribed the anti-inflammatory medication. He reported throbbing and aching foot pain, and tenderness. He reported flare-ups that occurred one to two times per month, which were mild to moderate in severity, and varied in duration. They were caused by prolonged standing or walking and alleviated with rest and medication. The Veteran reported functional loss in that he had difficulty with prolonged standing or walking. The examiner found that the Veteran had pain in both feet that was accentuated with use, and pain on manipulation of the feet. The Veteran did not have swelling, calluses, or extreme tenderness of the plantar surfaces of the feet. He used arch supports in both feet, but he remained symptomatic. He had decreased longitudinal arch height in both feet on weight bearing. He had no evidence of marked deformity or marked pronation in either foot. The weight-bearing line was not over or medial to the great toe, he had no inward bowing of the Achilles' tendon, and he had no marked inward displacement or severe spasm of the Achilles' tendon on manipulation of the feet. The examiner indicated that the Veteran had pain and tenderness which contributed to functional loss in that the Veteran had difficulty with prolonged standing or walking. He also had a lack of endurance. His pain and foot tenderness caused additional functional loss during flare-ups and/or after repeated use over time. He had pain on active motion and on weight-bearing.

A June 2021 VA X-ray study of the right foot indicated borderline pes planus with a calcaneal pitch angle of 17 degrees. An X-ray study of the left foot indicated pes planus with mild degenerative changes along the dorsum of the midfoot.

In July 2021, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination. The examiner diagnosed bilateral pes planus and plantar fasciitis. The Veteran reported that his private podiatrist recommended cortisone injections in his feet, but that the Veteran refused. He also reported that he did not take the anti-inflammatory medication that he was prescribed because of the possible side effects. He stated that he was prescribed orthotic shoe insoles, but that they did not help with his plantar fasciitis foot pain. He was also recommended to get orthotic shoes. He reported that his private podiatrist had recommended foot surgery due to his persistent symptoms, but that he refused to undergo the surgery. The Veteran reported symptoms of pain and burning in the feet. He reported pain on the plantar surface of his foot that was achy, sharp, and stabbing, and that began in his heels and radiated to the distal plantar surface. The pain was worse in the morning or after prolonged standing. The Veteran reported moderate flare-ups two days per week, and that lasted between four and twelve hours. He reported that the pain affected standing at his job at the post office, going up stairs, and walking. It also affected his hobbies of fishing and sports. The examiner found pes planus symptoms of pain in both feet, which was accentuated with use; pain on manipulation of the feet; swelling on use; and no calluses. The Veteran had tried using arch supports, but his pes planus remained symptomatic. He had extreme tenderness of the plantar surfaces on both feet, which was not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances. He had decreased longitudinal arch height of both feet on weight-bearing; no marked deformity; no marked pronation; and the weight-bearing line was not over or medial to the great toe. The Veteran did not have inward bowing of the Achilles' tendon or marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the Achilles' tendon on manipulation of the feet. The examiner found functional loss of the feet due to plantar fasciitis symptoms in that the Veteran was limited in his ability to stand to about one hour, and he had a limited ability to run or climb stairs extensively. The examiner found that the Veteran had not undergone surgical or non-surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis. The examiner noted that the Veteran was recommended for surgery but refused due to apprehension about surgery. The examiner noted additional contributing factors of disability of disturbance of locomotion, interference with standing, pain, fatigue, and lack of endurance. The examiner wrote that the Veteran's feet were easily fatigued and lacked endurance with standing and gait because of pain. The examiner noted additional functional loss during flare-ups and/or after repeated use over time of an inability to standing for more than 15 minutes, an inability to run, and an inability to climb more than 10 stairs.

Since February 20, 2021, the Veteran's pes planus caused, at worst, symptoms of pain including on manipulation of the feet, a burning feeling, swelling, collapse of the medial arch, eversion of the calcaneus, and decreased longitudinal arch height with weight bearing. He had lack of endurance, flare-ups, and functional loss. He used arch supports, but his pes planus remained symptomatic. He had extreme tenderness of the feet, which was not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances. Given these facts, the Board finds that a 50 percent rating is warranted throughout the period on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). In making this determination, the Board has considered, along with the schedular criteria, the Veteran's functional loss due to pain. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206-207 (1995). This is the maximum schedular rating for this disability.

Although the Veteran has requested an increased rating for his bilateral pes planus, including during the period when he was already in receipt of a 50 percent rating, he has not made any argument about why extraschedular referral would be appropriate. He has made no argument or mention that the Veteran's disability picture is so unusual or exceptional that the schedular rating criteria are inadequate to compensate him for his symptoms. Therefore, the Board finds that referral for consideration of a higher rating on an extraschedular basis is not appropriate. See Thun v. Shinseki, 572 F.3d 1366, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  

Since February 20, 2021, the Veteran has had bilateral plantar fasciitis. Although he was recommended for surgery, he chose not to have surgery. Given these facts, a 10 percent rating for plantar fasciitis is warranted throughout the period on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. A 30 percent rating is not warranted because the Veteran has not undergone surgery and, therefore, has not experienced no relief after surgical treatment. Note (2) to diagnostic code 5269 states that a 30 percent could be warranted if the Veteran had been recommended for surgery but was not a surgical candidate. Here, there is no evidence that the Veteran was not a surgical candidate. Instead, he opted to not pursue surgery.

The Board has considered whether the April and July 2021 VA examinations are inadequate due to the examiner not addressing the effect of medication on the severity of the Veteran's symptoms. See Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (March 12, 2025). The Veteran expressly reported that he did not take the anti inflammatory medication which he was prescribed because of the possible side effects. He also stated that he refused cortisone injections recommended by his private podiatrist. Therefore, the symptoms that he reported at the examination were not alleviated by medication and the examiner was able to assess the Veteran's symptom severity without the effects of medication. 

An initial 50 percent rating for bilateral pes planus is granted from February 20, 2021, through June 22, 2021. A rating of more than 50 percent since June 23, 2021, is denied. An initial 10 percent rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis is granted since February 20, 2021.
