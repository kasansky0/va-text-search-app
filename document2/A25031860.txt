ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right eye disability is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for plantar warts is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for left hip impairment is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for right hip impairment is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's right eye disabilities are neither undiagnosed illnesses nor a medically unexplained chronic multi symptom illness (MUCMI), and they did not originate in service or within one year of service and are not etiologically related to service; nor were they caused or worsened by service connected disability.

2. For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected plantar warts were manifested by mild, tender warts, with no compensable scars or other disabling effects.

3. For each hip, the veteran is able to toe-out more than 15 degrees and can cross his legs.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right eye disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 1118, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310, 3.317.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for plantar warts have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7819.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for left hip impairment have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5253.

4. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for right hip impairment have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5253.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from March 1977 to February 1988, from October 2001 to April 2002, and from July 2004 to April 2012.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), where a condition in service is noted but is not, in fact, chronic, or where a diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned. The continuity of symptomatology provision of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) has been interpreted as an alternative to service connection only for the specific chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Walker v. Shinseki, 718 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may also be established with certain chronic diseases based upon a legal presumption by showing that the disorder manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent disabling or more within one year from the date of separation from service. Such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.

Service connection may be awarded on a presumptive basis to a Persian Gulf veteran who (1) exhibits objective indications; (2) of a chronic disability such as those listed in paragraph (b) of 38 C.F.R. § 3.317; (3) which became manifest either during active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, or to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than December 31, 2016; and (4) such symptomatology by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis. Gutierrez v. Principi, 19 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2004); 38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317; 76 Fed. Reg. 81834 -81836 (Dec. 29, 2011).

Objective indications of a chronic disability include both "signs," in the medical sense of objective evidence perceptible to an examining physician, and other, non-medical indicators that are capable of independent verification. Disabilities that have existed for six months or more and disabilities that exhibit intermittent episodes of improvement and worsening over a six-month period will be considered chronic. The six-month period of chronicity will be measured from the earliest date on which the pertinent evidence establishes that the signs or symptoms of the disability first became manifest.

A chronic disability resulting from an undiagnosed illness referred to in this section shall be rated using evaluation criteria from the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities for a disease or injury in which the functions affected, anatomical localization, or symptomatology are similar. A disability referred to in this section shall be considered service-connected for the purposes of all laws in the United States. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(3-5).

Signs or symptoms which may be manifestations of an undiagnosed illness include, but are not limited to, fatigue, signs or symptoms involving the skin, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, neurologic signs or symptoms, neuropsychological signs or symptoms, signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or lower), sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal signs or symptoms, cardiovascular signs or symptoms, abnormal weight loss, or menstrual disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(b).

In addition to certain chronic disabilities from undiagnosed illness, service connection may also be given for medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness (such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome) that is defined by a cluster of signs and symptoms, as well as for any diagnosed illness that the VA Secretary determines by regulation warrants a presumption of service connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(i)(B).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right eye disability

The Veteran contends that his right eye disability was caused by exposures related to his service in Persian Gulf War. 

Service treatment records demonstrated that the Veteran wore glasses and had an eyewear prescription. In a December 1978 eye history survey, the Veteran self-reported wearing glasses to see distance. He denied having glaucoma, cataracts, eye injuries, or eye surgery. In May 1981, the Veteran got hydraulic fluid in both eyes with no abrasions. In an April 1982 report of medical history, the Veteran self-reported having eye trouble and wearing glasses. The clinician noted that the Veteran wore corrective lenses. 

VA treatment records demonstrated that the Veteran wore glasses for visions issues.

Private treatment records demonstrated vision problems, such as blurriness. A May 2023 ophthalmology note stated that the Veteran had surgery to remove an age-related cataract in the right eye. The Veteran was diagnosed with macular degeneration in 2015, epiretinal membrane in 2023, and pseudophakia in 2023. 

A December 2022 VA memo verified that the Veteran had military service that constituted presumptive toxic exposure pursuant to 38 U.S.C. §1119.

A January 2023 VA memo verified that the Veteran meets the definition of a "Persian Gulf Veteran" based on his service in Iraq from November 2009 to December 2009 and Kuwait from December 2009 to June 2009. 

During a September 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted a diagnosis of right eye epiretinal membrane established in 2023, macular degeneration in both eyes established in 2015, and right eye pseudophakia established in 2023. The examiner noted a prior history of retinal detachment and central serous retinopathy, which were both resolved. The examiner opined that the Veteran's right eye disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by service. The examiner stated that the Veteran's diagnoses were age related, and there were no events in his records that would cause his diagnoses. 

An October 2023 memo verified Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER) entries for activity carried out by the Veteran while on active duty involving toxic exposure to occupational or environmental hazards. The Veteran's ILER report documented evidence of exposure over permissible limits. The Veteran had Persian Gulf War service pursuant to 38 U.S.C. §1117. The Veteran was a block 18 soldier receiving imminent danger pay for serving in Kuwait and Iraq from January 6, 2005, to December 8, 2005. Department of defense deployment records showed that the Veteran served in Djibouti from December 1, 2007, through June 30, 2008; Iraq from November 17, 2009, through December 14, 2009; and Kuwait from December 15, 2009, through June 2, 2009. The Veteran received fire pay, imminent danger pay, and/or hazardous duty pay for service in Kuwait January 2005; Djibouti from December 2007 to June 2008; and Kuwait from November 2009 through June 2010. The memo also verified evidence of other deployment related exposures, which was Kropyvnytskyi municipal water from January 1, 1996, to November 13, 2019. 

During a November 2023 VA opinion regarding TERAs, the examiner opined that the Veteran's right eye disability was less likely than not caused by TERAs after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran. The examiner reviewed the Veteran's exposures in Gulf War service areas along with burn pits while stationed in Kuwait and Iraq. The examiner noted that the reported activity included Light Missile Field Artillery. The Veteran was exposed from November 2009 to June 2010 daily by means of inhalation and dermal without personal protective equipment. The examiner stated that risk factors included hereditary, congenital, smoking history, weight, and lab findings. The examiner stated that the Veteran's risk factors far outweigh the factors identified in the TERA, and his right eye disability was due to natural aging and not toxic exposures in service. 

As an initial matter, while the Board acknowledges that the Veteran has qualifying service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations and is therefore considered to be a Persian Gulf War Veteran, his claimed right eye disabilities have been attributed to known clinical and understood etiologies. As such, none of the claimed disabilities are considered to be an undiagnosed illness or an indicator of an unexplained multi-symptom illness, and, thus, may not be presumed to be related to the Veteran's Persian Gulf service under provisions applicable to undiagnosed illness or unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.

To that end, the Board notes that epiretinal membrane, macular degeneration, and pseudophakia do not qualify as one of the chronic disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317. Consequently, presumptive service connection due to Persian Gulf War service is not applicable here. However, the Veteran may still qualify for service connection on a direct basis. See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

With respect to entitlement on a direct basis, to include exposure based on TERAs, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's service treatment records did not provide diagnoses of epiretinal membrane, macular degeneration, or pseudophakia, and the Veteran does not contend that he had a diagnosis or treatment during active service. Indeed, the Veteran indicated that he did not seek treatment for his right eye outside of wearing glasses for seeing distance. The earliest indication related to the Veteran's right eye disabilities is in 2015, which was years after separation. Thus, there is no indication of continuity of symptoms since service or that the Veteran's right eye disabilities manifested to a compensable degree within one year of his separation from his active military service.

Moreover, there is no probative medical opinion of record indicating that the Veteran's right eye disabilities were incurred in or caused by his active service, to include any incident or exposure event. Indeed, the only medical opinions of record were against the Veteran's claim finding that it was less likely than not that his right eye disabilities were related to service, to include any TERA exposures during his deployments. The September 2023 and November 2023 examiners fully reviewed the Veteran's military records, medical records, and appropriate literature. The Board affords the September 2023 and November 2023 opinions probative value as they are supported by sound rationale and corroborated by the record. Thus, the Board finds no documentation supporting a relationship between the Veteran's right eye disabilities and active service, and the Veteran has not provided a medical opinion nor any evidence to the contrary. 

The Board has considered the Veteran's assertions that his right eye disabilities were caused by his TERAs. The Board notes, however, that there is no medical evidence to support this assertion. While the Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to report on his symptoms and the history of those symptoms, the questions of causation of epiretinal membrane, macular degeneration, or pseudophakia extend beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship. As the Veteran is not shown to possess the medical training to render competent opinions about such specialized medical matters, the Veteran is not competent to address the diagnosis or etiology of his right eye disabilities. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F. 3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Thus, the Board affords no probative value to the Veteran's lay statements to the extent he provides an etiological opinion. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against a grant of service connection for right eye disabilities. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable, and service connection must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability ratings is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body, to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria required for that particular rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, that reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

2. Entitlement to a compensable rating for plantar warts

The Veteran contends that his plantar warts warrant a compensable rating. The Veteran is currently in receipt of a noncompensable rating for his service connected plantar warts pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7819. 

Under Diagnostic Code 7819, benign skin neoplasms are rated as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800), scars (DCs 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), or impairment of function. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7819.

Under the General Rating Formula for the Skin, a 10 percent rating requires at least one of the following to be present: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period. A 30 percent rating requires at least one of the following is present: characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period. A 60 percent rating requires characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.

Under the revised VA regulations, it is explicitly stated that for the purposes of the skin disability ratings, "systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin." 38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).

VA treatment records demonstrated that the Veteran had hard lesions on the bottom of his foot pursuant to a February 2014 physical examination. He did not complain of symptoms nor receive medical treatment for his plantar warts. 

During a September 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted a diagnosis of plantar warts bilaterally on the feet established in 2012. The Veteran had not been treated with medication within the prior 12 months. The Veteran had not received any treatments or procedures other than systemic or topical within the prior 12 months. The examiner noted that none of the Veteran's total body area was covered in warts. He does not have a benign or malignant neoplasm or metastases. The Veteran does not have scars, pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, or symptoms related to his plantar warts. 

After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that a compensable rating is not warranted for the Veteran's service-connected plantar warts. In this regard, as noted above, to receive a compensable rating for plantar warts under the General Rating Formula of the Skin, there would need to be a showing that more nearly approximates at least one of the following to be present: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period. Here, the Veteran was noted to have characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent, with no exposed areas, and no medical treatment. Thus, a compensable rating is not warranted under the General Rating Formula for the Skin for the Veteran's service-connected plantar warts. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7819.

The Board notes that the Veteran is certainly competent to report symptoms that he experiences. However, VA must weigh his statements against the factors as enumerated in the rating criteria discussed above, which in part involves the examination of clinical data gathered by competent medical professionals. Further, the Veteran is not competent to provide an opinion regarding the severity of his symptomatology in accordance with the rating criteria. See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007). Therefore, to the extent that the Veteran asserts that he experienced symptoms warranting a higher disability rating, the Board finds that this statement is outweighed by that of the medical evidence.

Hence, it is the determination of the Board that there is no evidence of pain or instability, nor did it cause the Veteran any functional impairment. As such a compensable evaluation is not warranted. As the persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim for a higher rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application, and the Veteran's claim is denied. See Lynch, 21 F.4 th 776; 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

3. Entitlement to a compensable rating for left hip impairment

4. Entitlement to a compensable rating for right hip impairment

The Veteran contends that his service-connected bilateral hip impairment warrants a compensable rating. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran has been in receipt of a noncompensable for a left hip impairment and a right hip impairment effective June 8, 2023. 

Notably, the Veteran is also in receipt of a noncompensable rating for left hip extension and right hip extension. However, the Veteran has not appealed those ratings or otherwise indicated that a higher rating is warranted. Thus, the issue of whether a compensable rating is warranted for left hip extension and right hip extension is not currently on appeal.

Diagnostic Codes 5251 through 5253, provide rating criteria for limitation of motion of the hip and thigh. Under Diagnostic Code 5253, impairment of the thigh may be rated based on limitation of abduction, limitation of adduction, or limitation of rotation. A 10 percent rating will be assigned for limitation of rotation where the individual cannot toe-out more than 15 degrees on the affected leg, or for limitation of adduction where the individual cannot cross the legs. A 20 percent rating will be assigned for limitation of abduction where there is motion lost beyond 10 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5253.

VA treatment records demonstrated that the Veteran received physical therapy for his back, hips, and knees. The treatment plan was to stretch and work on flexibility. During a March 2016 initial physical therapy consult, the clinician noted bilateral hip flexor tightness. 

During a September 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran had a diagnosis of bilateral hip strain. The Veteran reported bilateral anterior and posterior hip pain that occurred intermittently with movement. The Veteran denied flareups. The Veteran reported limitations lying on his side, turning from side to side, bending, stooping, pushing, carrying, standing, sitting, walking, climbing stairs, running, squatting, and driving. The examiner measured the Veteran's bilateral active range of motion: flexion was 100 degrees; extension was 30 degrees; abduction was 35 degrees; adduction was 20 degrees; external rotation was 40 degrees; and internal rotation was 25. The Veteran could cross his legs. The examiner observed bilateral pain with flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, external rotation, and internal rotation. The Veteran's passive range of motion was the same as his active range of motion bilaterally. The Veteran had pain bilaterally with weight-bearing, active motion, and passive motion, which did not result in functional loss. The examiner did not observe crepitus, localized tenderness, or pain on palpation. The Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing without any additional loss of function or range of motion. After repeated use, the examiner stated that the Veteran would have pain causing additional loss of rang of motion. The examiner estimated the Veteran's bilateral range of motion after repeated use: flexion was 95 degrees; extension was 25 degrees; abduction was 30 degrees; adduction was 15 degrees; external rotation was 35 degrees; and internal rotation was 20 degrees. The Veteran could cross his legs. The Veteran did not have additional factors contributing to his disability. The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy, ankylosis, malunion or nonunion of the femur, flail hip, or leg length discrepancy. The Veteran did not use an assistive device. 

Turning to the evidence of record pertinent to the period on appeal, as a preliminary matter, the Board notes that the Veteran's bilateral hip disabilities have never manifested by ankylosis, and evidence throughout the period on appeal has not demonstrated a flail joint or impairment of the femur (to include fractures or malunion). The VA examiners specifically found that these conditions were not present, and the Board finds that Diagnostic Codes 5250, 5254, and 5255 are not for application in this case. Instead, the Board must determine whether increased ratings are warranted for the Veteran's bilateral hip disability under Diagnostic Code 5253 pertaining to impairment of the thigh.

Additionally, a compensable rating for impairment of either the right or left thigh is not warranted. In this regard, at worst, the VA examination indicate that the Veteran was capable of toe-out more than 15 degrees and could cross his legs. 

The Board has also considered whether there is any additional functional loss not contemplated by the ratings assigned. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; see also Deluca, 8 Vet. App. at 206; Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 33 (2011). Although the Veteran's bilateral hip disabilities resulted in pain, there is no evidence of record indicating that it caused functional impairment more closely approximating higher disability ratings based on limitation of flexion, extension, or abduction. See Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 33. Indeed, even based on the Veteran's report of pain, there is no indication that the Veteran's bilateral hip disabilities were so disabling as to approximate the level of impairment required for assignment of higher ratings under the impairment criteria at any time during the period on appeal.

Accordingly, a compensable evaluation is not warranted. As the persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim for a higher rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application, and the Veteran's claim is denied. See Lynch, 21 F.4 th 776; 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
