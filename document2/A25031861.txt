CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for erectile dysfunction have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.6, 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1990 to March 1991.  He also had periods of Active Duty for Training and Inactive Duty for Training in the Air Force National Guard from 1970 to 1997.

This case is on appeal from a May 2023 rating decision.  See May 22, 2023, rating decision, in which the RO found new and relevant evidence and then confirmed and continued the prior denial of these claims.  See also RO's May 24, 2023, notification to the Veteran of the May 22, 2023, rating decision; and the Veteran's June 14, 2023, VA Form 10182-Board Appeal.  

In Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held the Board should not adjudicate an appeal until the time for the appellant to switch Board dockets has ended.  This period ends either one year from the date the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever date is later.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  Here, the Board may proceed with adjudication because a docket switch is not possible as the Veteran already had a Board hearing within the applicable time window.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302.  See also December 12, 2024, Board Hearing Transcript.  

As just noted, the Veteran testified regarding his claims before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge during a December 2024 Board Hearing.  See December 12, 2024, Board Hearing Transcript.  Accordingly, the evidence for review in this decision consists of all of the evidence of record at the time of the May 22, 2023, rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the December 12, 2024, Board Hearing or within the 90 day period after the December 12, 2024, Board Hearing (that is, from December 12, 2024, until March 12, 2025).  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

1. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction

The Veteran is requesting service connection for erectile dysfunction, which he posits may be secondary to his service-connected cyst -right testicle, status post spermatocelectomy disability.  See Veteran's January 30, 2023, VA Form VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim.  See also December 12, 2023, Board Hearing Transcript, p.11.   

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  A veteran seeking compensation under these provisions must establish three elements: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

Service connection may also be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

"Congress specifically limits entitlement to service-connected disease or injury where such cases have resulted in a disability.  In the absence of a proof of present disability there can be no claim."  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) (internal citation omitted).  The requirement of a "current disability" is satisfied if a disorder is present at the time a claim is filed or at any time during the pendency of the appeal; service connection may be awarded even though the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim.  See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  A formal diagnosis is not required where the veteran provides competent lay evidence of pain that causes functional impairment of earning capacity.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  The standard is whether a disability exists at the time the claim was filed.  See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 293 (2013).

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) contain numerous accounts of issues involving the male genitalia.  See, e.g., STRs dated June 20, 1973; March 13, 1975; March 13, 1976; and September 21, 1978.  

Moreover, the Veteran presently has a confirmed diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.  See, e.g., January 14, 2010, VA Genitourinary examination report, p. 5.  

The question then is whether service connection for erectile dysfunction is warranted.  For the reasons that follow the Board finds that it is.

As stated before, on VA Genitourinary/ Male Reproductive Organ Conditions examination in January 2010 (and again in November 2013 and March 2015), the diagnosis was erectile dysfunction; however, a direct nexus opinion was not provided, with each examiner instead stating that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was not secondary to the Veteran's service-connected right testicle cyst status post spermatocelectomy disability.  This opposes an award of service connection under the propounded secondary theory of entitlement.  

Thereafter, and subsequent to the Veteran's January 2023 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental claim for service connection, the Veteran was afforded another VA Male Reproductive Organ Conditions examination in May 2023.  See May 3, 2003, VA Male Reproductive Organ Conditions examination report.  The examiner (a physician) patiently explained why the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was "no[t] likely due to either a spermatocele or a spermatocelectomy," but he then then averred: "The veteran had erectile dysfunction even before the spermatocelectomy."  See May 3, 2023, VA examination opinion, p. 2.  This latter declaration supports an award of service connection on a direct basis (as the examiner has intimated that the information in the STRs is reflective of erectile dysfunction around the same time that the presently service-connected testicle cyst was discovered), and there is no medical opinion evidence to the contrary.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.6.  See also Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991) (holding that the Board must consider only independent medical evidence to support its findings rather than provide its own medical judgment).  

The Board accordingly finds that the evidence favors the claim of service connection on a direct basis.  Service connection for erectile dysfunction is thus warranted and the appeal is granted.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for throat cancer is remanded.

The Veteran is also requesting service connection for throat cancer.  See Veteran's January 30, 2023, VA Form VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim.  During examinations that were subsequently done by VA in 2023 the Veteran evidently reported that he was deployed to Kuwait during the Gulf War and "was deployed to combat areas in Vietnam" (see page 5 of a March 2, 2023, VA Hearing Loss and Tinnitus examination report, and page 3 of a May 3, 2023, VA examination opinion regarding service connection for Throat Cancer); and according to the May 2023 Throat examiner, the Veteran's throat cancer is at least as likely as not related to the toxins that the Veteran was exposed to while he was in Kuwait.  See May 3, 2023, VA Throat Cancer examination opinion, p. 3. 

VA regulations provide for service connection on a presumptive basis for certain rare cancers associated with exposure to fine particulate matter where a Veteran  has a qualifying period of service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.320.  There is also a presumption of service connection for certain cancers, including of the head, neck, and respiratory system which may be associated with exposure to burn pits and other toxins during service.  See 38 U.S.C.§§ 1119-1120; Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act).

This was the information and evidence at the time of the May 22, 2023, rating decision that is the subject of this appeal.  There is, however, no record of such service in the Veteran's claims file.  In this regard the Board notes that the RO does appear to have attempted to obtain corroborative records in 2013 (and earlier), but the name provided by the RO in its search was not entirely accurate, whereupon the service department responded:  

THERE ARE NO RECORDS AT CODE 13 FOR THIS PERSON. SUGGEST YOU USE DPRIS WEB TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM OFFICIAL MILITARY PERSONNEL FOLDERS IN THE CUSTODY OF THE DEPARTMENT OFDEFENSE

See March 6, 2013, response from the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC).

Unfortunately, the RO did not resume its request for these records before its May 22, 2023, denial of the claims.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2), which provides that VA will make as many requests as are necessary to obtain relevant records from a Federal department or agency.  

Said failure by the RO to take additional corroborative action before its May 2023 denial of the claims was especially remiss since the May 2023 examiner has opined that the Veteran's throat cancer may be related to "daily exposure" to "inhaled toxins daily while in Kuwait;" and that the Veteran's complained of neck pain is "residuals of right radical neck dissection."  See page 3 of the May 3, 2023, VA opinion regarding service connection for Throat Cancer; and page 2 of the examiner's May 3, 2023, VA Neck/Cervical Spine examination opinion.   

Nor has the Veteran presented corroborative evidence of such service during an allowable post-decision evidentiary window.  

Remand for correction of the RO's pre-decisional duty to assist error is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  See also Suttman v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 127, 132 (1993) (holding that the "Board may not simply ignore an issue so raised").

2. Entitlement to service connection for a neck/cervical spine disorder is remanded.

The Veteran is also requesting service connection for a neck/cervical spine condition (see Veteran's January 30, 2023, VA Form VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim); and on VA Neck/Cervical Spine examination in May 2023 the examiner averred:

his neck complaints are all right lateral neck pain/stiffness related to his right radical neck dissection and do not related to cervical disc disease or other musculoskeletal conditions of the neck.  

See May 3, 2023, VA Neck/Cervical Spine examination opinion, p. 2.  This supports an award of service connection on a secondary basis.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; see also Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991) (holding that the Board must consider only independent medical evidence to support its findings rather than provide its own medical judgment).  

Inasmuch as the Veteran's neck/cervical spine complaints have been inextricably linked with the pending claim for throat cancer it too is remanded until the claim for throat cancer is resolved.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (holding that two issues are "inextricably intertwined" when they are so closely tied together that a final Board decision cannot be rendered unless both issues have been considered).

3. Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder is remanded.

The Veteran is also requesting service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety and depression, and PTSD (see Veteran's January 30, 2023, VA Form VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim; and an earlier statement submitted by the Veteran in June 2010); and in March 2023 he was afforded a VA examination.  See March 20, 2023, VA Mental Disorders examination report.  A singular diagnosis of "Unspecified Anxiety Disorder" was returned that the examiner said was likely not related to service.  See March 20, 2023, VA Mental Disorders examination report, pp. 1-2.  The VA examiner expounded:

Veteran's Unspecified Anxiety Disorder meets DSM criteria, but there is no evidence that it is related to the Veteran's military service. There is no report of mental health issues during the Veteran's service time and no consistent report of ongoing mental health problems since military service.

See March 20, 2023, VA Mental Disorders examination opinion, p. 2.  However, the examiner neglected to mention that the Veteran had been diagnosed with and treated for PTSD after his separation from service.  See, e.g., letter from private practitioner M.G. that was received by VA on September 25, 2013.  See also Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121, 124 (1991) (holding that the duty to assist includes "the conduct of a thorough and contemporaneous medical examination, one which takes into account the records of prior medical treatment, so that the evaluation of the claimed disability will be a fully informed one"); Caffrey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 377, 381 (1994) (holding that the examiner "must consider the records of prior medical examinations and treatment in order to assure a fully informed examination").    

This was the information and evidence at the time of the May 22, 2023, rating decision on appeal and in light of such the RO should have requested a new examination per 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) but did not do so - a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232, 243 (2019) (holding that the Board cannot uncritically adopt an examiner's opinion as its own without reconciling that opinion with the other evidence of record).  Remand for correction of this pre-decisional duty to assist error is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  See also Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 12 (2001) (emphasizing the Board's duty to return an inadequate examination report "if further evidence or clarification of the evidence or correction of a procedural defect is essential for a proper appellate decision.").

In so finding, the Board notes that the Veteran apparently submitted an opinion from a private psychologist that was received by VA on March 12, 2025; during a permissible evidentiary window.  See February 28, 2015, opinion from Dr. S.L.R., who noted that in addition to periods of active-duty periods for training the Veteran was "activated for combat during the Gulf War in 1990 and went to Korea," and that the Veteran had a DSM-5 diagnosis of "Unspecified Anxiety Disorder."  Dr. S.L.R. also documented the Veteran as stating, "It all started when I was on active duty. I have never been around anybody that had died. I was flying in 1979 as a fighter interceptor at Ellington AFB."  Dr. S.L.R. then averred that the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder "is due to the traumatic experience he had while in the military."  However, and regarding the Veteran's contention of active duty service, military records do not show that he was on active duty in 1979; on the contrary, they show that he was employed as commercial airline pilot.  See, e.g., Veteran's Air National Guard records dated November 10, 1982, and February 16, 1995.  See also LeShore v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 406, 409 (1995)(holding that a bare transcription of lay history . . . is not competent medical evidence merely because the transcriber is a health care professional).  

Nor did Dr. S.L.R. provide the precise date when the Veteran's current clinically diagnosed "unspecified anxiety disorder" initially presented/first manifested - an omission of essential diagnostic information that is needed in this case since the Veteran was a National Guardsman.  See, e.g., Military Personnel Records that were received by VA on December 17, 2008.  See also 38 C.F.R. §§  3.1(k), 3.1(m), and 3.6(a) regarding duty periods and incurrence of disability.  See also Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991) (holding that the Board must consider only independent medical evidence to support its findings rather than provide its own medical judgment).  

Consequently, this seemingly favorable evidence that has been proffered by the Veteran during a post-decisional permissible evidentiary window is not sufficient for favorable resolution of the claim for a psychiatric disorder at this time.  However, and as stated before, additional action by the RO to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error is required.

4. Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is remanded.

5. Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is remanded.

The Veteran is also requesting service connection for left and right ear hearing loss (see Veteran's January 30, 2023, VA Form VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim); and in March 2023 he was afforded a VA examination.  See March 2, 2023, VA Hearing Loss and Tinnitus examination report.  The diagnosis was left and right ear sensorineural hearing loss that the examiner said was likely not related to service or military noise exposure because "USAF-NG evaluation (10-Sep-94) revealed normal thresholds three (3) years post-discharge" and because "there is no report of complaint/treatment for hearing decrease in STRs or at separation."  See March 2, 2023, VA Hearing Loss and Tinnitus examination report, pp. 3-4.  The Board observes that the examiner's justification is contracted by evidence in the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) which the examiner did not acknowledge.  See, e.g., service treatment records (STRs) dated  September 7, 1979; October 1, 1983; and November 18, 1988, which show highly elevated auditory thresholds; and an STR dated January 31, 1991, which reads: "c/o . . . diff hearing bilat ear."  See also Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232, 243 (2019) (holding that the Board cannot uncritically adopt an examiner's opinion as its own without reconciling that opinion with the other evidence of record).  

This was the information and evidence at the time of the May 22, 2023, rating decision on appeal and in light of such the RO should have requested a new examination but did not do so - a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See Caffrey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 377, 381 (1994) (holding that the examiner "must consider the records of prior medical examinations and treatment in order to assure a fully informed examination").  See also Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that an opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value); Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 107 (2012) ("If the opinion is based on an inaccurate factual premise, then it is correct to discount it entirely.").  Remand for correction of this pre-decisional duty to assist error is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Attempt to verify the Veteran's claim of wartime service in the Persian Gulf -Kuwait.  Document all efforts taken to verify this contention; and associate all corroborative records with the claims file.  Once this action is completed make a formal finding for the record.

2. Attempt to verify the Veteran's claim of wartime service in Vietnam.  Document all steps.  Document all efforts taken to verify this contention; and associate all corroborative records with the claims file.  Once this action is completed make a formal finding for the record.

3. After completion of steps 1 and 2, schedule the Veteran for a new VA examination regarding the issue of service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include/variously claimed as anxiety, depression, and PTSD.  The examiner must review the claim file and note that the claim file was reviewed; and clinically examine the Veteran.  

The examiner is then asked to respond to the following:

(a.) Provide the diagnosis for all current psychiatric disorders.  

(b.) If the Veteran previously had a psychiatric disorder that is no longer manifest, when did that condition resolve?

(c.) For each current disorder, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that it

i.	began during the Veteran's active duty service; or

ii.	is related to some incident of the Veteran's active duty service; or

iii.	is a disease that began /first presented during a discrete period of active duty for training.  If the response to this query is affirmative, provide the precise date that this clinically diagnosed disorder began.

(d.) If PTSD is diagnosed, please identify the stressor(s) upon which the diagnosis is based.

A discussion of the facts and medical principles involved will be of considerable assistance to the Board.  

In answering these questions, the examiner is asked to consider all statements from the Veteran regarding his military experiences and history of symptoms, including during service.  The examiner is asked to explain why the Veteran's statements make it more or less likely that a current condition started during service.  If indicated, it should be explained whether there is a medical reason to believe that the Veteran's recollection of his symptoms during and after service may be inaccurate or not medically supported as the onset or cause of his current diagnosis or diagnoses.

The examiner should not rely on silence in the medical records unless it can be explained: (a) why the silence in the available records can be taken as proof that the symptom(s) did not occur, including why the fact would have normally been recorded if present, or (b) why the absence of medical records is medically significant.

4. Schedule the Veteran for a new VA examination by an appropriate clinician regarding the issue of service connection for left ear hearing loss and right ear hearing loss.  In performance of this examination the examiner must: 

(a.) review the claim file and note that the claim file was reviewed; 

(b.) discuss the Veteran's military noise exposure(s) and hearing issues with the Veteran and include a synopsis of the Veteran's contentions in the examination report; and

(c.) clinically examine the Veteran and report all findings in detail.  

(d.) The examiner is then requested to opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's left and right ear hearing loss 

i.	began during the Veteran's active duty service.

ii.	is related to some incident of the Veteran's active duty service, to include the Veteran's exposure to loud noises during such service.

iii.	became manifest within one year of the Veteran's separation from active duty service. [See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a), 3.309(a)].

iv.	began during a period of Active Duty for Training.  If the response to this query is affirmative, opine as to the precise date of onset.

v.	Commenced as an injury during a period of Inactive Duty for Training.  If the response to this query is affirmative, provide the precise date of this injury.  

A discussion of the facts and medical principles involved will be of considerable assistance to the Board.  The examiner must discuss the numerous accounts of highly elevated hearing thresholds that are in the service treatment records (STRs), and the subjective account of difficulty hearing that is also in the STRs.  

In answering these questions, the examiner is asked to consider all statements from the Veteran regarding his history of symptoms, especially during service.  The examiner is asked to explain why the Veteran's statements make it more or less likely that a current condition started during service.  If indicated, it should be explained whether there is a medical reason to believe that the Veteran's recollection of his symptoms during and after service may be inaccurate or not medically supported as the onset or cause of his current diagnosis.

The examiner should not rely on silence in the medical records unless it can be explained: (a) why the silence in the available records can be taken as proof that the symptom(s) did not occur, including why the fact would have normally been recorded if present, or (b) why the absence of medical records is medically significant.
