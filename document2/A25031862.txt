DOCKET NO. 210616-166347
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In April 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Appellant's representative that he desired to withdraw his appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal by the Appellant's authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1978 to May 1981.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a April 2021 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

An effective withdrawal of a claim on appeal must be in writing, include the name of the veteran (or claimant or appellant if other than the veteran), the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 5-7 (2020); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. Hembree, 33 Vet. App. 5.

Here, the Appellant's representative submitted the letter in April 2025 requesting withdrawal of the pending claim before the VA, withdrawing the appeal in its entirety.

The statement of withdrawal contained the Appellant's name, claim number, and a specific indication that he wished to withdraw the claim on appeal.  Id.  There remains no allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration with regard to the claim and the issue of service connection for PTSD must be dismissed. See 38 C.F.R. §20.205; Hembree, 33 Vet. App. 5-7.
