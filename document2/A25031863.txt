DOCKET NO. 240724-458122
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for generalized headaches is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least approximately balanced as to whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed headache disability began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for headaches have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran has active service from September 1995 to September 2015.  

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA was implemented effective February 19, 2019 and automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).

The rating decision was issued after the implementation of AMA. A July 24, 2024 VA Form 10182 was received, so this decision is drafted in accordance with AMA. The Veteran elected direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (07/24/2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement).    

Under the AMA, when a claimant seeks appellate review through the Board's Direct Review docket, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

In general, the Board is bound by favorable findings in the Rating Decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a). 

In this case, the favorable findings include the Veteran's diagnosis with generalized headaches (03/07/2024 Rating Decision - Narrative, pg. 3).    

The Board notes the Veteran's claim of service connection for headaches as secondary to sleep apnea was denied in February 2022 (02/26/2022 Rating Decision - Narrative). The Veteran did not appeal the decision, and it became final. 

A final decision may be readjudicated if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to a supplemental claim. If new and relevant evidence is presented, the Secretary shall readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d). 

In June 2023, the Veteran offered a new theory of entitlement, contending that he had chronic headaches/migraines beginning in January 2023, with a frequency of 2 or 3 per week lasting from 1 to 2 days in duration. The Veteran cited to the PACT Act (06/25/2023	VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, pg. 3). 

By its March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ readjudicated the claim for service connection for headaches. In doing so, the Board finds the AOJ implicitly found new and relevant evidence was submitted, warranting readjudication of the claims. The Board is bound by this favorable finding and will not further address the matter of whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted. AMA, Pub. L. No. 115-55, § 5104A, 131 Stat. 1105, 1106-07.

Service Connection for Headaches.

The Veteran has claimed entitlement to service connection for headaches. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a). Secondary service connection may be established for a nonservice-connected disability which is aggravated by a service-connected disability. In such an instance, the Veteran may be compensated for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (b); see Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

The Veteran reported that his headaches began after having been hit in the head with a hatch in 2007>  He did not seek medical attention at that time (09/16/2023 C&P Exam, pg. 2; 11/13/2023 C&P Exam, pg. 2). 

Alternatively, he contends his headaches are due to exposure to TERA. TERA participation is conceded (12/04/2023 other; 06/25/2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, pg. 3).

In light of the favorable findings, the question before the Board is whether there is a causal relationship between the Veteran's diagnosed headaches and an in-service disease or injury, or as a chronic disease, manifested to a compensable degree within 1 year from the date of separation from service.

Frequently throughout service, to include during his March 2012 post deployment assessment and in September 2015 prior to separation, the Veteran denied headaches (11/13/2015 STR, pg. 153; 11/13/2015 STR, pg. 84). However, he was treated for headaches on a few occasions during service (11/13/2015 STR, pgs. 105 and 109). 

The Veteran was afforded a September 2023 VA examination for headaches. (09/16/2023 C&P Exam). After an in-person examination and review of the records and VA e-folder, the examiner provided a positive nexus opinion. 

The examiner considered the Veteran's account of experiencing head pain, nausea, and light sensitivity, in service. The examiner found evidence of chronicity since, and a nexus to service, describing present symptoms that have continued since service. 

The Veteran was also afforded a November 2023 VA examination for headaches (11/13/2023 C&P Exam). The examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of generalized headaches, opining they were less likely than not caused by the toxic exposure risk activities.

The examiner noted other risk factors including sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety. After considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran, the examiner found risk factors outside of military service (sleep apnea, anxiety, depression, multifactorial) outweigh the factors identified literature addressing TERA.

While not addressed by the November 2023 examiner, the Board acknowledges the Veteran is service connected for sleep apnea and depressive disorder with anxious distress (02/22/2023 Rating Decision - Codesheet).

An addendum opinion of February 2024 is of record (02/08/2024 C&P Exam). The examiner provided a negative nexus opinion after considering the Veteran's period of service and conflicting dates of diagnoses and onset of headaches. The examiner acknowledged a note that the Veteran had intermittent headaches since 2007, but concluded this note is not substantiated by objective evidence in the medical record. 

The medical opinions for and against the Veteran's claim have been considered and weighed against each other. The Board finds the September 2023 opinion was the most grounded in the Veteran's service history, accurate medical history, and considered the Veteran's lay statements and statements as to onset. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

Although the November 2023 and February 2024 opinions were against the Veteran's claim, neither examiner provided a reason to find the Veteran's lay statements as to his symptoms, the described head injury, or onset not credible. 

After review and consideration of the medical evidence, to include service treatment and VA examinations, and the Veteran's contentions as to his symptoms, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current generalized headaches arose in or are related to his active service or service-connected disabilities.

Taking the medical evidence into account in light of the benefit of the doubt rule, the Board finds that further development is not necessary in this case. See generally Mariano v. Principi, 17?Vet. App.?305, 312 (2003) (it is not permissible to undertake additional development for the purpose of developing negative evidence, and reasons and bases should be provided to explain the decision to pursue further development when it could be construed as obtaining evidence for that purpose).

Accordingly, resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for headaches is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
