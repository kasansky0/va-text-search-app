FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The first date VA received a formal or informal claim for entitlement to service connection for left and right knee disabilities was November 22, 1988; the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claims in a March 1989 rating decision. The Veteran continued to seek service connection for his knee disabilities through November 2009.

2. On November 10, 2009, VA received an informal claim requesting it reopen and adjudicate the Veteran's knee disability claims; the AOJ awarded service connection for left and right kneed disabilities in a January 2010 rating decision. 

3. The Veteran sought an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for knee disabilities based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE), as well as higher than 10 percent ratings for the knees during the period from February 2010 to July 2011; the AOJ addressed those matters in a December 2011 rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal the decision.

4. The first date VA received a formal or informal claim for entitlement to service connection for DM II, and low back disability was February 19, 2010; the AOJ denied the claims in a July 2010 rating decision.

5. On October 31, 2012, the Veteran requested that VA reopen and adjudicate his DM II claim; he also expressed a desire for service connection for a back disability, sciatica, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The AOJ denied the claims in a December 2013 rating decision. 

6. In a November 2014 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran appealed the issues decided in the December 2013 rating decision, to include service connection for a low back disability, total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), and DM II due to service connected knee disabilities with obesity as an intermediate step. Ultimately, the Board denied the appeal in a May 2022 Board Decision. 

7. The first date VA received a formal or informal claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus was February 16, 2016; the AOJ denied the claim in a July 2018 Statement of the Case (SOC). The Veteran did not appeal the SOC. 

8. On June 24, 2022, VA received a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim (supplemental claim) seeking entitlement to a TDIU, and service connection for DM II due to exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune; VA had not adjudicated entitlement to service connection for DM II based on that theory nor had VA received military personnel records confirming he was stationed at Camp Lejeune. 

9. The AOJ did not readjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for DM II in response to the June 24, 2022, supplemental claim; instead, it sent the Veteran a letter explaining that it had not received new and relevant evidence that warranted readjudicating the claim.

10. Since the May 2022 Board decision, new evidence has been received that is relevant to the issue of entitlement to service connection for DM II.

11. The evidence in the claims file that speaks to the period from September 2022 to September 2023 does not raise the inference that the Veteran's left and right knee disabilities worsened during that period. 

12. On August 8, 2023, VA received an intent-to-file a claim, which was followed by a September 11, 2023, supplemental claim requesting readjudication of the issues of entitlement to service connection for DM II, a low back disability, and tinnitus; the AOJ awarded service connection for all those claims in an October 2023 rating decision. The AOJ assigned the disabilities an effective date based on the date it received the Veteran's intent-to-file (August 8, 2023).

13. On September 11, 2023, VA received an increased rating claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) requesting, among other claims, a higher than 10 percent rating for his left and right knee disabilities; the AOJ awarded 40 percent ratings for left and right knee limitation of extension. The AOJ assigned an effective date based on the date it received the Veteran's intent-to-file (August 8, 2023).

14. The Veteran's left knee disability has been manifested by limitation of extension no less than 40 degrees extension across the entire appeal period.

15. The Veteran's left knee disability has been manifested by limitation of extension no less than 35 degrees extension across the entire appeal period.

16. The individual disability ratings for all of the Veteran's disabilities amounted to a 100 percent combined rating on August 8, 2023; the Veteran has been permanently and totally disabled on and after that date.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

There are two decisions issued by the agency of original jurisdiction on appeal. That is, an October 2023 supplemental claim decision, and November 2023 rating decision. The modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies to both decisions.

On June 24, 2022, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim, and requested, amongst other claims, readjudication of entitlement to service connection for DM II most recently addressed in a May 2022 Board decision. The AOJ did not issue a rating decision in response to the claim. The AOJ sent the Veteran a letter expressing that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  

On September 11, 2023, the Veteran again submitted a supplemental claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for DM II, tinnitus, and low back disability most recently addressed in a July 2018 SOC (tinnitus), and May 2022 Board decision (DM II, and low back disability). In October 2023, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and granted service connected for DM II, tinnitus, low back DDD, and left and right lower extremity radiculopathy second to DDD based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. See Rating Decision (awarding an effective date of August 8, 2023, intent-to-file). So, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 decision on appeal.

Moving to the November 2023 rating decision on appeal, it was issued in response to a (September 11, 2023) VA Form 21-526EZ left and right knee disability increased rating claim. It constitutes an initial decision.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. So, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October and November 2023 AOJ decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision(s) on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. New and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim of a service connection for DM II.

2. The assignment of an effective date of June 24, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for DM II. 

The Veteran filed an October 31, 2012, informal claim requesting service connection for DM II, back disability, upper as well as left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities; those claims were ultimately denied in a May 2022 Board Decision. See Rating Decision (awarding service connection for the date of an August 8, 2023, intent to file). The Veteran contends the effective date for the grant of service connection for his claims should be the date of his October 31, 2012, (legacy) informal claim. For the reasons discussed below, the Board concludes the earliest available effective date for DM II is the date of a June 24, 2022, (AMA) supplemental claim. 

The Board would like the Veteran to know there are two appeal systems that were in effect since he filed his October 31, 2012, DM II, and low back disability service connection claims. They are the legacy system and AMA system. In the legacy system, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim is either the date VA received the claim (on appeal) or the date entitlement to the benefit arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

In the AMA, the Veteran has the option not available to legacy claimants of filing a supplemental claim within one year of a Board decision and potentially getting an effective date as early as the date of the filing of the initial claim. Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96, 99 (2024)(holding in the AMA, an issue remains pending and does not become final when a claimant files a supplemental claim within one year of an adverse Board decision). In other words, an effective date reaching back to the initial claim may be preserved if a claim is continuously pursued (also known as "continuous pursuit"). 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). 

VA's legacy appeals system applies to appeals where the initial decision was issued prior to February 19, 2019, unless the appellant opts into the AMA system using one of the methods allowed by law (the Veteran did not do that here). Mattox v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 61, 69 (2021), aff'd, 56 F.4th 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2023). The October 31, 2012, claim the Veteran points to is an initial decision in the legacy system because it was before February 19, 2019. In the legacy system, the issues in an initial decision become final when the Board issues its own decision on the matters appealed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100. This means the Veteran cannot obtain an effective date that reaches back to the date of the initial decision if the Board has denied the appeal. Subsequent claims result in new "initial" decisions. 

The appeal system (legacy or AMA) that applies to the new decision depends on the date it was issued. Calhoun, 37 Vet. App at 99. The AMA system applied to the June 24, 2022, supplemental claim. In the AMA system, VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or obtained. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d). "New evidence" is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. "Relevant evidence" is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1). Relevant evidence also includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed. New and relevant evidence received before VA issues its decision on a supplemental claim will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim. Id. 

A Veteran's appeal for an earlier effective date generally focuses on the procedural history of the claim(s). So, careful attention to the date of filing of the DM II service connection claim is warranted. VA received an informal claim for DM II, low back disability, and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy on October 31, 2012. The AOJ denied the claims in a December 2013 rating decision, which was appealed and ultimately decided in a May 2022 legacy Board decision. The Board denied the claims, to include entitlement to service connection to DM II second to his service connected knee disabilities with obesity as an intermediate step. See Board Decision at 5-6.

VA received a supplemental claim on June 24, 2022, seeking service connection for DM II due to exposure to contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune, and a TDIU. Up to that date, there were few service personnel records associated with the claim that referenced any time spent at Camp Lejeune. Nevertheless, the AOJ informed the Veteran it needed new and relevant evidence to readjudicate his DM II claim and provided him 60 days to do so. See June 29, 2022, Correspondence. The Veteran responded within the 60-days with a statement reiterating that he is seeking service connection based on a new theory of service connection for DM II (exposure to contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune). See July 22, 2022, Statement in Support of Claim. The record suggests the AOJ did not find that sufficient to readjudicate the DM II-claim because it did not issue a rating decision; instead, it closed the appeal sometime in August 2022. See February 2024 Statement at 2 (arguing that he was not informed his June 24, 2022, supplemental claim was closed until March 2023).

The Veteran relates that he did not discover his June 24, 2022,  supplemental claim had been closed until March 2023. Id.at 1-2. He then submitted an August 11, 2023, intent-to-file; it was followed by a September 11, 2023, supplemental claim seeking, among other claims, service connection for DM II, tinnitus, and a back disability. In an October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ awarded service connection for tinnitus, DM II, low back DDD, and left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities. See Rating Decision. All of his disabilities were assigned the same effective date based on the date of his (August 8, 2023) intent-to-file. Id. As noted, he desires an effective date that reaches back to his October 31, 2012, legacy claim. See February 2024 Statement at 1. 

A.	The October 31, 2012, service connection claim had not been opted into the AMA system.

The October 31, 2012, claim remained a legacy claim because the AMA system had not gone into effect until February 19, 2019. While there are methods a Veteran could move a legacy claim to the AMA system, the record does not indicate this Veteran did so here. This means the Veteran could not have "continuously pursued" the August 31, 2012, claim because a Board decision is a final decision on appeals in the legacy system. Any subsequent supplemental claim did not have the effect of continuing the October 31, 2012, informal claim. Pallay v. McDonough, No. 22-6535, 2024 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 401 (Vet. App. Mar. 21, 2024) (mem dec)(Green. W) (explaining that the Veteran's belief that an appeal in the legacy system converts to an AMA appeal by simply filing a new AMA claim is mistaken).

An effective date earlier than June 24, 2022, is not available to this Veteran because the June 24, 2022, supplemental claim could not have resulted in an effective date reaching back to that date of his (October 31, 2012) legacy claim. The Board hopes this alleviates the Veteran's concern that he may have missed the opportunity for an effective date as far back as October 31, 2012, when the AOJ closed his June 24, 2022, supplemental claim. An effective date earlier the June 2022 was not available to this Veteran.

B.	New and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the June 24, 2022, claim for entitlement to service connection for DM II. 

The Board concludes the June 24, 2022, supplemental claim was sufficient to warrant readjudication of the issue of entitlement to service connection for DM II. It included a lay assertion that he might have been exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. This is new evidence because the few service personnel records associated with the claim up to that date did not reference service at Camp Lejeune. His lay statement is relevant because the AOJ had not addressed the likelihood that DM II might be related to his service at Camp Lejeune. VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d).  

Normally the Board would remand such a claim for readjudication. However, that is not necessary in this case because the AOJ already awarded service connection for DM II. See October 2023 Rating Decision at 4. The most the Board can do for the Veteran is decide the date of his DM II claim should have been June 24, 2022, rather than August 8, 2023; that results in the assignment of an effective date of June 24, 2022. The Board cannot award an earlier effective date because the date can be no earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim (here, June 24, 2022) if it is filed more than one year after notice of a rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

C.	The assignment of an effective date of June 24, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for DM II.

The Board has determined the Veteran could not have continuously pursued the October 31, 2012, informal claim because that claim was adjudicated under the legacy system. Mattox, 34 Vet. App. at 69 (VA's legacy appeals system applies for appeals where the initial decision was issued prior to February 19, 2019, unless the appellant opts into the AMA using one of the methods allowed by law). This means the earliest available effective date for the grant of service connection for DM II is the date of his more recent (June 24, 2022) DM II claim. Accordingly, the Board concludes service connection for DM II is warranted from June 24, 2022, but no earlier. 

The Board can determine the impact this decision has on the Veteran's combined disability rating because the AOJ has already assigned a (20 percent) disability rating. See October 2023 Rating Decision. The Board notes that the Veteran has not disagreed with the assigned rating. The grant of a 20 percent rating from June 24, 2022, for DM II results in a 90 percent combined rating from June 24, 2022. A breakdown of the disabilities that result in that combined disability rating can be found in the discussion about DEA benefits below.

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 8, 2023, for the award of service connection for low back DDD, as well as left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities.  

The AOJ awarded service connection for low back DDD, as well as right and left lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities in an October 2023 rating decision; all the disabilities were awarded an effective date of August 8, 2023. It is the date VA received an intent-to-file. The Veteran contends the effective date for the grant of service connection for low back DDD, and radiculopathy disabilities should be the date of his October 31, 2012, legacy claim. For the reasons discussed below, the Board concludes the earliest available effective date for the above listed disabilities is August 8, 2023. 

Unless there is some exception (and there is not one here), the effective date can be no earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim if it is filed more than one year after notice of rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

Beginning with the procedural history of the above listed claims, VA received an informal claim for DM II, low back disability, and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities on October 31, 2012. The AOJ denied the claims in a December 2013 rating decision, which was appealed and ultimately decided in a May 2022 Board decision. See November 2014 NOD. The Board denied the back disability and lower extremity radiculopathy disability claims. See May 2022 Board Decision at 9-10. 

The June 24, 2022, supplemental claim discussed above did not raise the inference that the Veteran wanted his low back disability, and lower radiculopathy disability claims readjudicated at that time as there was no mention of a back disability in the (June 24, 2022) supplemental claim. See Supplemental Claim (listing the issues of TDIU, and DM II due to exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune). On August 8, 2023, VA received an intent-to-file that was followed by a September 11, 2023, supplemental claim. This claim listed, among other issues, service connection for a back disability. See Supplemental Claim (listing the issues of entitlement to service connection for DM II, tinnitus, bilateral hearing loss disability, and back disability). The AOJ expanded the back disability claim to include left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities second to DDD. The AOJ awarded service connection for the three disabilities (low back DDD as well as left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities) in the October 2023 rating decision on appeal; all the disabilities were assigned the effective date of his (August 8, 2023) intent-to-file. See Rating Decision.

A.	The entitlement claims raised in the October 31, 2012, legacy claim was denied in a May 2022 Board decision; that decision is final.

Turning to the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date, the Board sees no basis to conclude that the low back disability and lower extremity radiculopathy disability claims were capable of being continuously pursued after the unfavorable May 2022 Board decision. In the legacy system, that is a final determination on the matters. Calhoun, 37 Vet. App at 101 (explaining that a Board decision is final in the legacy system unless the Veteran appeals the Board decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC)). By that date (May 2022), the AMA had come into effect; so, the earliest effective date would have to be the date VA received a supplemental claim. It could not be any supplemental claim, but one that resulted in readjudication of the back and lower extremity radiculopathy disability claims. Mattox, 34 Vet. App. at 69 (VA's AMA system applies for appeals where the initial decision was issued after February 19, 2019). The June 24, 2022, supplemental claim was not such a claim.

The June 24, 2022, supplemental claim did not result in the adjudication of a back disability service connection claim. This is because it did not raise such a claim. As noted, it indicated the Veteran wanted to have his DM II service connection claim and TDIU claim readjudicated. This means the Board does not view the June 24, 2022, supplemental claim as the claim that led the AOJ to readjudicate and award service connection for his back disability as well as lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities. The first post-May 2022 supplemental claim mentioning service connection for back disability received by VA is the September 11, 2023, supplemental claim. 

B.	The AOJ properly awarded an August 8, 2023, effective date for the low back DDD, as well as left and right lower extremity disabilities.

The AOJ determined the Veteran initiated his back and lower radiculopathy disability claims on August 8, 2023-which is the date VA received his intent-to-file. See October 2023 Rating Decision at 3. The Board would like the Veteran to know the term "date of receipt of the claim" has a special meaning under VA regulations. If VA receives a claim, to include a supplemental claim, within one year of receipt of the intent-to-file, the claim is considered filed as of the date of receipt of the intent-to-file. Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7. F.4th 1110, 1147-48  (Fed. Cir. July 2021)(holding that if a supplemental claim is received within one year of an intent to file, the date the intent to file was received is the date of claim for effective date purposes). All this is to say that the AOJ properly determined August 8, 2023, is the earliest available effective date. The Board sees no basis to conclude otherwise. Accordingly, the Veteran's appeals for an effective date before August 8, 2023, for the award of service connection for low back DDD and left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities are denied. 

4. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 8, 2023, for the award of service connection for tinnitus. 

The AOJ denied the Veteran's initial (February 2016) tinnitus service connection claim in a July 2018 SOC; he did not express a desire to reopen or readjudicate the claim until VA received his September 11, 2023, supplemental claim. For reasons not explained, the Veteran contends his tinnitus claim should be assigned an October 31, 2012, effective date. See March 2024 NOD. The Board concludes the AOJ properly awarded an August 8, 2023, effective date. See October 2023 Rating Decision at 5.

Unless there is some exception (and there is not one here), the effective date can be no earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim if it is filed more than one year after notice of rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

Beginning with the procedural history of the tinnitus service connection claim, VA received the initial claim in February 2016, which was denied in a May 2016 rating decision. He appealed the AOJ's decision, which resulted in a July 2018 SOC that again denied service connection for tinnitus. See July 2016 NOD. He did not appeal the SOC nor submit another claim seeking service connection for tinnitus until September 11, 2023. 

On August 8, 2023, VA received an intent-to-file that was followed by a September 11, 2023, supplemental claim. This claim listed, among other issues, service connection for tinnitus. See Supplemental Claim (listing the issues of entitlement to service connection for DM II, tinnitus, bilateral hearing loss disability, and back disability). The AOJ awarded service connection for tinnitus in the October 2023 rating decision on appeal; the AOJ assigned the effective date based on the date VA received the Veteran's (August 8, 2023) intent-to-file. See Rating Decision at 5; October 2023 Rating Decision at 3.

Turning to the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date, the Board sees no reason to conclude the June 24, 2022, supplemental claim resulted in the AOJ's determination to readjudicate his tinnitus claim. This is because it did not raise that claim. As noted, it indicated the Veteran wanted to have his DM II service connection claim and TDIU claim readjudicated. The first supplemental claim that mentioned tinnitus is the one received by VA on September 11, 2023. Mattox, 34 Vet. App. at 69 (VA's AMA system applies to appeals where the initial decision was issued after February 19, 2019).

The AOJ properly determined the Veteran initiated his tinnitus service connection claim when it received his August 8, 2023, intent-to-file. This is because it was followed by the September 11, 2023, supplemental claim. Military-Veterans Advocacy, 7. F.4th at 1147-48. Accordingly, the Veteran's appeal for an effective date before August 8, 2023, for the award of service connection for tinnitus is denied. 

5. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 8, 2023, for the award of an increased rating of 40 percent for left and right knee disabilities. 

The Veteran's left and right knee chondromalacia patella (limitation of extension) disabilities have been service connected since May 25, 2009; they have been rated 10 percent up to August 8, 2023. The AOJ awarded increased disability ratings of 40 percent on and after that date. See November 2023 Rating Decision at 2 ("The increased evaluation has been established from the day VA received your intent to file (ITF) a claim for compensation.") For reasons not explained, the Veteran contends the 40 percent ratings should be effective from October 31, 2012. See March 2024 NOD. 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (rating schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Disability ratings are intended to compensate impairment in earning capacity due to a service-connected disorder. 38 U.S.C. § 1155.

The schedular criteria for musculoskeletal disabilities contemplate factors such as pain, weakened movement and interference with standing and walking. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995) (examiners must contemplate additional functional loss due to weakness, fatigability, incoordination, or painful motion); Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26, 34-36 (2017) (examiner must attempt to elicit information regarding the severity, frequency, duration, and functional loss during flare-ups).

Although pain may cause functional loss, pain itself does not constitute functional loss. Pain must affect some aspect of "the normal working movements of the body," such as "excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance," in order to constitute functional loss. Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 36-39 (2011) (holding that pain alone does not constitute functional loss and is just one fact to be considered when evaluating functional impairment).

The Veteran's left and right knee disabilities are rated under DC 5261. Under 5261, compensation is based on the degree of limitation of extension. Diagnostic code 5261 provides that when extension is limited to 5 degrees, a noncompensable (0 percent) disability rating is warranted. When it is limited to 10 degrees, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted. When limitation is at 15 degrees, a 20 percent disability rating is warranted. When it is limited to 20 degrees, a 30 percent disability rating is warranted. When it is limited to 30 degrees warrants a 40 percent disability rating is warranted. And when it is limited to 45 degrees, a 50 percent disability rating is warranted. A 50 percent disability rating is the maximum schedular rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Beginning with a brief history of the Veteran's left and right knee chondromalacia patella (limitation of extension) disabilities, they stem from in-service physical training. He twisted his knees while running on the beach. See October 2023 VA Knee and Lower Leg Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) at 3. He was awarded service connection for the knees in a January 2010 rating decision; the AOJ assigned a 10 percent rating under DC 5261 from May 25, 2009. See Rating Decision at 2. By that date, he observed weakness, stiffness, swelling, giving way, locking, deformity, tenderness, and lack of endurance resulting in difficulties with standing and walking. See Private Examination at 1. His symptoms resulted in the ability to bend the knee (flexion) to 140 degrees. There was no interference with the ability to straighten the knee (extension). Id. at 2. None of the symptoms met the criteria 5261 requires for a compensable rating, so the AOJ awarded 10 percent ratings based on painful motion. See January 2010 Rating Decision at 2.

The Veteran has already pursued an earlier effective date reaching back to October 1, 1988 (day following separation from service). See April 2010 Appellate Brief (arguing that the denial of his initial (November 22, 1988) knee service connection claim was clear and unmistakable error). In a July 2011 rating decision, the AOJ declined to award an effective date before May 25, 2009. The Veteran did not appeal that decision. But he did again pursue an increased disability rating, which was denied in a December 2011 rating decision; he did not appeal the decision nor submit new and material evidence within a year of the rating decision. 

The record reflects the Veteran did not pursue an increased rating for left/right knee (limitation of extension) disabilities until September 11, 2023. For reasons that are not clear to the Board, he asserts that he sought such a claim in the October 31, 2012, informal (legacy) claim discussed above. See October 31, 2012, correspondence (expressly stating the Veteran is requesting service connection for DM II second to knee disabilities, back disability, sciatica, sleep apnea); February 2024 Statement at 1 (asserting his left and right knee disability increased rating claims were part of his October 31, 2012, claim). 

By September 11, 2023, the Veteran had been observing constant numbness at his feet resulting in the need to regularly use a wheelchair, or walker. See October 2023 VA Knee and Lower Leg Disability DBQ at 3. With regards to range of motion limitations, he could bend the left knee (flexion) to 110 degrees, and straighten the knee (extension) to 40 degrees. For the right knee, flexion was 100 degrees, and extension was 35 degrees. Diagnostic code 5261 contemplates the inability to straighten the knees less than 30 degrees as 40 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261.It is also the rating the AOJ assigned for both knees in the November 2023 rating decision on appeal. See Rating Decision at 2. The AOJ assigned the effective date of the August 8, 2023, intent-to-file. Id. 

A.	Whether the Veteran was seeking an effective date any time before October 31, 2012.

To start, the Board does not interpret the Veteran's earlier effective date claim to be one that requests an effective date that goes as far back as the day following his separation service. See April 2010 Appellate Brief (arguing that the denial of his initial (November 22, 1988) knee service connection claim was clear and unmistakable error). First, the AOJ has adjudicated such a claim, and the Veteran did not disagree with that determination; so, it became final. See July 2011 Rating Decision. Second, the Veteran has not expressly requested an effective date the reaches back to his initial claim. He did not do so; instead, he asserted that he believes the assigned increased (40 percent ) ratings for his knee disabilities should be effective from October 31, 2012. See February 2024 Statement at 1 (asserting his left and right knee disability increased rating claims were part of his October 31, 2012, claim); March 2024 NOD (asserting the effective date for his knee disability claims should be October 31, 2012). So, the Board sees no reason(s)-or basis in the record-to adjudicate the merits of a claim for an effective date before October 31, 2012. 

B.	The entitlement claims raised through the October 31, 2012, informal claim did not include left and right knee disability increased rating claims.

The Board does not see a basis to find the October 31, 2012, legacy claim expressed a desire for the AOJ to adjudicate whether higher than 10 percent ratings for his knee disabilities are warranted. His representative provided a cover letter that expressly listed four issues, to include service connection for DM II, a back disability, sciatica, and OSA. The subsequent December 2013 rating decision resolves any doubt the AOJ might have expanded the claims to include increased ratings for the knees as it does not list such claims in the decision. See Rating Decision (adjudicating the issues of special monthly compensation, a TDIU, as well as service connection for PTSD, back disability, right hip disability, OSA, and DM II). There is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor on this matter. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (2021) (holding the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal," and does not require that the evidence be in exact equipoise). 

Because the Board has determined the October 31, 2012, legacy claim did not raise a left or right knee increased rating claim, the effective date of any increased rating cannot be earlier than the date of claim, unless the evidence shows the disability increased in severity during the one-year period before his claim. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 983-84 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (holding an effective date can be earlier than the date of the claim for an increase if the increase in disability occurred during the one-year period before the date of the claim).

C.	The AOJ properly determined the Veteran initiated his left and right knee disability claims on August 8, 2023. 

To start, the Board sees no reason to conclude the June 24, 2022, supplemental claim requested increased disability ratings for left and right knee disabilities. First, the (June 24, 2022) supplemental claim indicated the Veteran wanted to have his DM II service connection claim and TDIU claim readjudicated. Second, the AOJ had not issued a rating decision addressing entitlement to increased disability ratings for his knees since December 2011. The first knee disability increased rating claim received by VA since December 2011 is the September 11, 2023, supplemental claim. 

The AOJ properly determined the Veteran initiated his knee disability increased rating claims when it received his August 8, 2023, intent-to-file. This is because it was followed by the September 11, 2023, supplemental claim. Military-Veterans Advocacy, 7. F.4th at 1147-48 (holding that if a supplemental claim is received within one year of an intent to file, the date the intent to file was received is the date of claim for effective date purposes). The Board sees no basis to conclude otherwise; so, the Veteran's earlier effective date claims for the award of 40 percent ratings for his knee disabilities are denied.

The Board considered whether the Veteran was requesting a 40 percent rating during the one-year period before his supplemental claim. But the evidence does not support finding his left or right knee disability worsened during the one-year look back period. He had not asserted such worsening occurred during that period, and the medical evidence relating to the period does not support finding his knee disabilities progressed to the current level of severity on any particular date between September 2022 and September 2023. So, the Board finds an effective date during the one-year look back period is not warranted. Gaston, 605 F.3d at 983-84 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007) (staged ratings are appropriate when the factual findings show distinct periods where the service- connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings). 

For the reasons discussed above, the Board sees no basis to find VA received a left or right knee disability increased rating claim between December 2011 and August 8, 2023. Further, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding either disability worsened during the one-year look back period (August 2022 to August 2023). So, the earliest effective date for the award of a 40 percent rating for his left and right knee limitation of extension disabilities is August 8, 2023.

6. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 8, 2023, for the award of basic eligibility to DEA benefits under Chapter 35. 

Entitlement to DEA benefits is warranted when a Veteran is a permanently and totally disability due to service-connected disabilities, as well as in other circumstances that are not relevant to this appeal. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a)(2). VA considers a Veteran is permanently and totally disabled when he has a combined 100 percent rating. 

The point in time that the Veteran became permanently and totally disabled determines when he should have been awarded basic eligibility for DEA benefits. So, special attention to the date the Veteran's combined rating went from 90 to 100 percent is warranted. The Veteran had a combined 90 percent rating from June 24, 2022, to include (in order from highest to lowest disability rating) PTSD (70 percent from October 31, 2012); OSA (50 percent from October 31, 2012); left knee disability limitation of extension (10 percent rating from May 25, 2009); right knee disability limitation of extension (10 percent from May 25, 2009); DM II (20 percent from June 24, 2022); right knee instability (10 percent from July 19, 2011); left knee instability (10 percent from July 19, 2011). 

The Veteran's service connected disabilities resulted in a combined 100 percent rating on and after August 8, 2023. The disabilities include (in order from highest to lowest disability rating) PTSD (70 percent from October 31, 2012); OSA (50 percent from October 31, 2012); left knee disability limitation of extension (40 percent rating from August 8, 2023); right knee disability limitation of extension (40 percent from August 8, 2023); DM II (20 percent from June 24, 2022); low back DDD (20 percent from August 8, 2023); left lower extremity radiculopathy (20 percent from August 8, 2023); right lower extremity radiculopathy (20 percent from August 8, 2023); right knee instability (10 percent from July 19, 2011); left knee instability (10 percent from July 19, 2011); and tinnitus (10 percent from August 8, 2023). 

Turning to the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for basic eligibility for DEA benefits, the AOJ determined that he is permanently and totally disabled from August 8, 2023. That is the date his disabilities resulted in a combined 100 percent rating. See October 2023 Rating Decision at 5. The Board has run its own calculations to determine if the disabilities resulted in a combined 100 percent on any date before August 8, 2023; they do not. So, there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781 (holding that the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply unless the evidence is in "approximate balance"). The Board concludes the AOJ properly determined that the Veteran is 

?

entitled to basic eligibility for DEA benefits on and after August 8, 2023; so, his earlier effective date claim must be denied.
