Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 23, 2023, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy, was granted by the Regional Office (RO) in a June 2023 rating decision, and assigned an effective date of March 23, 2023 in a November 2023 rating decision, based on the date entitlement arose.

1. Service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, was granted by the Regional Office (RO) in a June 2023 rating decision, and assigned an effective date of March 23, 2023 in a November 2023 rating decision, based on the date entitlement arose.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than March 23, 2023, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than March 23, 2023, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2007 to June 2007 and from February 2009 to February 2010. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting a separate rating for his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy disability, which had not been addressed in any prior rating decision. In June 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental claim decision granting service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral strain disability effective May 30, 2023. 

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested an earlier effective date of January 27, 2021. In the November 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which granted an earlier effective date of March 23, 2023. 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Date Claims

The Veteran seeks entitlement to earlier effective dates, prior to March 23, 2023, for the grants of entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies. Specifically, the Veteran, through his attorney, asserts that the Veteran's radiculopathy claims should be considered as part and parcel of his low back disorder, and that separate ratings should be awarded from the date of grant of entitlement to service connection for the low back disorder, which was granted in a September 2022 rating decision, effective January 24, 2022. See e.g., Third Party Correspondence, November 23, 2022; see also Rating Decision, September 20, 2022. 

According to applicable law and regulation, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based upon an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The date of entitlement to an award of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

The effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on a reopened claim is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2), (r). Thus, once a previous decision has become final, the earliest effective date of service connection generally is the date of the petition to reopen rather than the date of the initial claim. Exceptions to this rule include a later grant of service connection based in whole or in part on newly obtained service department records under certain circumstances, as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), and when the decision is revised or reversed on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), as provided in 38 U.S.C. § 5109A(a) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).

A "claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). Any communication indicating an intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). An informal claim must identify the benefits sought; and upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of the receipt of the informal claim. Id. 

However, if, at any time after the VA issues a decision on a claim, the VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when the VA first decided the claim, the VA will reconsider the claim, notwithstanding the subsection addressing reopening claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3). Service department records that are relevant to the claimed in-service event, injury, or disease, are such § 3.156(c) records. However, to qualify as such records, the award of benefits must be based at least in part on the records. Additionally, this does not apply to records that the VA could not have obtained when it decided the claim because the records did not exist when the VA decided the claim, or because the claimant failed to provide sufficient information for the VA to identify and obtain the records.

Significantly, if the claim is granted based on such service department records, the award is to be effective on the date entitlement arose or the date the VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later, or such other date as may be authorized by the provisions of this part applicable to the previously decided claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3).

Although a claimant need not identify the benefit sought "with specificity," see Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 199-200 (1992), some intent on the part of the Veteran to seek benefits must be demonstrated. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998); see also Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-7 (1995) (noting that while VA must interpret a claimant's submissions broadly, VA is not required to conjure up issues not raised by claimant). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has emphasized VA has a duty to develop a Veteran's claim fully and sympathetically to its optimum. Hodge v. West, 155 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1998). This duty requires VA to "determine all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations," Roberson v. West, 251 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and extends to giving a sympathetic reading to all pro se pleadings of record. Szemraj v. Principi, 357 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The mere presence of medical evidence does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for a disability. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998). The effective date of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but rather, on the date the application was filed with VA. Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999).

When all the evidence is assembled, the Secretary is then responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

By way of background, the Veteran filed a claim for entitlement to low back pain that was received by VA in March 2011, that was denied by the RO in an August 2012 rating decision. Thereafter, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim and requested readjudication of his low back disorder previously denied in an August 2012 rating decision. See VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, January 17, 2021. The claim for entitlement to service connection for a low back condition was again denied in an April 2021 rating decision. The Veteran was notified of these decisions and did not appeal the decisions within the one-year appeal time period; thus, the decisions became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103.

In August 2021, the Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review as to the April 2021 rating decision. In a September 2021 rating decision, a duty to assist error was identified and the Veteran's low back pain was sent to an additional VA examination. Thereafter, in a January 2022 rating decision, the claim for entitlement to service connection for a low back condition was again denied as the evidence did not show a currently diagnosed disability. 

The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim application as to the January 2022 rating decision in January 2022. See VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, January 24, 2022. In an April 2022 rating decision, the AOJ denied readjudication of the claim because the evidence submitted was not new and relevant. The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim application as to the April 2022 rating decision in May 2022. See VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, May 4, 2022. Thereafter, in a September 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral strain, claimed as a low back condition, with a 20 percent disability rating, effective January 24, 2022. 

Following the grant of entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder in the September 2022 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a November 2022 Higher Level Review as to separate ratings for his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies and for an earlier effective date as to the grant of entitlement to service connection for the lumbosacral strain. In a February 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted an effective date of January 27, 2021, based on continuous pursuit of his claim. 

Thereafter, the Veteran submitted a March 2023 Supplemental Claim Application as to the March 2023 rating decision, disagreeing with the separate ratings for the bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies and seeking a higher rating for the lumbosacral strain. 

In a June 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted separate ratings for the bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies, with 10 percent ratings each, both effective May 30, 2023, the dates the radiculopathies were first diagnosed. See Rating Decision, June 9, 2023. The Veteran submitted the Higher Level Review request as to the June 2023 rating decision in July 2023; the November 2023 rating decision assigned effective dates of March 23, 2023, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for the bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies. This appeal follows. Those basic facts are not in dispute.

Turning to the medical evidence, at the April 2021 VA back examination, while the Veteran stated "sometimes pain goes down both legs, started in 2009," the VA examiner noted the Veteran as not having radiculopathy. 

At the November 2021 VA back examination, while the Veteran stated having "radiating pain and numbness affecting both legs," the VA examiner noted the Veteran did not have radiculopathy. 

In a February 2022 VA examination for the back, the Veteran denied having radiculopathy symptoms. The VA examiner did not diagnose radiculopathy. 

In the September 2022 VA back examination, the VA examiner noted the Veteran as not having radiculopathy. 

In March 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim requesting an increased rating for his lumbosacral strain disability and separate ratings for radiculopathy. Along with the supplemental claim, the Veteran submitted an undated letter from his chiropractor, Dr. C.S., stating the Veteran has radiculopathy. 

During a May 2023 VA back examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that effective dates earlier than March 23, 2023, for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy are not warranted. In this regard, the Veteran's medical treatment records prior to March 23, 2023, are void of a diagnosis for radiculopathy. In the April 2021 and November 2021 VA back examinations, the examiners did not diagnose the Veteran with radiculopathy. In May 2022, the Veteran submitted his chiropractic records from Dr. B.W. which are silent for a radiculopathy diagnosis. In the September 2022 VA back examination, the examiner did not diagnose the Veteran with radiculopathy. In March 2023, the Veteran submitted an undated letter from his chiropractor, Dr. C.S., which states the Veteran "continues to have periodic flare-ups of pain including muscle spasm, decreased mobility, and lower extremity radiculopathy as a result of these injuries" but does not provide a diagnosis for radiculopathy prior to March 23, 2023. 

The Board notes that there is an indication from the record that the Veteran may have had bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies before he filed his claim for service connection for such. Nevertheless, the effective date of an award of service connection is assigned not based on the date the disability appeared or the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating the existence of such disability and a causal connection to service or a service-connected disability; rather, the effective date is assigned based on consideration of the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was received by VA. See Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382-383. 

Importantly, the pertinent regulations specifically state that the effective date should be the date of a claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. In the instant case, based on these regulations, the effective dates have been appropriately assigned as the date of the first diagnosis related to bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies shown in the medical evidence. While sympathetic to the Veteran's general belief that earlier effective dates are warranted, for the reasons outlined above, the Board is precluded by law from assigning an effective dates prior to March 23, 2023, for the grants of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy and left lower extremity radiculopathy.

While the Veteran is competent to describe symptoms of radiculopathy prior to March 23, 2023, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis as diagnosis of radiculopathy requires medical expertise. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran because the record does not show that he has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

Finally, the Board acknowledges the arguments of the Veteran and his attorney that entitlement to earlier effective dates for the grants of entitlement to service connection for his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies is warranted based on the grant of entitlement to service connection for his lumbosacral strain. Here, however, the Board notes the weight of the medical evidence demonstrated that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity symptoms did not rise to warrant diagnoses related to bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy until first seen in the medical evidence on March 23, 2023. Notably, the various VA examiners noted the reported symptoms but did not diagnose radiculopathy until a May 2023 VA examination. In addition, the Veteran denied symptoms related to radiculopathy or radiating symptoms at his February 2022 VA examination for the back. As entitlement to the grant of service connection for left lower extremity and right lower extremity radiculopathy was not warranted until date entitlement arose, which is later than the date of claim in this instant case, this argument is without merit. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than March 23, 2023 for the grants of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy and right lower extremity radiculopathy is not warranted. The appeal is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.
