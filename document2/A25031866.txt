DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypertension is granted.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected hypertension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Service connection for hypertension is warranted effective October 27, 2021.  

2. During the appeal period, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of October 27, 2021, for the award of service connection for hypertension have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

2. The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1970 to October 1971, including service in the Republic of Vietnam.  As a result of his military service, the Veteran receive the Combat Infantryman Badge, among other decorations. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypertension

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of service-connected compensation is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  However, in a claim for increased compensation, the effective date may date back as much as one year before the date of the application for increase if it is factually "ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred" within that one year.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for certain diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents, even though there is no record of such disease during service, if they manifest to a compensable degree any time after service, in a veteran who had active military, naval, air, or space service, during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, in the Republic of Vietnam, including the waters offshore, and other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in Vietnam.  38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(e), 3.313.  This presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C. § 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  The diseases that are deemed associated with herbicide agent exposure under VA law are listed in 38 U.S.C. § 1116 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

 

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, was enacted on August 10, 2022.  See PACT Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168 § 3373, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022).  Section 403 of the PACT Act expands the presumption of in-service herbicide agent exposure to additional territories and countries.  Id. at § 403 (codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. § 1116). 

Notwithstanding the foregoing presumption provisions for herbicide exposure, a claimant is not precluded from establishing service connection with proof of direct causation.  38 U.S.C. § 1113(b); Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1994). 

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, was enacted on August 10, 2022.  Section 404 of the PACT Act added hypertension to the list of diseases which are presumptively related to exposure to herbicide agents. 

The Veteran was awarded service connection for hypertension on a presumptive basis effective August 10, 2022, pursuant to the PACT Act.

However, the Veteran claimed that he is entitled to an earlier effective date back to October 2021, the date of his claim.  Service connection can be established prior to the enactment of the PACT ACT based on a finding of direct service connection.

In November 2022, the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion.  The examiner stated that "the latest Veterans and Agent Orange Update (2018) has moved HTN from the limited or suggestive evidence of association to the sufficient evidence of association.  This means that four years ago there was unequivocal evidence that exposure to herbicides causes hypertension."  As such, the examiner opined that it is more likely than not that the Veteran's exposure to herbicides caused his hypertension.  See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility, November 2022.

The Board finds the Veteran's hypertension was caused by his exposure to herbicide agents and, therefore, the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of October 27, 2021, the date of his claim. 

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected hypertension

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his hypertension.

Hypertension is rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension).  Under DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria.  Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common."  See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

In rating hypertension under DC 7101, the Board may consider blood pressure readings taken while a veteran is using medication.  McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) (holding that DC 7101 contemplates the effects of medication and therefore Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012) does not apply).

For the reasons that follow, the Veteran's hypertension has manifested in requiring continuous medication for control, corresponding to the criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 7101.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in March 2023.  He was not found to suffer from Diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.  His blood pressure readings at the examination were as follows: 167/96, 150/88, and 147/85 and he required daily medication.   See C&P Exam, March 2023.

Accordingly, during the appeal period, the Veteran's hypertension has manifested in the requirement of continuous medication for control, corresponding to the criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 7101.

?

A higher 20 percent rating under DC 7101 is not warranted unless diastolic pressure is predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure is predominantly 200 or more.  None of the Veteran's blood pressure readings present with diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.  Accordingly, the Veteran's hypertension does not more nearly approximate the criteria corresponding to a 20 percent rating.  A higher 20 percent rating is not warranted.
