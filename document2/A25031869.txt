ORDER

The appeal seeking revision or reversal of an April 2006 rating decision that denied higher and separate compensable evaluations for a right knee disability, based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE), is denied.

The appeal seeking revision or reversal of a July 2019 rating decision that denied higher and separate compensable evaluations for a right knee disability, based on CUE, is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claim for entitlement to a higher evaluations for a right knee disability was denied in an April 2006 rating decision that became final because he did not submit a notice of disagreement or new and material evidence within the appeal period. 

2. The correct facts, as known at the time, were before the VA adjudicators in April 2006.

3. The July 2019 rating decision that denied entitlement to a separate compensable evaluation for arthritis of the right knee is subsumed by the April 2020 Board decision.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to revision of an April 2006 rating decision that denied a higher evaluation for a right knee disability based on a separate compensable evaluation for arthritis, on the basis of CUE pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105, have not been satisfied. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a).

2. The claim of CUE in the subsumed July 2019 rating decision regarding service connection for a separate compensable evaluation for arthritis of the right knee is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from June 1988 to June 1991.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2022 ; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In May 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2022 decision. In September 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2022 decision. 

In the January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

New evidence cannot be considered in deciding motions seeking revision or reversal of prior final decisions based on CUE, as such CUE motions must be based upon the facts and law that existed at the time of the prior decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a)(1)(iii).

1. Entitlement to revision or reversal of an April 2006 rating decision that denied higher and separate compensable evaluations for a right knee disability, based on CUE.

2. Entitlement to revision or reversal of a July 2019 rating decision that denied higher and separate compensable evaluations for a right knee disability, based on CUE.

In April 2022 the Veteran, through his representative, alleged that the April 2006 and July 2019 rating decisions that, in part, denied entitlement to higher evaluations for right knee disabilities contained CUE.

A previous RO determination that is final and binding will be accepted as correct in the absence of CUE. Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of CUE. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105.

CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error." It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE. Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error." Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993). In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different. Id. at 44.

Where evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a). For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision. Id. 

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated"; and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time that decision was rendered. Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992).

RO decisions that are appealed to the Board become subsumed by the Board decision issued in that case. See Brown v. West, 203 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000). 38 C.F.R. § 20.1104. RO decisions that are not directly appealed to the Board may be subsumed by a later Board decision that addresses the same issue and the same factual basis, which is commonly referred to as delayed subsuming. Manning v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 534, 541 (2002) ("[A] later BVA decision's delayed subsuming of an RO decision occurs only where the Board decided the same issue that the RO decided and where the RO decision and BVA review were based on the same factual basis").

In Dittrich v. West, 163 F.3d 1349, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) found that a 1960 RO decision had been subsumed by the Board's later 1969 decision (called "delayed subsuming"), and that the later Board decision was based upon essentially the same evidentiary record, although "some new and material evidence had been acquired in the interim." Dittrich, at 1353; see also VAOGCPREC 14-95 (May 12, 1995).

The Veteran was denied entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for a right knee disability in an April 2006 rating decision. He was notified of this decision in May 2006. The Veteran did not appeal this decision or submit new evidence within one year; therefore, it became final.

The Veteran was again denied entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for a right knee disability in a July 2019 rating decision. The Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board of Appeals in an August 2019 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (VA Form 10182).

Thereafter, in April 2020, the Board denied entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for right knee partial lateral meniscectomy for tear of the lateral meniscus and patellar pan syndrome and granted entitlement to a separate 20 percent evaluation for residuals of meniscal tear of the right knee under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5258. In its decision the Board contemplated the Veteran's loss of range of motion as well as the Veteran's knee pain. The Veteran did not appeal this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) and it became final. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100.

The evaluation was implemented in an April 2020 rating decision. 

The Board finds that the denial of a separate compensable evaluation for a right knee disability based upon arthritis in an April 2006 rating decision is not the product of CUE.

In the April 2006 rating decision, the RO considered the Veteran's service treatment records as well as examination reports. These reports showed a tear of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus on the right side and left lateral tibial cartilage grade 2 to 3. The RO declined to award a separate compensable evaluation for arthritis of the right knee. 

At the time of the April 2006 rating decision, disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where functional loss is alleged due to pain upon motion, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45 must be considered. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995). 

At the time of the April 2006 rating decision, separate ratings were available for limitation of flexion and limitation of extension under Diagnostic Codes 5260 and 5261. VAOPGCPREC 9-2004 (2004).

However, the April 2006 rating decision predates the holding of Burton, which found that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 establish that the Veteran is entitled to at least the minimum compensable evaluation for motion that is accompanied by pain. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011). The rating decision further predates the holding of Lyles, which found that a rating under Diagnostic Code 5260 or 5261 does not preclude, as a matter of law, a separate evaluation under Diagnostic Code 5258 or 5259. Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107, 115 (2017). 

At the time of the April 2006 rating decision, the evaluation of the same disability under various diagnostic codes was to be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. The "critical element" in determining whether separate entities may be assigned for manifestations of the same injury is whether there is overlapping or duplication of symptomatology between or among the disorders. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261 (1994); Brady v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 203, 206 (1993) (the rationale for the prohibition on pyramiding is that "the rating schedule may not be employed as a vehicle for compensating a claimant twice (or more) for the same symptomatology; such a result would overcompensate the claimant for the actual impairment" suffered). Thereafter, it was further noted that pain should be treated as a single manifestation of disability, even if it arises in different circumstances. Estevez v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 157 (2023).

The Board notes that a new interpretation of the law does not apply retroactively to cases finally decided. See George v. McDonough, 596 U.S. 740 (2022). Furthermore, "a first judicial interpretation of the statute could not be the basis for finding CUE where the regulation in existence at the time of the original decision imposed a different rule that VA adjudicators were bound to follow." Perciavalle v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 11, 35 (2021).

In Perciavalle it was noted that the Rule Against Pyramiding, a general policy in rating disabilities, has been present since 1964, and Section 4.14 begins: "The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses is to be avoided," and ends: "[T]he evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses [is] to be avoided." Id. at 28. CAVC found that reading 4.14 and 4.25 (notably section (b) was amended in 1989) were complementary provisions instructing VA to rate only distinct manifestations separately. See Fanning v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 225, 230 (1993). "Of course, it is possible for a veteran to have separate and distinct manifestations attributable to two different disability ratings, and, in such a case, the veteran should be compensated under different diagnoses." Id. The anti-pyramiding rule means "that the rating schedule may not be employed as a vehicle for compensating a claimant twice (or more) for the same symptomatology [because] such a result would overcompensate the claimant for the actual impairment of his [or her] earning capacity." Brady v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 203, 206 (1993).

The Board finds that that the determination in the April 2006 rating decision regarding the evaluation assigned, pursuant to instability, involved a weighing of the facts and the law at the time. The Board finds that it is not clearly and unmistakable erroneous for the AOJ to have determined that Diagnostic Code 5257 regarding instability contemplated knee pain. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257 (2006) (Knee, other impairment of). The law surrounding the assignment of separate compensable evaluations for knee disabilities was in transition during the period and a weighing of the facts was required for the AOJ to properly evaluate the knee without pyramiding. Thus, the Board finds that it was not clearly and unmistakably erroneous for the AOJ to have determined that Veteran's right knee disability manifested by instability and pain were most properly evaluated pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5257 regarding instability.

As the Veteran's arguments are essentially disagreements as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated by the adjudicator. However, "[i]t is the prerogative of the factfinder... to interpret the evidence and draw reasonable inferences from it." Evans, 27 Vet. App. at 187 (citing Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 52 (1990)). A disagreement as to how the facts were weighed does not support a finding of CUE. Fugo, 6 Vet. App. at 43-44. Therefore, revision or reversal of the April 2006 rating decision based on CUE is denied. 

The Board finds that the denial of entitlement to a separate compensable evaluation for a right knee disability based upon arthritis in July 2019 is subsumed by the following April 2020 Board decision. 

In the July 2019 rating decision, the RO considered the Veteran's treatment records and the report of a January 2019 examination. The examiner identified partial lateral meniscectomy for tear of the right lateral meniscus with partial thickness chondromalacia lateral tibial plateau, patellar pain syndrome. The examiner identified the Veteran as being diagnosed with right knee arthritis. The RO declined to award a separate compensable evaluation for arthritis of the right knee. 

As noted above, the Veteran's July 2019 rating decision was subsequently appealed and the decision regarding the evaluation of his right knee disability was finally adjudicated by the Board in April 2020. Therein, the Board declined to award a separate compensable evaluation for arthritis of the right knee. Rather, the Board granted an additional disability evaluation pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5258, which contemplates range of motion. Therefore, the July 2019 rating decision was subsumed by the April 2020 Board decision and the Veteran is legally precluded from claiming CUE in the July 2019 rating decision.
