ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for right ankle disability is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record does not reflect a diagnosis of tinnitus during the period on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1980 to January 1983.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in June 2023 (right ankle) and March 2024 (hearing loss and tinnitus) and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the June 2023 rating decision.  In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 initial rating decision.  In his July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 and March 2024 rating decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Certain chronic diseases, including tinnitus, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus which he contends is due to exposure from acoustic trauma during his active miliary service.

Upon review of the relevant evidence, the Board determines that service connection for tinnitus is not warranted.  During the March 2024 VA examination, the Veteran denied experiencing any tinnitus symptoms.  As the Veteran denied experiencing any tinnitus symptomatology, the examiner determined the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of tinnitus.  Moreover, post-service VA treatment records are also silent for complaints of tinnitus symptoms.  Notably, in October 2019, during the only post-service VA audiological evaluation in the record, the Veteran specifically denied experiencing tinnitus symptoms.  Here, there simply is no indication in the record that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus.

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Giplin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  The requirement that a current disability be present is satisfied "when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim...even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim."  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); see also Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  Here the medical evidence does not show the presence of a current disability, nor does the evidence establish any physical functional impairment that would suggest such a disability even in the absence of a diagnosis.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, No. 17-1466 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

As the claims file does not show a diagnoses of tinnitus following separation from service, the Veteran's claim for service connection for tinnitus is denied.  In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not nearly in balance, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.  While the Veteran underwent a VA examination in March 2024, prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, this examination is inadequate.

It appears that the Veteran had some difficulty with following instructions during the March 2024 VA examination.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's puretone threshold averages and speech reception thresholds are not in agreement and, therefore, the results from the examination are not valid for rating purposes.  While puretone thresholds are not recorded in the examination report, the examiner noted that the Veteran's speech discrimination under the Maryland CNC was 94 percent in both the right and left ears and that there is a high probability for hazardous noise exposure during service due to the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) as a Short Range Missile Crewman.  Additionally, while post-service VA treatment records from October 2019 audiological testing reflect speech discrimination scores of 92 percent in both the right and left ears, which suggest a disability of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, the examiner did not discuss this in the VA examination report. 

Despite the examiner's statement that the attempted testing during the March 2024 VA examination yielded invalid results, the AOJ did not request either a new examination or a medical opinion based on the October 2019 VA treatment records.  Instead, it denied the Veteran's claim based solely on the March 2024 VA examination report with invalid test results.  When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  For this reason, the matter is remanded for a new examination.

2. Entitlement to service connection for right ankle disability is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the June 2023 rating decision on appeal.  While the AOJ obtained a May 2023 medical opinion prior to the June 2023 rating decision on appeal, this medical opinion does not provide an adequate rationale regarding whether the Veteran's right ankle disability had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

The March 2023 VA examiner provided a negative nexus opinion as to direct service connection, stating that the Veteran's service treatment records are silent for right ankle treatment.  However, review of the Veteran's service treatment records reflect that he received treatment for reported right ankle pain and trauma in December 1982, right before separation from service in January 1983.  Here, the 2023 VA examiner did not address this finding in the Veteran's service treatment records.  When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  For this reason, the matter is remanded for an addendum medical opinion with adequate rationale as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right ankle disability. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of any diagnosed hearing loss disability made during the period on appeal.  The examiner should review the claims file.  A complete history from the Veteran should be obtained and recorded.  All testing deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed and the results reported in detail.  A well-reasoned rationale should be given to support any opinion.

Following the review of the claims file and examination of the Veteran, the examiner is then requested to respond to the following:

Is it approximately at least as likely as not (an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) that any diagnosed hearing loss disability made during the period on appeal had its onset in service or is otherwise directly related to service?

In rendering the requested opinions, the examiner should consider and discuss: (1) the Veteran's MOS as a Short Range Missile Crewman; and (2) post-service VA treatment records from October 2019 which reflect audiological testing that shows speech discrimination of 92 percent in the Veteran's right and left ears.

2. Send the Veteran's claims file to an appropriate medical professional to obtain an addendum opinion regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right ankle disability.  The Veteran's electronic claims file must be made accessible to the designated professional for review.  A well-reasoned rationale for any opinion expressed should be provided.  

Following the review of the claims file, the medical opinion provider is then requested to respond to the following: 

Is it approximately at least as likely as not (an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) that the Veteran's right ankle disability had its onset in service or is otherwise directly related to service?

In rendering the requested opinion, the medical opinion provider should consider and discuss the Veteran's service treatment records, which reflect reports of and treatment for right ankle pain and trauma in December 1982, shortly before separation from service in January 1983.  

If the requested opinion cannot be provided without a new examination, one should be scheduled.
