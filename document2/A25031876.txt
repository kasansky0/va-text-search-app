DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of July 12, 2017, for a separate rating of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to special monthly compensation based on housebound criteria (SMC) earlier than February 26, 2020, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. VA received the Veteran's PTSD with TBI intent to file a claim on July 12, 2017, and in June 2018, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim for PTSD, which was service connected as PTSD with TBI.

2. On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), following a December 2023 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision, the parties agreed that the March 2020 rating decision on appeal was initiated by the intent to file a claim received by VA on July 12, 2017.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of July 12, 2017, for a separate rating for TBI have been met.  38 U.S.C. §5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. §3.400(o)(2).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army from March 2007 to July 2007 and from April 2008 to December 2011.

The matters on appeal arise before the Board from a March 2020 rating decision.  

The Veteran filed a February 5, 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD). The Veteran elected the hearing lane, selecting a Veterans Appeals Improvement Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA) hearing with a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). 

However, in July 2022, the Veteran withdrew his request for a hearing. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §20.302(b), if the Veteran commences an AMA appeal and initially selects the hearing lane but withdraws his hearing request before the hearing is held, the Board will adjudicate the claim based on a review of the evidence that was of record at the time of the underlying decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), as well as the evidence submitted within 90 days following receipt of the request for withdrawal. In December 2023, the Board issued a decision denying (1) entitlement to an effective date prior to February 26, 2019, for a separate rating of TBI, (2) entitlement to SMC based on housebound criteria earlier than February 26, 2020, and (3) entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to February 26, 2020, for DEA.  The Board granted entitlement to an earlier effective date of February 26, 2019, for a separate rating of TBI.   

The Veteran appeal to the Court.  In an October 2024 Order, pursuant to an October 2024 Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR), the Court vacated the portion of the December 2023 Board decision that denied entitlement to an effective date prior to February 26, 2019 for a separate rating of TBI, and remanded the claim, along with the intertwined claims for earlier effective dates for SMC and DEA, back to the Board for further development.  The Board's grant of an earlier effective date of February 26, 2019, for a separate rating of TBI was not disturbed on appeal.  

The matter is back before the Board.  

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of July 12, 2017, for a separate rating of TBI is granted.

As an initial matter, in terms of procedural history, in this case, the parties agreed in the October 2024 JMPR that the Veteran filed an intent to file a claim on July 12, 2017, and in June 2018, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim for PTSD, which was service connected as "PTSD with TBI."  The parties further agreed that the AOJ denied an increased rating for PTSD with TBI in an August 2018 decision and that the Veteran filed a NOD in July 2019.  They stated that the March 2020 rating decision awarding a separate rating for TBI found that it was in response to the NOD.  Thus, the parties agreed that the March 2020 rating decision on appeal was initiated by the intent to file a claim received by VA on July 12, 2017.

Turning to the merits of the claim, the effective date of a rating and award for pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

As noted, the parties agreed that the Veteran's intent to file an increased rating claim for the PTSD and TBI was received by VA on July 12, 2017.  A June 17, 2016, VA Review PTSD DBQ shows the Veteran has a TBI diagnosis and that it was possible to differentiate what symptoms are attributable to TBI as opposed to the PTSD.  Further, a May 2014 VA Initial Evaluation of Residuals of TBI DBQ states that the Veteran has a TBI diagnosis and "may have social, subjective and neurobehavioral abnormalities but they are due to PTSD not to TBI."

Considering the lay and medical evidence of an onset of distinguishable TBI symptoms as early as May 2014, which is more than a year prior to July 12, 2017, the Board has resolved reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, in finding that an effective date of July 12, 2017, but no earlier for the award of a separate rating for the TBI is warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (If the increase occurred more than a year prior to the claim, the effective date shall be the date of the claim.) 

For these reasons, the Board concludes that an earlier effective date of July 12, 2017, for a separate rating of TBI is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to SMC earlier than February 26, 2020, is remanded.

2. Entitlement for an earlier effective date prior to February 26, 2020, for DEA is remanded.

The issues of entitlement to a grant of SMC and DEA earlier than February 26, 2020, are inextricably intertwined with the grant of benefits awarded in this decision.  Thus, those matters are remanded so they can be addressed with the implementation of this decision.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991) (holding that two issues are "inextricably intertwined" when they are so closely tied together that the final decision on one issue cannot be rendered until a decision on the other issues has been rendered).  The Board also notes that the Veteran has a separate appeal pending on the issue of his entitlement to a disability rating higher than 70% for posttraumatic stress disorder for the period prior to February 26, 2020.  Resolution of that separate appeal may also impact the Veteran's entitlement to an earlier effective date.  Id. That appeal, which is pending under the Legacy appeals system under a separate Board docket will be issued in a separate decision by the Board.    

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Following the implementation of the Board's decision granting an earlier effective date of July 12, 2017, for a separate rating of TBI, adjudicate the issues of the Veteran's entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 26, 2020, for SMC and DEA benefits.
