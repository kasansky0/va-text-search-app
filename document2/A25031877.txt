DOCKET NO. 241211-493045
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

An initial compensable percent rating for hypothyroidism is denied.

A separate 10 percent rating for a lack of energy associated with hypothyroidism is granted.

A separate 10 percent rating for muscle cramps associated with hypothyroidism is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hypothyroidism is manifested by a lack of energy and muscle cramps when not treated with medication.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial compensable percent rating for hypothyroidism have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.7, 4.119, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7903.

2. The criteria for a 10 separate percent rating for a lack of energy associated with hypothyroidism have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.7, 4.88(b), DC 6354.

3. The criteria for a separate 10 percent rating for muscle cramps associated with hypothyroidism have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.7, 4.71(a), DC 5025.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Marine Corps from January 1966 to January 1968 and was awarded the Purple Heart.

An initial rating decision was issued in February 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the prior decision.  In July 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 decision.

In his December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), held that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).   In this case, the Veteran explicitly waived any alternative Board review options in January 2025.  Therefore, the Board will proceed with a decision.

Initial rating for hypothyroidism

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity and individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's hypothyroidism is rated as noncompensable under 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, DC 7903.  That code provides that a 100 percent disability rating be assigned for hypothyroidism manifesting as myxedema (cold intolerance, muscular weakness, cardiovascular involvement (including, but not limited to hypotension, bradycardia, and pericardial effusion), and mental disturbance (including, but not limited to dementia, slowing of thought and depression)), but only for a period of six months after an examiner has determined that the condition has stabilized. Thereafter, the residual effects of hypothyroidism are to be rated under the appropriate DCs within the appropriate body system(s) (e.g., eye, digestive, and mental disorders). 

Note 2 to Diagnostic Code 7903 provides that hypothyroidism without myxedema warrants a 30 percent rating for six months beyond the date an examining clinician has determined crises stabilization. Thereafter, residuals of the disease, to include eye conditions, or medical treatment, are rated under the most appropriate Diagnostic Code(s) under the appropriate body system (e.g., eye, digestive, mental disorders).

Private treatment records show the Veteran's hypothyroidism had been stabilized since 2018, before the period on appeal.  Therefore, the 30 percent and 100 percent ratings above are not applicable.  Rather, the disability must be rated on its residuals.

In that regard, during a March 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he lacked energy and experienced muscle cramps when he did not take his thyroid medication.  The record shows that he has treated his hypothyroidism with levothyroxine for many years.  The rating criteria of DC 7903 do not consider the use of medication and therefore the Board cannot consider the ameliorative effects of using levothyroxine in assigning a rating.  Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).

As the Veteran reported lacking energy, the Board has considered a rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.88(b), DC 6354, for chronic fatigue syndrome.  Unlike DC 7903, DC 6354 specifically contemplates the use of medication.  Specifically, a 10 percent rating is assigned when symptoms are controlled by medication.  Since the Veteran's lack of energy associated with hypothyroidism is not present with daily levothyroxine, a 10 percent rating under DC 6354 is appropriate.   A higher 20 percent rating for symptoms which interfere with routine daily activities is not warranted because, per the Veteran's statements, he is asymptomatic when using medication.

The Veteran also reported having generalized muscle cramps, so the Board has considered a rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5025, for fibromyalgia.  That DC also contemplates the use of medication.  A 10 percent rating is assigned when the condition requires continuous medication for control.  Since the Veteran's muscle cramps associated with hypothyroidism are not present with daily levothyroxine, a 10 percent rating under DC 5025 is appropriate.  A higher 20 percent rating for episode musculoskeletal pain is not warranted because, per the Veteran's statements, he is asymptomatic when using medication.

Aside from the lack of energy and muscle cramps reported by the Veteran, there is no evidence of any other symptoms associated with the Veteran's hypothyroidism.  The March 2023 and February 2024 VA examinations identified no symptoms or physical findings associated with hypothyroidism.  The Veteran's outpatient treatment records are similarly negative for any symptoms or impairment associated with the condition.  Therefore, a higher rating under DC 7903, or additional separate ratings under other DCs, are not warranted.
