ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating higher than 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date of March 28, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy is granted. 

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for surgical scars associated with spinal fusion of the lumbar spine is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 29, 2023, for the award of service connection for surgical scars associated with spinal fusion of the lumbar spine is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy has not manifested with symptoms that are worse than mild.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disorder was denied in a final rating decision in April 2017.  

3. The next correspondence from the Veteran indicating a desire to claim service connection for a lumbar spine disorder and right lower extremity radiculopathy was received on March 28, 2022.  The Veteran was informed later that month that he needed to submit a claim on the proper form.  In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim requesting service connection for lumbar spine degenerative disease.

4. There is no correspondence from the Veteran indicating a formal or informal claim for service connection for a lumbar spine or lumbar radiculopathy disorder after April 2017 and prior to March 28, 2022. 

5. The Veteran underwent a right transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion surgery on March 29, 2023, which resulted in two surgical scars.

6. The Veteran has two surgical scars from his lumbar spine surgery which are both 4 centimeters (cm.) by 0.1 cm., and they are not painful or unstable.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1989 to April 1993.

This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  The Veteran submitted a request for Higher-Level Review in July 2023, and a Higher-Level Review decision was issued in November 2023.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to Higher-Level Review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the June 2023 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the Veteran's attorney included references to a potential claim of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability in his July and November 2023 briefs.  A claim of entitlement to TDIU can be part of an increased rating claim, when raised during the open appeal period.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  In this case, however, there is no indication in the evidence, or any assertion from the Veteran, that his right lower extremity radiculopathy or surgical scars have impacted his ability to work.  The attorney briefs also encompass issues that are part of separate appeal streams, and in July 2023, the Veteran submitted a Higher-Level Review request which included entitlement to a TDIU, and it was addressed in a separate, unappealed September 2024 rating decision.  The Board finds that this issue is not currently encompassed by the appeal now being adjudicated.

Right Lower Extremity Radiculopathy 

The Veteran has requested an initial rating higher than 10 percent for his right lower extremity radiculopathy.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.? Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.? 38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §?4.1.? Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation.? Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.7.???? 

The Veteran's lower extremity radiculopathy is rated under Diagnostic Code 8520, for paralysis of the sciatic nerve.? Incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve is assigned a 10 percent rating when it is mild, a 20 percent rating when it is moderate, and a 40 percent rating when it is moderately severe.? A 60 percent rating is assigned when it is severe, with marked muscular atrophy.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.????? 

Words such as "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" are not defined in the Rating Schedule.? The regulations do state that when the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating for incomplete paralysis should be for the mild, or, at most, the moderate degree.? Id.? The Board finds that "mild" symptoms in this context is defined as having subjective symptoms only, or subjective symptoms with diminished sensation, which do not significantly impact range of motion or the ability to use the upper leg, lower leg, or foot.??????? 

"Moderate" symptoms will be defined here as indicating a higher level of impairment, including an absence of sensation, or near absence in at least some parts of the leg, confirmed by objective findings; subjective symptoms which result in significant loss of function of the leg or foot; or clinically observable symptoms which affect sensation, strength, and range of motion.??????? 

"Severe" symptoms are defined here as symptoms which are clinically measurable and nearly constant, and which cause great impairment in the use of the leg, including impairment in the ability to walk, plus diminished sensation, diminished reflexes, and reduced muscle strength.  The reduction in muscle strength must be great enough to produce clinically measurable muscle atrophy. 

"Moderately severe" symptoms, which must therefore fall somewhere between "moderate" and "severe" symptoms, will be defined as being most of the symptoms which are required to be "severe," but not meeting all of these requirements, such as not showing one of the following: diminished sensation, diminished reflexes, and reduced muscle strength.??Muscle atrophy is not necessarily present.  There must still be great impairment in the ability to use the legs for mobility. 

The Veteran attended a VA examination in May 2023.  He reported that he had undergone back surgery in March 2023, and was going through the healing process.  He reported that he had improvement in his pain since the surgery.  He was diagnosed with radiculopathy of the lumbar region.  He had full strength in his right leg and no muscle atrophy.  Reflexes were normal.  Sensory examination was normal.  The Veteran could not perform straight leg raising tests because he was under restrictions from his surgery.  The examiner found that the Veteran had radiculopathy symptoms of mild intermittent pain, mild paresthesias/dysesthesias, and mild numbness affecting the right sciatic nerve.  He used a brace and cane to help with ambulation.

The Board finds that this VA examination is fully adequate for the purposes of evaluating this condition.  The examination was conducted by  a competent nurse practitioner, and she provided all necessary findings.  There is no indication that this practitioner was not qualified or competent, and no indication of any inaccuracies occurring within the examination.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's attorney wrote that he was unable to look up the VA examiner in the Office of Disability and Medical Assessment Clinician Lookup database.  The Board recognizes that this may have been inconvenient, but does not find that this diminishes the probative value of the examination.  The Veteran's attorney did not actually challenge the examiner's qualifications or identify any error that may have occurred in the examination.  See Francway v. Wilkie, 940 F.3d 1304, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 2019).

The Veteran's private treatment records show that in March, April, and May 2022, the Veteran reported having constant, sharp low back pain that radiated into his right buttock, thigh, and calf, with paresthesias.  He reported that standing for long periods of time exacerbated his symptoms.  He used a cane to ambulate and reported having weakness and gait disturbance in his lower extremities.  He had full range of motion in the hips, knees, and ankles, without tenderness on palpation.  There are no relevant VA treatment records within the appeal period.

After reviewing all of the evidence of record within the current appeal period and evidence window, the Board finds that the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy has been no worse than mild, and a higher initial rating is not warranted.  

The May 2023 VA examination found that all of the Veteran's symptoms were mild.  There were no clinically observable symptoms of radiculopathy, as the sensory testing, strength testing, and reflex testing was all normal.  The Veteran therefore had subjective symptoms only, and there was no indication that he had decreased ability to use his right leg other than his own reports of weakness with long periods of standing.  The findings at the examination were consistent with his private treatment records.  They showed pain and weakness with prolonged standing, but did not indicate that any clinically observable impairment had been found due to radiculopathy.  The Board finds that these symptoms fall squarely into the criteria for "mild" radiculopathy.  See 38?C.F.R. §?4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.????? 

There is no medical evidence showing that the Veteran was ever found to have an absence of sensation, or near absence in at least some parts of the leg, which was confirmed by objective findings.  There is no evidence in any of the treatment records or the examination that there have been clinically observable symptoms which affect sensation, strength, and range of motion.  While the Veteran does use a brace and cane to help him ambulate, he is still fully able to walk independently, and has now shown any major impairment in the use of his leg or basic ability to walk.  There is also no evidence, or assertion from the Veteran, that his subjective symptoms have resulted in significant loss of function of the leg or foot.??The Veteran also has not alleged that he takes medication to treat his radiculopathy or that medication has lessened the measurable impact of his symptoms.  See McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016).   The symptoms therefore have not been at least "moderate," and a higher rating cannot be assigned.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's attorney has argued that the Veteran should be awarded a higher rating because the July 2023 VA examination found that the Veteran had moderate constant pain in his right leg.  However, this medical evaluation was held after the June 2023 rating decision was issued, and it is not part of the current evidence window which can be considered.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  The limitations of the evidence window were clearly explained to the Veteran and his attorney in the November 2023 Higher-Level Review decision.  They then specifically chose the "Direct Review" option in the July 2024 Notice of Disagreement, and they did not submit any additional evidence which might indicate that they wished to change the appeal lane or have additional evidence reviewed.  The Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim to the AOJ in December 2024, and therefore all evidence obtained after June 2023 will be reviewed by the AOJ in its adjudication of this claim.

The Board finds that the weight of the probative evidence does not indicate that the Veteran's symptoms associated with his right lower extremity radiculopathy are worse than "mild."  An initial rating higher than 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy is not warranted.? The evidence is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.? See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (2021).???

The Board also finds that an effective date of March 28, 2022, but no earlier, can be assigned for the award of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy.

Claims for service connection for a lumbar spine/lower back disorder had been previously denied in a May 1993 rating decision and an April 2017 rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal these decisions, and they are final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103. 

On March 28, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, requesting service connection for spinal stenosis and lumbar radiculopathy.  Several days later, the AOJ sent the Veteran a letter informing him that his claims had been previously denied, and he needed to submit the claims on the proper form.  The Veteran then submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim in September 2022, requesting service connection for multiple disabilities, including a lumbar spine disorder.  

Under the revised regulations of the AMA, a veteran who disagrees with a rating decision may submit a Supplemental Claim along with new and relevant evidence.  38?C.F.R. §?3.2501.  The filing date of a Supplemental Claim is determined according to § 3.155, with the exception of the intent to file rule found in § 3.155(b), which applies only to initial claims.  38?C.F.R. §?3.2501(d). 

38?C.F.R. §?3.155(c) states that when a communication indicating a belief in entitlement to benefits that is submitted on a VA paper application form is not complete, VA shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative of the information necessary to complete the application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If a complete claim is submitted within 1 year of receipt of the incomplete application form, VA will consider it as filed as of the date VA received the incomplete application form.  38?C.F.R. §?3.155(c). 

Here, the Veteran did submit the complete application on an appropriate form within one year of his March 2022 claim, and the Board finds that this earlier submission does constitute the start of the claim.  An earlier effective date of March 28, 2022, can be awarded.

There is no evidence indicating that an effective date any earlier than March 28, 2022, can be assigned.  There are no informal or informal claims submitted by the Veteran regarding any disabilities after the April 2017 rating decision, but prior to March 28, 2022.  The Veteran and his attorney also have not asserted that they submitted any claims earlier than March 28, 2022, which are still pending.

The Board therefore finds that an earlier effective date of March 28, 2022, can be assigned, but there is no basis under law that would allow for an effective date any earlier than March 28, 2022.  Entitlement to an effective date of March 28, 2022, but no earlier, is granted. 

Surgical Scars 

The Veteran has also appealed the noncompensable initial rating assigned for his surgical scars associated with spinal fusion of the lumbar spine.

The Veteran attended a VA examination in May 2023.  He had a linear scar from his cervical fusion surgery from June 2022, and two linear scars from his lumbar fusion surgery in March 2023.  None of the scars were painful or unstable.  The lumbar spine scars were both 4 cm. by 0.1 cm.

The Board finds that this VA examination, conducted by a competent nurse practitioner, is fully adequate for the purposes of evaluating this condition.  There is no indication that this practitioner was not qualified or competent, and no indication of any inaccuracies occurring within the examination.  

There is no other medical evidence indicating that the Veteran's scars have ever been larger or more symptomatic than was found at the May 2023 examination.

Scars are rated under various diagnostic codes under 38?C.F.R. §?4.118.  When a veteran has one or two scars that are unstable or painful, a 10 percent rating can be assigned.  38?C.F.R. §?4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7804.  Scars not on the head, face, or neck, which are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage are assigned a 10 percent rating when they affect an area of 144 square inches (929 square cm.) or greater.  38?C.F.R. §?4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7801. 

Any disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-7804 will be evaluated under an appropriate diagnostic code.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.118, Diagnostic Code 7805.? In this case, however, there is no evidence indicating any functional impairment or other disabling effects from the Veteran's scars, and therefore no other diagnostic codes are applicable.? 

In this case, there is absolutely no indication that the Veteran's scars have been painful or unstable, or that they affect at least 929 square cm., and a compensable rating is not warranted.  There is no other contradictory evidence indicating that the Veteran's scars are worse than found at the VA examination, and no other indications that a compensable rating could be assigned under any diagnostic code.? 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's attorney wrote in the November 2023 brief that the Veteran should be assigned a 10 percent rating "due to the veteran alleging the scar is painful."  The Board does not find, however, that the Veteran has ever alleged that either scar is painful at any time during the appeal period and within the current evidence window.  The Veteran did not report to the VA examiner that his scars were painful, nor does he report in his private treatment records that his scars were painful.  He has not submitted any statements indicating that his scars are painful.  It is therefore unclear to the Board what the attorney's basis is for making this assertion, and it is outweighed by the other evidence of record.

The Board finds that the evidence indicates that the Veteran's surgical scars have not meet the criteria for a compensable rating at any time.  At no time have they been found to be painful or unstable, and they affect an area of much less than 929 square cm.  The evidence is not in approximate balance regarding the assignment of any higher rating.? See Lynch, 21 F. 4th 776.?????

Regarding the effective date assigned, the Board finds that there is no basis which would allow for an effective date any earlier than March 29, 2023.

The effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation is generally the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.? 38?U.S.C. §?5110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.400.

Here, the evidence clearly shows that the Veteran had right transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion surgery on March 29, 2023.  It is this surgery that resulted in the two surgical scars which are currently service connected.  This is therefore the date that "entitlement arose," and it is the appropriate date for the award of service connection.  There is no evidence indicating that the Veteran had any other scars associated with his service-connected lumbar spine disability any earlier than this, nor has the Veteran or his attorney provided any argument regarding why an earlier effective date should be awarded.

The Board notes that the Veteran's VA examination also found that the Veteran had a cervical spine scar from his cervical fusion surgery in June 2022.  While this date is earlier than March 2023, this scar is not part of the Veteran's service-connected scars.  The Veteran is not currently service connected for a cervical spine disorder, and therefore the scars associated with this surgery are also not service connected.

The Board finds that the earliest date that it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran had two surgical scars associated with his lumbar spine surgery is March 29, 2023.  This is the date that entitlement arose, and it is the earliest date that a separate award of service connection for surgical scars can be assigned.? The claim for an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for surgical scars associated with spinal fusion of the lumbar spine is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
