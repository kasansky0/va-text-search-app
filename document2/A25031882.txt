ORDER

The appeal seeking eligibility for attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a November 2023 rating decision is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

During the pendency of this appeal, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved attorney fees in the amount of $1,961.22, an amount equal to 20 percent of $9,806.11, which is the amount of past-due benefits awarded as a result of the November 2023 rating decision.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal seeking eligibility for attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a November 2023 rating decision has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In December 2023, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, from the appellant, seeking review of a November 2023 Fee Decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).  Specifically, the appellant contended that he was entitled to attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded as a result of a November 2023 rating decision which increased the Veteran's combined rating from 90 percent to 100 percent through an adjusted calculation of the bilateral factor.  Notably, the November 2023 Fee Decision identified the past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran as a result of such rating decision as $9,806.11, and the amount withheld for attorney fees as $1,961.22, though ultimately finding that the payment of attorney fees was not warranted.

However, the record indicates that, while this appeal was pending, the appellant was issued a direct payment of such attorney fees.  Specifically, the record reflects that, in January 2024, the AOJ directed that the fee identified in the November 2023 Fee Decision, $1,961.22, be disbursed, with $1,863.16 to the appellant and an assessment fee of $98.06 to appropriations.  See January 2024 Attorney Fee Memorandum.  The record also reflects that such payment to the appellant was made on January 23, 2024.  See January 2024 VA Fiscal Transaction.

In short, the January 2024 Attorney Fee Memorandum and subsequent payment to appellant constitutes an implicit revision of the November 2023 Fee Decision and a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal.  As the benefit sought on appeal was granted, there remains no case or controversy, or dispute of fact or law, regarding the issue.
