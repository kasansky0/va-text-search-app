Entitlement to an effective date of November 14, 2019, but no earlier, for the award of entitlement to basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is granted, subject to governing laws and regulations concerning the payment of monetary benefits.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether, during the period from November 14, 2019, the Veteran was precluded from securing and following all substantially gainful employment for which his education and occupational experience would have otherwise qualified him due to his service-connected disabilities.

2. From November 14, 2019, the Veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total and additional service-connected disabilities ratable at 60 percent or more.

3. As the Veteran has been awarded a TDIU since November 14, 2019, an effective date of November 14, 2019, for the award of eligibility for DEA benefits is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of November 14, 2019, but no earlier, for the grant of a TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.104, 3.156, 3.400, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

2. The criteria for an effective date of November 14, 2019, but no earlier, for the grant of SMC(s)(1) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114 (s), 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.350(i), 3.400.

3. The criteria for an effective date of November 14, 2019, but no earlier, for entitlement to basic eligibility to DEA have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3510, 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400, 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2001 to May 2005.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In response to the April 2024 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a timely VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) in May 2024. The Veteran requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Accordingly, the Board will consider the evidence considered by the April 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

1. Entitlement to an effective date of November 14, 2019, but no earlier, for the award of entitlement to for a TDIU

In a March 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to a TDIU, effective October 16, 2021. Entitlement to SMC based upon housebound criteria and DEA benefits were granted, effective October 16, 2021. 

The Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim in July 2022 seeking earlier effective dates for the benefits awarded. The Veteran's claims were denied in an August 2022 rating decision. The Veteran requested higher level review of this determination, which resulted in the April 2024 rating decision on appeal. 

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The award of a TDIU is an award of increased disability compensation for purposes of assigning an effective date. Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007); Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 367, 369 (1991).

The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date, otherwise, date of receipt of claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) and VA's General Counsel have interpreted the laws and regulations pertaining to the effective date for an increase as follows: If the increase occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the award is effective the date of claim. If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1),(2).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400 (a), the modernized review system is applicable to all claims, requests for reopening finally decided claims for which VA issues notice of a decision on or after the effective date of the modernized review system. The modernized review system became effective on February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2 (a). Because the VA issued notice of the April 2024 rating decision after February 19, 2019, the regulations regarding continuous pursuit of a claim as set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c) apply.

The effective date for a continuously pursued claim shall be the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if the claimant continuously pursed the issue by timely filing any of the available review options set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

In May 2020, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his service-connected PTSD. In response to this claim, the AOJ issued a rating decision in May 2020 continuing the Veteran's 70 percent rating for PTSD. In December 2020, the Veteran filed another claim for an increased rating for his service-connected PTSD. In January 2021, the Veteran's 70 percent rating for PTSD was continued again by the AOJ. The Veteran requested higher level review of this determination and the Veteran's 70 percent rating for PTSD was continued again in an April 2021 HLR decision. In July 2021, the Veteran filed another claim for an increased rating for his service-connected PTSD. In September 2021, the Veteran's 70 percent rating for PTSD was continued. The Veteran again requested higher level review of this determination and the Veteran's 70 percent rating for PTSD was continued again in a November 2021 HLR decision. 

In November 2021, the Veteran filed a VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability reporting that he became too disabled to work, in part due to his PTSD, on November 14, 2019. This claim resulted in the March 2022 rating decision granting entitlement to TDIU.   

Based upon the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran has continuously pursued a claim for a TDIU as part and parcel of a claim for a higher rating for PTSD since May 2020. Therefore, an earlier effective date is warranted from the date of the Veteran's claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500.

VA will grant a TDIU when the evidence shows that a veteran is precluded, by reason of his service-connected disabilities, from securing and following "substantially gainful employment" consistent with his education and occupational experience. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16; VAOPGCPREC 75-91; 57 Fed. Reg. 2317 (1992).

The central inquiry is, "whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).

The regulations provide that if there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; and if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability must bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident or disabilities affecting a single body system will be considered as one disability for the above purposes of one 60 percent disability or one 40 percent disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

The Board must evaluate whether there are circumstances in the Veteran's case, apart from any non-service-connected condition and advancing age, which would justify a total rating based on individual unemployability due solely to the service- connected conditions. See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993). Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment. Marginal employment generally shall be deemed to exist when a veteran's earned income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person. Marginal employment may also be held to exist, on a facts found basis (including but is not limited to employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop), when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

In Ray v. Wilkie, 31. Vet. App. 58 (2019), the Court defined the term "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" as having two components: one economic and one noneconomic. The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. The non-economic component includes consideration of: the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.

The Board finds that entitlement to TDIU arose on November 14, 2019. Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran's PTSD has been rated 70 percent disabling since July 2, 2018, and that the schedular criteria for TDIU have been met since at least that date. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

The Board finds credible the Veteran's reports in November 2021 that he last had had substantially gainful employment in November 2019. See November 2021 VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. To the extent that the Veteran has worked part-time mowing lawns since November 2019, the Board does not find this work to be substantial or gainful. The Veteran reported earning $14,000 over a 12-month period performing these duties in his November 2021 application for TDIU. The poverty threshold for 2021 for one person under the age 65 was $14,097. See https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html. As the Veteran's income was under the poverty threshold in 2021, his employment in 2021 is not considered substantially gainful employment. Therefore, he meets the economic component of Ray for the entire period since November 2019. 31 Vet. Ap. 58, 73 (2019).

The Board also finds that the Veteran's symptoms due to his PTSD precluded him from securing and following all substantially gainful employment since November 2019. This is supported by the findings of the May 2020 VA psychiatric examiner that the Veteran's PTSD resulted in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood. The examiner stated that the Veteran's condition caused symptoms that would interfere with his ability to maintain substantially gainful employment such as impaired judgment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances such as work or a work like setting. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD could be anticipated to disrupt occupational functioning by causing the Veteran difficulties in interacting with co-workers and supervisors. The Board also finds that the Veteran's impairments in judgment and motivation caused by his psychiatric condition would cause him difficulties with focus, attention, and concentration required for sedentary work. Additionally, the Veteran's low energy and motivation could occasionally cause him to miss work or be off task during expected work hours.

Based upon the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD has caused him to be unable to secure or follow any substantially gainful occupation since November 2019. The evidence, at a minimum, gives rise to a reasonable doubt on the matter; as such, the Board finds that entitlement to a TDIU due solely to PTSD is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

As the Veteran filed for the increased rating for PTSD in May 2020 within one year of the factually ascertainable worsening of the Veteran's condition, the Board finds that entitlement to TDIU is warranted from November 14, 2019, the date he became too disabled to maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected PTSD. As such, an earlier effective date of November 14, 2019, for the award of entitlement to a TDIU is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1),(2).

To the extent that the Veteran would contend that an effective date prior to November 14, 2019, is warranted, the Board notes that the Veteran has submitted statements reporting that he became too disabled to work as of November 14, 2019. See November 2021 VA 21-8940. Additionally, the evidence supports that the Veteran was performing substantially gainful work from May 2019 to November 2019 as a recreation technician for the National Forest Service. See May 2020 VA examination; see also November 2021 VA 21-8940. As the Veteran was performing substantially gainful work during this period, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an effective date prior to November 14, 2019, for entitlement to a TDIU. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 3.400, 3.4.16. 

2. Entitlement to an effective date of November 14, 2019, but no earlier, for the award of entitlement to special monthly compensation

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s), when a Veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total and has additional service-connected disability independently ratable at 60 percent or more, he is entitled to SMC. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s)(1). 

In a March 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to SMC based upon housebound criteria, effective October 16, 2021. The Veteran appealed this determination arguing that an earlier effective date was warranted. 

Herein, the Veteran has been granted an effective date of November 14, 2019, for entitlement to TDIU based upon his service-connected PTSD. The evidence indicates that remainder of the Veteran's service-connected conditions, effective November 14, 2019, have a combined rating in excess of 60 percent. The Veteran therefore meets the criteria for SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s)(1) from November 14, 2019. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114. 

As the Veteran continuously pursued a claim for a TDIU as part and parcel of a claim for a higher rating for PTSD since May 2020 (and filed a claim within one year of worsening of his condition in November 14, 2019), the Board finds that an earlier effective date of November 14, 2019 is warranted for the award of SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s)(1) based on PTSD rated 100 percent disabling, and additional disability or disabilities independently rated as at least 60 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.400.

The evidence of record does not indicate, and the Veteran does not otherwise contend, that he meets the criteria for SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s)(1) prior to November 14, 2019. As the Veteran is not in receipt of a total rating due to a single service-connected disability prior to November 14, 2019, entitlement to an effective date prior to November 14, 2019, for the award of SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s)(1) is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.400.

3. Entitlement to an effective date of November 14, 2019, but no earlier, for the award of entitlement to basic eligibility for DEA benefits

DEA benefits are payable to the child, spouse, or surviving spouse of a veteran if the following conditions are met: (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807 (a).

In the above decision, the Veteran has been awarded a TDIU, from November 14, 2019. Therefore, the Veteran has been adjudicated to have permanent and total disability as of November 14, 2019. Entitlement to eligibility for DEA benefits from November 14, 2019, is therefore warranted.
