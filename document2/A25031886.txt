FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record clearly shows that the Veteran's hypertension first manifested during service and was first diagnosed during service.  

2. The evidence of record shows that the Veteran's ED is at least as likely as not causally related to his service-connected hypertension. 

3. Obesity, in and of itself, is not a disability for VA compensation purposes.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes that is causally related to his active service.  

5. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's lumbosacral strain with IVDS manifested with forward flexion of 30 degrees or less or with ankylosis of the spine.

6. The Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve manifested with moderate incomplete paralysis.

7. The Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve manifested with moderate incomplete paralysis.

8. The Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve manifested with moderate incomplete paralysis.

9. The Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve manifested with moderate incomplete paralysis.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active-duty service from January 1979 to September 1990.

The issues are on appeal under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) from a rating decision issued in August 2023.  The Veteran submitted multiple notices of disagreement in September 2023 electing the direct review lane.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic loss of two toes on the right foot, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

 Evidence of continuity of symptomatology from the time of service until the present is required where the chronicity of a chronic condition manifested during service either has not been established or might reasonably be questioned.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1340 (Fed.Cir.2013) (holding that only conditions listed as chronic diseases in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) may be considered for service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b)).  Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).  

The Board has reviewed all the evidence in the record.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no requirement that the evidence submitted by the appellant or obtained on his behalf be discussed in detail.  Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate each claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to each claim.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) and Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under the laws administered by VA.  VA shall consider all information and medical and lay evidence of record.  Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension.

The Veteran contends that he has hypertension that is causally related to his service. 

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that began during active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

The Board is bound by all favorable findings from the August 2023 rating decision.  As such, the Board notes a current diagnosis of hypertension.  

Service treatment records show multiple findings of elevated blood pressure readings from 1986 forward.  The Veteran was specifically diagnosed with hypertension in July 1986.  

A VA examiner in August 2023 found that the Veteran's claimed hypertension was at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by the Veteran's claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  Specifically, the examiner noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension during active duty and that he continued to have hypertension.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to clearly and overwhelmingly support a finding that the Veteran's hypertension began during active service given the diagnosis during service and the elevated blood pressure findings during service, as well as the VA examiner's opinion that his current hypertension began during service.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for hypertension is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to service connection for ED.

The Veteran contends that his erectile dysfunction is causally related to a service-connected disability. 

The Board is bound by all favorable findings from the August 2023 rating decision.  As such, the Board notes a current diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in August 2023.  The examiner reviewed the Veteran's records and performed a physical examination.  The examiner found that the Veteran's ED is at least as likely as not proximately due to or the result of his service-connected hypertension.  Sexual function knowledge by general practitioners and cardiologists is relevant and should be ideally accessed before starting therapy for hypertension.  In addition to the high prevalence of ED among hypertensive men, its association with the severity of hypertension and the possible interference after the introduction of antihypertensive medications justify the importance of including a brief sexual anamnesis during clinical consultations.  The examiner cited medical literature.  

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current ED is proximately due to or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected hypertension.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for ED is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

3. Entitlement to service connection for obesity.

The Veteran contends that his obesity is a disability that is related to his active service.  The Board notes, however, that obesity is not a disability for VA compensation purposes.  

The Board notes that the finding that obesity is not a disability for VA compensation purposes is a legal finding.  The Court affirmed a Board decision that denied service connection for obesity, to include as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected bilateral knee osteoarthritis, based on a finding that obesity, in and of itself, is not a disability for VA compensation purposes.  Marcelino v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 155 (2018) (holding that the Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the argument that obesity should be considered a disability under the rating schedule).

As obesity is not a disability for VA purposes, service-connection cannot be granted for obesity in its own right.  The Board notes that obesity may be used as an intermediary step for claims of service connection for other disabilities.  

Based on the findings noted above, entitlement to service connection for obesity must be denied as a matter of law.  

4. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran contends that he has bilateral hearing loss that is causally related to his active service. 

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

For the purposes of applying VA laws, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 hertz is 40 decibels (dB) or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when the speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in August 2023.  At the time of the examination, the Veteran's puretone thresholds in dB were as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

Right Ear	40	25	35	35	45

Left Ear	35	35	45	45	50

Speech discrimination scores were 96 percent bilaterally. 

Given the audiological findings, the Veteran has hearing loss for VA purposes.  

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of hearing loss for VA purposes, and the Veteran has submitted lay evidence that he had noise exposure during service, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

The Veteran was afforded an enlistment examination in November 1978.  At the time of the examination, the Veteran's puretone thresholds in dB were as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

Right Ear	20	15	5	5	0

Left Ear	15	5	5	5	0

The Veteran also received an examination after separation from active service for his enlistment in the Army reserves.  At the time of the examination, the Veteran's puretone thresholds in dB were as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

Right Ear	15	10	5	10	10

Left Ear	10	5	10	5	5

On the corresponding report of medical history, the Veteran denied any hearing loss. 

The Veteran was afforded another report of medical examination in May 1996.  At the time of the examination, the Veteran's puretone thresholds in dB were as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

Right Ear	10	15	15	15	20

Left Ear	20	15	20	20	25

On the corresponding report of medical history, the Veteran again denied any hearing loss. 

The August 2023 VA examiner provided a nexus opinion.  He found that the Veteran's hearing loss was not at least as likely as not caused by or a result of an event in military service.  The Veteran's army MOS of Radio Operator had a moderate probability for hazardous noise from 1979 to 1990, but per service treatment records, there is no evidence of a permanent positive threshold shift (worse than reference threshold) greater than normal measurement variability at any frequency between 500 and 6000 Hz for the right or left ear.  The Veteran's hearing loss is less likely than not caused by or a result of an event in military service.  The Veteran's hearing thresholds at enlistment to Reserves, after active-duty separation, reveals no permanent threshold shift as none exceeded 15 dB for high frequencies, which are damaged first from noise exposure.  The Veteran's current hearing loss pattern is not indicative of a noise-induced hearing loss.  

Treatment records show the Veteran was not diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss for decades after separation from service. While the Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of hearing loss since service, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires the interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

Further, the August 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's hearing loss is not at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. The examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the August 2023 medical opinion than the Veteran's lay statements.  Specifically, as the Veteran's current lay statements contradict his more contemporaneous statements provided at separation from service and several years after separation from service.  

Given the evidence cited above, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is causally related to his active service.  As such, entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss must be denied.  

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule of Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  Disabilities must be reviewed in relation to their history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Other applicable, general policy considerations are: interpreting reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability, 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; resolving any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability in favor of the claimant, 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; where there is a questions as to which of two evaluations apply, assigning a higher of the two where the disability pictures more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating, 38 C.F.R. § 4.7; and, evaluating functional impairment on the basis of lack of usefulness, and the effects of the disability upon the person's ordinary activity, 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  

A claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Thus, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The Board notes that it has reviewed all the evidence in the record relevant to the period on review.  This includes VA examinations, VAMC treatment records, and lay statements and argument.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting its decisions, there is no requirement that the Board discuss every piece of evidence in the record.  Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claims.  See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

5. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for lumbosacral strain with IVDS.

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating due to the severity of his low back symptoms.

The Veteran's low back disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5237 for lumbosacral or cervical strain.  Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Id.  at Note 1.  

Ankylosis is defined as "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure."  Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 94 (32nd ed. 2012).  Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.  Id.  at Note 5.  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  The spine has no opposite joint.

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

The Board has considered the ameliorative effects of any medication on the Veteran's orthopedic disability.  The record does not show any treatment for the Veteran's disability.  The Veteran's medication list does not show any prescribed medication, and the VA examination does not indicate any medication used for treatment.  As such, the Board may rate the disability based on the evidence of record.  See Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025). 

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's low back disability.  The Board acknowledges the lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain.  See April 2023 Wife's Statement and August 2023 VA examination. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  See August 2023 VA examination. 

Consideration has also been given to assigning a rating under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  However, the Veteran does not have any documented evidence that the Veteran was ever prescribed bed rest by a physician for a duration that meets the criteria for a higher rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes. 

Regarding neurological impairment, the Veteran has already been granted service connection for radiculopathy, which is addressed in the increased rating analysis below, and the lay and medical evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran has any other neurological abnormality associated with the spine disability.

Based on the foregoing, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 20 percent for lumbosacral strain with IVDS.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v.

6. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve.

7. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve.

8. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve.

9. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve.

The Board will address the issues of entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic and femoral nerve together as they stem from the same legal and factual basis. 

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.  (Neuritis and neuralgia of that group are evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 8620 and 8720.).  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling.  Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a.  

Paralysis of the femoral nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8526.  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 30 disabling.  Complete paralysis, with paralysis of the quadriceps extensor muscles, warrants a 40 percent disability rating.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a.  

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The Board acknowledges the VA Adjudicative Procedures Manual M21-1 (hereinafter M21-1) contains provisions regarding rating peripheral nerve disabilities.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the Board is not bound by the provisions of the M21-1, and the manual does not "carry the force of law."  DAV v. Sec'y of Veterans Affs., 859 F.3d 1072, 1077 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  It is "an internal manual used to convey guidance to VA adjudicators.  It is not intended to establish substantive rules beyond those contained in statute and regulation."  Id.  The M21-1 provisions do not go through the regular rulemaking procedures and is little more than evidence as to how VBA applies law and regulation in practices; it is not binding on the Board as it is not a regulation, instruction of the Secretary, or OGC opinion.  Id.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c).  The regulations further clarify that the Board "is not bound by Department manuals, circulars, or similar administrative issues."  38 C.F.R. § 20.105.  Nevertheless, the Court in Overton v. Wilkie held that the Board is required to discuss "any relevant provisions contained in the [M21] as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases, but because it is not bound by those provisions, it must make its own determination before it chooses to rely on an [M21] provision as a factor to support its decision."  Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018).  More recently, in Wilson v. McDonough, the Court elaborated that, in the context of relevant guidance documents, the Board can "neither merely invoke nor ignore a relevant guidance provision to support its decision but must provide an independent rationale relating its decision to the relevant guidance document."  35 Vet. App. 75, 80 (2021).

Pursuant to Wilson, the Board finds that VA's M21-1 does contain guidance relevant to the adjudication of the issue currently on appeal.  Specifically, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 12, Section A(c) of the M21-1 provides "general guidelines" for the terms "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" in the context of evaluating incomplete paralysis of upper and lower peripheral nerves.  Under the M21-1, "mild" is described as the lowest level of evaluation based on the symptoms, however, slight, as long as they were sufficient to support a diagnosis of the peripheral nerve impairment.  Generally, "mild" is limited to a disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, and affecting a small area and / or a very minimal reflex or motor abnormality.  "Moderate" in the M21-1 is described as the maximum evaluation reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment.  The M21-1 further elaborates that the following "sign / symptom combinations" may fall into the moderate category: combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and / or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate.  

The M21-1 provides "moderately severe" is only applicable for involvement of the sciatic nerve and is described as motor and / or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability is expected.  Atrophy may be present with moderately severe peripheral neuropathy.  "Severe" in general, is expected to include motor and / or reflex impairment (for example atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability.  Trophic changes may be seen with severe longstanding neuropathy.  Even though severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs / symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

The Veteran's left and right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve is rated as mild.  To receive a higher disability rating, the evidence must show moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.  The Board finds that the evidence of record supports the finding of moderate lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral and sciatic nerves bilaterally. 

The Board notes that the August 2023 examiner described the Veteran's constant pain, paresthesias and dysesthesias, and numbness of the lower extremities as moderate.  The Veteran had decreased muscle strength and positive straight leg raising tests that were due to his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  Given the multiple symptoms as well as the description of moderate severity.  The Board finds that a moderate rating is warranted for the right and left femoral and sciatic nerve radiculopathy.  As such a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for the right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve; a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for the left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve; a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for the right lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve; and a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for the left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve.

The Board must then consider whether the Veteran's left or right radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve rises to the level of moderately severe and whether the left or right radiculopathy of the femoral nerve rises to the level of severe.  

The Veteran's August 2023 VA examination and the Veteran's VA treatment records are silent for any trophic changes, any loss of reflexes, any muscle atrophy, or any complete paralysis of the nerves.  The Veteran's pain, numbness, and paresthesias or dysesthesias were described as moderate in the August 2023 examination with no contradictory evidence found in the medical records.  Sensory examination was normal, reflex examination was normal, and the examiner noted no muscle atrophy in August 2023.    

Based on the above, the Board finds that the disability primarily manifested with moderate pain, impairment of motor functions, sensory disturbance, and diminished reflexes.  The Veteran did not have severe or moderately severe symptoms and did not experience trophic changes, loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis of the sciatic or femoral nerves.  The Board thus finds that the level of impairment is most analogous to moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic and femoral nerves bilaterally.

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected.  Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.  

As such, the Board finds that a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for the right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve; a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for the left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve; a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for the right lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve; and a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for the left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve.

10. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for right hand thumb strain.

The Veteran's right hand thumb strain is rated under Diagnostic Code 5228 for limitation of motion of the thumb.  Under that regulation, limitation of motion of the thumb with a gap of less than one inch (2.5 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers warrants a noncompensable disability rating.  Limitation of motion of the thumb with a gap of one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers warrants a 10 percent disability rating.  Limitation of motion of the thumb with a gap of more than two inches (5.1 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers warrants a 20 percent disability rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  

The Board has considered the ameliorative effects of any medication on the Veteran's orthopedic disability.  The record does not show any treatment for the Veteran's disability.  The Veteran's medication list does not show any prescribed medication, and the VA examination does not indicate any medication used for treatment.  As such, the Board may rate the disability based on the evidence of record.  See Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025).

The evidence of record shows that throughout the period on appeal, there is a gap less than one inch between the thumb pad and the fingers with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers.  See August 2023 VA examination. As such, the Veteran is not entitled to a compensable disability rating based on limitation of motion. 

The Board notes, however, that the Veteran is entitled to a compensable disability rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 for limitation of motion.  Under that regulation, with any form of arthritis, painful motion is an important factor of disability, the facial expression, wincing, etc., on pressure or manipulation, should be carefully noted and definitely related to affected joints. Muscle spasm will greatly assist the identification. Sciatic neuritis is not uncommonly caused by arthritis of the spine. The intent of the schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability. It is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. Crepitation either in the soft tissues such as the tendons or ligaments, or crepitation within the joint structures should be noted carefully as points of contact which are diseased. Flexion elicits such manifestations. The joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

In Petitti v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 415, 422-30 (2015), the Court rejected the Secretary's argument that 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, which governs the evaluation of painful motion, requires evidence observed during range of motion testing, and rejecting the Secretary's argument that the mere presence of joint pain is not sufficient.

As the Veteran has stated that he has pain and weakened grip, the Veteran's wife has submitted evidence of the same, and the VA examiner in August 2023 noted pain and decreased grip strength, the Board finds that a compensable 10 percent disability rating is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  10 percent is the minimum compensable disability rating available under Diagnostic Code 5228 for limitation of motion of the thumb.  A higher disability rating is not warranted without actual limitation of motion with a gap between the thumb and the pad, which was not present on examination.  

Based on the evidence cited above, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding of a disability rating for the Veteran's right hand thumb strain as no limitation of motion was found.  As such, the claim must be denied.  

11. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for right hand little finger strain.

12. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for right hand ring finger strain.

The Veteran's right hand little finger and ring finger strain will be addressed together as they stem from the same legal and factual basis.  

The Veteran's little finger and ring finger disabilities are rated under Diagnostic Code 5230 for limitation of motion of the ring or little finger.  Under that regulation, any limitation of motion of the ring or little finger is considered noncompensable.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Under Diagnostic Code 5227, favorable or unfavorable ankylosis of the ring or little finger is also noncompensable.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  

To receive a compensable disability rating for a right or little finger disability, the evidence must show both ring and little finger ankylosis together or amputation of the ring or little finger.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; Diagnostic Codes 5155, 5156, and 5223.

The Board has considered the ameliorative effects of any medication on the Veteran's orthopedic disability.  The record does not show any treatment for the Veteran's disability.  The Veteran's medication list does not show any prescribed medication, and the VA examination does not indicate any medication used for treatment.  As such, the Board may rate the disability based on the evidence of record.  See Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025).

Even considering the Veteran's pain and weakness, the Veteran's disability did not manifest with ankylosis of the fingers and did not manifest to a level where the Veteran would be equally or better served by amputation of the fingers.  See August 2023 VA examination. Additionally, as the rating criteria does not permit a compensable disability rating for limitation of motion of the ring or little fingers, a disability rating may not be assigned under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 based upon pain and weakened movement.  See Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472, 482 (2016) (the Court held that a veteran who experienced "pain" in his fingers but was awarded a non-compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5230 was not entitled to a 10 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. 4.59 because the diagnostic code does not contemplate for such a rating and section 4.59 does not otherwise create a freestanding painful motion disability that is always entitled to a 10 percent rating.)

Based on the evidence cited above, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's little and ring finger disabilities met the criteria for a compensable disability rating.  As such, the issues must be denied.    

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type II is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for chronic loss of two toes on the right foot, to include as secondary to diabetes mellitus type II, is remanded.

The Board will address the issues of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic loss of two toes on the right foot together as they stem from the same legal and factual basis. 

The issues are remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the August 2023 rating decision on appeal.  The AOJ obtained a nexus opinion for each issue in August 2023 prior to the August 2023 rating decision on appeal.  However, these medical opinions do not provide an opinion regarding whether the Veteran's obesity was an intermediate step between his service-connected disabilities and his current claimed disabilities.  

In a 2017 precedential opinion, the General Counsel held that that obesity may qualify as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a current disability where a claimant establishes that the obesity was caused by a service-connected disability and caused his or her current disability.  VA Off. Gen. Counsel. Prec. Op. 1-2017.  Where obesity is asserted to be an intermediate step, the evidence must show that the service-connected disability "caused the veteran to become obese," that the obesity caused by the service-connected disability "was a substantial factor in causing" the current disability, and that the current disability "would not have occurred but for" the obesity caused by the service-connected disability. Id.

VA must obtain new opinions regarding whether the Veteran's obesity is due to his service-connected disabilities, to include whether it is due to his inability to exercise caused by his back disability.  The examiners must then determine whether the Veteran's obesity was a substantial factor in causing the Veteran's sleep apnea or diabetes mellitus type II and whether the Veteran's sleep apnea or diabetes mellitus type II would not have occurred but for the obesity.  

4. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right foot tendinitis is remanded.

The Board notes that a review of the record reveals the Veteran uses medication for his right foot tendinitis.  Specifically, his VA medication list shows that the Veteran was prescribed capsaicin cream to apply to his feet twice a day for pain.  As the applicable diagnostic codes and special musculoskeletal regulations do not reference medication, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects when assigning an evaluation. See Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025).  Here, the medical evidence of record is inadequate to the extent it is unclear whether the ameliorative effects of such medication, if any, were discounted in determining the severity of the Veteran's right foot tendinitis.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012).  As such, a remand is necessary to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a nexus opinion from an appropriate medical examiner.  Following a complete review of the evidence of record and with consideration of the Veteran's lay statements, assuming the statements are credible for the limited purpose of the request herein, the medical professional is requested to provide the following opinions:

(a.) Is the Veteran's obesity due to his service-connected disabilities, to include a claimed inability to exercise caused by his physical disabilities?

(b.) If so, was the Veteran's obesity a substantial factor in causing the Veteran's sleep apnea?

(c.) Would the Veteran's sleep apnea not have occurred but for the Veteran's obesity?

The examiner is informed that a positive opinion indicating a nexus to service or to a service-connected disability does not require certainty.  Rather, if the weight of the evidence is in approximate balance for and against a nexus to service or a service-connected disability, the examiner should decide favorable to the Veteran.

A complete rationale must be provided for all opinions offered.  If an additional examination is required for the examiner to sufficiently address the above questions, then a new examination should be afforded.

2. Obtain a nexus opinion from an appropriate medical examiner.  Following a complete review of the evidence of record and with consideration of the Veteran's lay statements, assuming the statements are credible for the limited purpose of the request herein, the medical professional is requested to provide the following opinions:

(a.) Is the Veteran's obesity due to his service-connected disabilities, to include a claimed inability to exercise caused by his physical disabilities?

(b.) If so, was the Veteran's obesity a substantial factor in causing the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type II?

(c.) Would the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type II not have occurred but for the Veteran's obesity?

The examiner is informed that a positive opinion indicating a nexus to service or to a service-connected disability does not require certainty.  Rather, if the weight of the evidence is in approximate balance for and against a nexus to service or a service-connected disability, the examiner should decide favorable to the Veteran.

A complete rationale must be provided for all opinions offered.  If an additional examination is required for the examiner to sufficiently address the above questions, then a new examination should be afforded.

3. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the severity of the Veteran's right foot tendinitis.  An examination should only be scheduled if the clinician deems one is necessary to provide the requested opinions. 

(a.) The examiner should indicate whether any medications used by the Veteran are productive of ameliorative effects on the service-connected right foot tendinitis. 

(b.) If so, the examiner must identify each medication and clearly explain what the Veteran's symptoms and ranges of motions would be without the medication in all relevant measurements, to include during flare-ups or with repeated use over time.

(c.) In so opining the examiner should consider the lay and medical evidence of record. 

A rationale for all opinions must be provided. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she must explain why an opinion cannot be provided (e.g., lack of sufficient information or evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
