DOCKET NO. 240429-436487
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service-connected coronary artery disease (CAD) renders him unable to secure or maintain substantially gainful employment.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1969 to October 1970.   

This case is being reviewed according to the appellate process set forth under the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA).  This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with a VA decision on their claim to seek review.  This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a February 2024 rating decision of VA.  In his April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket, pursuant to AMA.

The Veteran appeared at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in April 2025.  A transcript of the hearing will be associated with the Veteran's file.  

TDIU Claim

A total disability rating may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, and when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as the result of service-connected disabilities.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  Consideration may be given to a Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

To qualify for a total rating for compensation purposes, the evidence must show: (1) a single disability rated as 100 percent disabling; or (2) that the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disabilities and there is one disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or, if more than one disability, at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and a combined disability rating of 70 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  For the purpose of establishing one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, disabilities affecting a single body system are considered one disability.  Id.  Disabilities that are not service connected cannot serve as a basis for a total disability rating.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.19.

The Veteran is service connected for CAD, rated as 60 percent disabling; for tinnitus, rated as 10 percent disability; for supraventricular arrhythmia, rated as 10 percent disabling; and for hypertension, rated as noncompensable.  The Veteran meets the threshold schedular requirement for consideration for an award of TDIU benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The Veteran submitted a claim for TDIU in September 2022.  The Veteran indicated that his heart condition prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation.  It was noted that the Veteran was last employed, full time, in February 2015.  He noted that he worked as an electrician at a hospital and had been employed there since 1986.   In a subsequent correspondence, the Veteran noted that he worked part time at the hospital until March 2017.

The medical evidence reflects that a January 2018 VA hearing loss and tinnitus examiner noted that the Veteran's condition would not impact his ability to work.  A September 2020 VA heart conditions examiner noted that that the Veteran worked as an electrician and that he had to pace himself and be aware of safety concerns with driving, climbing, and experiencing unstable angina.  An August 2022 VA hypertension examiner noted that the impact of the Veteran's condition on his ability to perform occupational functioning and ordinary activities was that he had noticed a marked decreased in his energy and stamina over the past several years.  He developed shortness of breath and fatigue and would need to stop what he was doing and rest.  A December 2022 VA heart conditions examiner noted that the Veteran's condition limited his physical exertion and that he needed frequent breaks with activity.  A February 2024 VA heart conditions examiner noted that the Veteran avoided long walks and limited his lifting of items that were more than 20 pounds and limited his standing and walking to up to 4 hours per day.  

At the Veteran's April 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran reported that while working as an electrician, climbing ladders and carrying supplies and equipment required for the job had become impossible due to the limitations imposed by his heart disability.  

Given the probative evidence, to include the VA examination reports and the Veteran's statements, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, particularly his CAD, inhibit his ability to maintain substantially gainful employment in a physical work environment and a sedentary work environment.  With respect to physical work, the record supports that the Veteran's CAD make full time physical work highly difficult, to include performing duties that are necessary an electrician.  As such, the Board finds that the Veteran could not perform physical tasks commensurate with his work history on a basis that would allow him to maintain substantially gainful employment.

With respect to sedentary work, the Veteran has strictly been employed as an electrician, a profession that inevitably and inherently requires physical work.  Therefore, given the Veteran's work history which is exclusively as an electrician that involves physical work, the Board does not believe that he would be able to routinely secure work in a sedentary environment.

The Board finds that the Veteran's overall disability picture depicts impairment that precludes obtaining and following substantially gainful employment.  Accordingly, the Board will resolve reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and find that it is factually ascertainable that TDIU is warranted based on the Veteran's CAD.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
