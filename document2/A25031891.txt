DOCKET NO. 201008-115372
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine, intervertebral disc syndrome, and spinal stenosis (hereinafter back condition) is granted.

The appeal seeking a rating in excess of 10 percent for right eye retinal tear/detachment (claimed as detached retina as a result of hand grenade explosion) is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his back condition is at least as likely as not related to his service.

2. In December 2024, at an evidentiary hearing and prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received explicit, unambiguous notification from the Veteran, who had full understanding of the consequences of his request, that a withdrawal of his appeal seeking a rating in excess of 10 percent for right eye retinal tear/detachment was requested.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a back condition have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

2. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal seeking entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right eye retinal tear/detachment have been met, and the appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7105(b), (d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1969 to August 1970.  His military awards and decorations include the Bronze Star Medal with "V" Device, Combat Action Ribbon, and Purple Heart.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from two separate rating decisions issued in January 2020 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the October 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held in December 2024.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Service connection for a back condition

The Veteran contends that his back was injured when following a 1969 explosion which threw him from his boat onto a tree in the Republic of Vietnam.  The Veteran also contends that he has had back pain since the explosion and primarily self-medicated his back condition until receiving treatment from a pain center, and thus his current back condition is related to the in-service back injury.  See December 2024 Hearing Transcript; December 2024 statement from Veteran; and March 2016 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, such as arthritis, will also be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994).  Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).

When the evidence is in approximate balance in the Veteran's favor or nearly equal regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of a back condition as evidenced by a VA examination dated July 2016, in which the Veteran's back condition was diagnosed variously as degenerative arthritis of the spine, intervertebral disc syndrome, and spinal stenosis.  Arthritis is an enumerated condition under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Walker, 708 F.3d at 1331.  In the January 2020 rating decision, the AOJ also identified as a favorable finding that the Veteran's private treatment records reflected that had current diagnoses of lumbosacral spondylosis without myelopathy, spinal stenosis of lumbar region, low back pain and lumbar radiculopathy.  Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran's current back condition began during service or is at least as likely as not related to the in-service injury, event, or disease.  For the reasons that follow, and in resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that began during active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the Veteran's military personnel records reflect that in October 1969 he was injured during the blowing of bunkers when a "secondary explosion erupted from booby trapped bunker causing slight shrapnel wound under left armpit of [the Veteran]."  He was medically evacuated to a surgical hospital for treatment.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2016.  At this examination, the Veteran again reported that he was thrown off a boat about four feet and into a tree by a hand grenade explosion in 1969.  He also reported that he was not seen for back pain while in service but experienced progressively worse lower back pains about 1 year after he was discharged from service.  The examiner concluded that it would be speculative to state that any of the Veteran's current back conditions were related to his military service because the Veteran's 1970 separation examination documented a normal spine and because the Veteran did not seek medical attention for back pain until about 20 years after he was discharged from service and he did not receive any diagnosis of any specific back condition until 30+ years after he was discharged from service.  

At the December 2024 hearing, the Veteran testified that a grenade explosion blew him off the boat he was on patrol on and caused him to hit a tree.  He was then medically evacuated by helicopter to a field hospital for three weeks.  After discharge from the hospital, he returned to active duty but continued to have back issues until he separated from service.  However, because the Veteran was serving in the field during combat, there were no records of his back issues during this time.  The Veteran testified that he was in constant pain following his service but not to the point that he was unable to work and although he was hurting, he self-medicated with ibuprofen and did not see a doctor.  He also testified that after service, he worked at a steel mill in a position that did not require physical labor or his back.  The Veteran reported that he began seeking treatment from a neurosurgeon in the 1990s who then sent him to a pain center.  

In December 2024, the Veteran also submitted a detailed statement explaining his treatment history, starting from the 1969 explosion, in which he stated that he attempted to seek treatment from various VA medical facilities in the 1970s to 1980 and then again from about 2004 to 2010.  After being rejected by a VA treatment facility in Ohio, he became upset and angry about how he was treated by VA and only went to VA for yearly physicals and bloodwork.  The Veteran also reported that he began seeing a private doctor, Dr. A.G., at an orthopedic center for injections and pain management in 2019 as his pain was getting unbearable and he needed help.

In December 2024, the Veteran submitted private treatment records as well as two, separate statements from Dr. A.G. dated in January 2020 and March 2021.  Dr. A.G. explained that the Veteran consistently maintained that he injured his back in an explosion in service and explained that the Veteran's current back injuries, particularly the wedging of T11 and T12, "likely were due to trauma a long time ago and this could definitely be due to a shockwave exposure from explosions of a grenade".  Dr. A.G. stated that he had treated the Veteran in August 2019 and stated that "it is clear to [him] that [the Veteran's back and other inflammatory pain and arthritis] [were] definitely service related" and stemmed initially, from acute and acute on chronic trauma to the lumbar spine causing his first injury to the L4-5 and L5-Si areas, and likely either Vertebral compression fractures or Shruorl's Nodes of the TI I and T12 Vertebral Bodies.  Dr. A.G. also stated that in reviewing the records, he felt confident in stating the Veteran's current back degenerations were service related and concluded his statement by stating that he could say that with a high degree of medical certainty that the Veteran's disability and injuries described in his letter are service related based on all the information and years of treating the Veteran.  The Board notes that Dr. A.G. is a pain medicine doctor and the director of interventional pain, spine, and nerve medication at an orthopedic center.

The Board finds that the foregoing evidence, viewed in terms most favorable to the Veteran, is at least in equipoise that the Veteran suffered a back injury in service which has continued since as evidenced by the consistent post-service medical history the Veteran has maintained regarding his back pain and origin.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d).

While no treatment records exist from during the applicable presumptive period, the Board finds that the Veteran continued to experience the same symptoms from service to the present.  The Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of back pain during that period but did not seek treatment because he could still work and was able to manage the pain through self-medication.  The Veteran's statements are credible and entitled to probative weight, as they are internally consistent and consistent with other evidence of record documenting treatment for back-related problems.  Notably, the Veteran has consistently reported that his back problems started from being thrown into a tree by an explosion to VA examiners and his private medical providers.  The Veteran's military service record confirms that he was injured in an explosion in combat in 1969.  There is no evidence to the contrary.  Rather, the Veteran's private back treatment spanning is well documented in his treatment records.  VA treatment records from 2011 also document a past medical history of chronic back pain and spinal stenosis.  Thus, the Board finds the Veteran credible as to his in-service experiences and post-service symptoms recollection and affords the Veteran's statements significant probative weight.

The Board acknowledges the negative nexus opinion provided by the July 2016 VA examiner.  However, the VA examiner's opinion was insufficient because it was based substantially on the absence of treatment records showing chronicity during service or after service.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007).  The opinion also did not consider the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements regarding the Veteran's reported back pain and self-medication during and following service.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 259 (2020) (an examiner's opinion must address relevant lay statements in order to include enough detail to inform the Board's decision).  Consequently, the Board finds that the VA examiner's negative nexus opinion cannot serve as a basis for a denial of service connection and affords the July 2016 VA opinion little probative value.

In contrast, the Board finds the private opinions by Dr. A.G. highly probative as they were based on a review of the Veteran's records and his treatment of the Veteran as a patient at an orthopedic center.  Notably, the Board is prohibited from developing additional evidence for the purpose of obtaining evidence against a claimant's case. See Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003). 

Thus, upon review of the private opinions, the Veteran's December 2024 testimony, and the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current back condition arose in or is related to his service.  Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board concludes that the Veteran's back disability began during active service or is related to his service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Notably, the Veteran has consistently maintained that he first injured his back in service (from an explosion during a combat patrol in the Republic of Vietnam) which has continued and progressively worsened since.

Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for a back condition is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right eye retinal tear/detachment

Any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed may be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal of a claim must be "explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action."  See Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2018) and DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 47 (2011).

The Veteran withdrew this appeal seeking a rating in excess of 10 percent for right eye retinal tear/detachment at an evidentiary hearing.  Thus, the withdrawal is only sufficient if it was (1) explicit, (2) unambiguous, and (3) done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action on the part of the claimant.  DeLisio, 25 Vet. App. at 57; see Acree, 891 F.3d at 1014.

At the December 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran was informed of the consequences of withdrawal, and while on record, he explicitly and unambiguously withdrew this appeal with a full understanding of the consequences of that action.  The Veteran's representative also agreed on the record to the withdrawal of this appeal.  Therefore, the Board finds this withdrawal valid, and the issue is no longer on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.204.  Given the withdrawal of the issue, the Board no longer has jurisdiction to review it, and this appeal is dismissed.
