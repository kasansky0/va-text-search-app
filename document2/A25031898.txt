ORDER

The appeal of the proposed reduction in the disability rating for service-connected left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, impairment of thigh, is dismissed.

The appeal of the proposed reduction in the disability rating for service-connected left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, limitation of extension, is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The December 2023 rating decision that proposed to reduce the evaluation of the Veteran's service-connected left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, impairment of thigh is not a final decision and, therefore, is not appealable. 

2. A November 2024 rating decision fully restored the rating for left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, limitation of extension, thereby rendering the Veteran's appeal as to that issue moot. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. There is no question of law or fact on appeal regarding the December 2023 rating decision that proposed to decrease the disability rating for service-connected left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, impairment of thigh; the appeal must be dismissed as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the proposed reduction in the disability rating for service-connected left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, limitation of extension, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 17, 2019 to November 22, 2019.

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following her appeal of a December 2023 rating decision.

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the December 2023 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. The appeal of the proposed reduction in the disability rating for service-connected left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, impairment of thigh, is dismissed.

The Board has jurisdiction where there is a question of law or fact on appeal to the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104. Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 

Here, a dismissal of this issue is required as a matter of law.

In the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ proposed a decrease in the rating for the Veteran's service-connected left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, impairment of thigh, from 10 percent to 0 percent. In the accompanying notification letter, the Veteran was given notice of the proposal as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). (Where action by the rating agency would result in the reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments, 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) requires that a rating initially proposing the reduction or discontinuance be prepared setting out all material facts and reasons for the proposed action. The regulation requires that the beneficiary of the compensation payments be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action, furnished detailed reasons therefore, and be given 60 days from the date of the notice for the presentation of additional evidence to show that the compensation payments should be continued at their present level. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).)

The AOJ's decision to defer a ruling until a later date does not constitute a final decision by the agency, because all factual and legal questions relevant to the claim have been reserved for adjudication at a later date. Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458 (2011). In other words, a decision that merely refers to future action (i.e., proposes a future reduction) is not a determination by the AOJ and therefore the filing of a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) on such a decision does not place the issue in appellate status.

The Veteran prematurely appealed the proposed reduction in her January 2024 NOD. As the December 2023 rating decision did not effectuate a reduction, but merely proposed a rating, there is no question of law or fact for the Board to decide as to this issue. As such, the appeal related to the proposed decrease in rating for the Veteran's disability must be dismissed.

The Veteran is advised that the AOJ issued a final rating decision regarding her left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, impairment of thigh, in an April 2024 rating decision, which reduced the rating from 10 percent to 0 percent. The AOJ issued notification of that decision on April 18, 2024. If the Veteran disagrees with that final decision, she may seek review by filing an NOD with the Board or seeking further review with the AOJ by filing a Supplemental Claim or a request for Higher-Level Review, within one year of the April 18, 2024 notification of the rating decision.

2. The appeal of the proposed reduction in the disability rating for service-connected left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, limitation of extension, is dismissed.

The same December 2023 rating decision that proposed to reduce the Veteran's rating for left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, impairment of thigh, also proposed to reduce the rating for her service-connected left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, limitation of extension, from 10 percent to 0 percent. As discussed above, the Veteran prematurely appealed the proposed decision in a January 2024 NOD.  

In an April 2024 rating decision, the AOJ reduced the Veteran's rating for her service-connected left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, impairment of thigh, from 10 percent to 0 percent effective July 1, 2024. However, in a November 2024 rating decision, the AOJ restored the rating to 10 percent effective July 1, 2024.

Because the rating was restored in full and back to the date of the reduction, there remains no final action by the AOJ for the Veteran to appeal. There are no questions of fact or law to be decided by the Board in connection with this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(a). Accordingly, the appeal of the proposed reduction in the disability rating for service-connected left hip strain with post traumatic arthritis, limitation of extension, is dismissed as moot. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105.
