DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The most probative evidence of record establishes that the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorders, including PTSD and MDD are related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria are met for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and MDD.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f), 4.125(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1972 to November 1992.  For his meritorious service, he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal and Army Achievement Medal (with one oak leaf cluster), among others.   

A rating decision was issued under the legacy system in November 2014.  In October 2018, the Veteran opted into the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), by submitting a Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) election form and selecting the Higher-Level Review (HLR) option.  The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued an AMA rating decision pursuant to RAMP in February 2019.

In July 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested review of the February 2019 decision, based on new and relevant evidence.  Then, in August 2019, the AOJ issued a rating decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  In November 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) and elected the hearing docket.  In August 2023, he testified at a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).  The Board acknowledges that the undersigned did not preside over this Board hearing; however, under the modernized review system, the Veterans Law Judge who conducts a Board hearing is not required to decide the appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 7107(c); Frantzis v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 354 (2022).  A transcript is associated with the record.

Following the hearing, the Board found readjudication of the claim was warranted and remanded the claim on the merits for further development in December 2023.  The RO then continued to deny the claim in a January 2024 rating decision.  In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) and selected the evidence submission docket.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  As such, the Board's consideration of his claim is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the rating decision that he has appealed and any additional evidence submitted with his April 5, 2024, VA Form 10182 (AMA NOD) or within the permissible 90-day "grace period" following his election on that VA Form 10182 of the evidence submission option, so until July 5, 2024.

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD).

Service connection may be granted for a disability due to a disease or an injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service in the line of duty.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of: (1) a present disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a relevant disease or an injury in service; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The determination as to whether these requirements are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and an evaluation of its competency and credibility to, in turn, determine its ultimate probative value in relation to other evidence.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999).

It is not in dispute that the Veteran has a diagnosed psychiatric disability.  What must be resolved, instead, is whether it is etiologically related to his military service.  See Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309, 314 (1993) ("A determination of service connection requires a finding of the existence of a current disability and a determination of a relationship between that disability and an injury or a disease incurred in service.").

The Board finds that the most probative evidence of the record establishes that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD and MDD, is related to or the result of his service.  

Notably, in support of his claim, the Veteran submitted several private medical opinions.  In a December 2017 medical opinion, Dr. E.R.C. confirmed diagnoses of PTSD with alcohol use disorder (AUD) in remission and MDD based on DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria.  He indicated that these conditions resulted from several extremely traumatic incidents that the Veteran experienced during military service.  In addition, Dr. A.H. also confirmed a diagnosis PTSD in an April 2024 disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) and opined that it was at least as likely as not caused by the Veteran's proximity to multiple deaths of other servicemembers during active duty.

In making its determination, the Board notes the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his acquired psychiatric disorder.  In service-connection claims, VA must provide a medical examination for a medical opinion when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or establishing that certain diseases manifested during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies; and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent/recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with a service-connected disability; but (4) there is insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.15(c)(4)(i).  

Here, however, the Board finds that the December 2017 and April 2024 private medical opinions provide a sufficient basis for granting service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and MDD, on the premise it is related to his military service.  Therefore, a remand for a VA examination and opinion concerning this posited correlation is not needed.  McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 81.

Thus, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection is warranted for his acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and MDD.  As such, the claim is granted in full.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
