REMANDED

Entitlement to a disability rating greater than 10 percent for service-connected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from October 1973 to October 1977. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  The February 2024 rating decision is a higher-level review of a prior June 2023 rating decision that denied entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for service-connected GERD.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the Veteran's claim for a higher rating for GERD, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to a disability rating greater than 10 percent for service-connected GERD is remanded. 

After review of the record, the Board finds the issue on appeal must be remanded to correct a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The Veteran claimed entitlement to a disability rating higher than 10 percent for his service-connected GERD in March 2023.  He appeared at an esophageal conditions examination in April 2023.  At the examination, the Veteran reported that he continues to treat his GERD symptoms with omeprazole.  Indeed, records of VA care on file show that the Veteran has been managed with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, since 2004.  See an April 26, 2019, VA Pharmacy Note.  

In a brief attached to the Veteran's May 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran's attorney argued that the April 2023 examination did not adequately address what the Veteran's symptoms would be in an unmedicated state.  See the May 29, 2024, Addendum to VA Form 10182.  

It is unclear whether the April 2023 examiner's estimations of the severity of the Veteran's GERD took into account the effects of his medication.  It is well settled that VA is required to consider all issues either raised by the claimant or the evidence of record.  See Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).  Here, the April 2023 examination report reflects the Veteran's contention that he has used omeprazole to treat his GERD for relief, i.e., to control his symptoms.  Stated otherwise, the Veteran contended that his use of medication impacts the frequency, severity, and duration of his symptoms, factors which are essential to assigning an appropriate rating for his disability in this case.  Prior to adjudicating the Veteran's claim, the AOJ should have obtained a medical opinion clarifying to what degree, if at all quantifiable, the Veteran's GERD is more severe when discounting the ameliorative effects of medication.  Id.; see also Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet.App. __, __, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (Mar. 12, 2025) (noting that to comply with the holding of Jones (David J.) v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012), where a relevant Diagnostic Code does not reference medication use, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects and evaluate the baseline severity of each disability).  On remand, a new examination should be scheduled addressing these rating factors.  See Barr v Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (holding that when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate). 

The Board notes in passing that had the Veteran's claim for increase been filed after May 19, 2024, a remand for a medical assessment discussing and discounting the ameliorative effects of medication would not be necessary, as the rating criteria for GERD were amended as of that date, and now take into consideration the need for medications.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7206.  As such, the holding in Jones, referenced above, would not have applied, and the Board would be permitted to take into consideration the effects of medication when rating the GERD disability.  

However, in this case, the Veteran's claim for increase pre-dated the May 2024 amendments, and his GERD disability was evaluated under former Diagnostic Code 7346, analogous to a hiatal hernia.  The former criteria do not include consideration of the use of medications.  Because the amended criteria cannot be applied retrospectively (i.e., prior to May 19, 2024), but the former criteria may be applied prospectively if more favorable to the Veteran, this remand for an additional medical assessment of the Veteran's GERD is necessary so that VA may make an informed decision as to whether the Veteran's disability, when rated under the former criteria, may warrant the assignment of a higher rating. 

Upon readjudication, the AOJ is reminded that for all times prior to May 19, 2024, only the former rating criteria may apply, and from May 19, 2024, to the present, either the former or current criteria, whichever is more favorable, applies.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a GERD examination.  The examiner should review the Veteran's medical records, and take a history from the Veteran as to the nature and progression of his symptoms.  The examiner should clarify the frequency, severity, and duration of the Veteran's GERD symptoms, and to the extent possible, estimate its severity without considering the ameliorative effects of medication, to specifically include the Veteran's use of omeprazole.   

If this estimate cannot be provided without resorting to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

All opinions should be supported with a medical explanation or rationale.
