An earlier effective date of August 27, 2019, for service connection of right sciatica is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

An earlier effective date of August 27, 2019, for service connection of left sciatica is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

Service connection for left knee condition is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

Service connection for right knee condition is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

Service connection for bilateral pes planus is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

Service connection for hallux valgus left foot is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

Service connection for sacroiliac joint pain is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On November 3, 2019, the Veteran filed her initial claim for VA disability benefits related to her back disability (degenerative arthritis of the spine) and left and right lower extremity sciatica, within a year of the August 27, 2019, Intent to File. 

2. The Veteran's left knee condition is related to her active service.

3. The Veteran's right knee condition is related to her active service.

4. The Veteran's pre-existing bilateral pes planus was aggravated by her active service. 

5. The Veteran's pre-existing hallux valgus left foot was aggravated by her active service.

6. The Veteran's claimed sacroiliac joint pain is a symptom of a service-connected disability rather than a standalone condition for which service connection may be separately warranted.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1988 to September 1992.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2020 Regional Office (RO) Higher-Level Review rating decision.  In that rating decision, the RO denied service connection for bilateral pes planus, degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis, hallux valgus left foot, hammer toe left foot, left knee condition, right knee condition, right sciatica, left sciatica, and sacroiliac joint pain.

In April 2021, VA received the Veteran's 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD). The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

The Direct Review docket does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Thus, as this is a Direct Review appeal, the record closed as of the June 2020 rating decision.

Evidence added during an ineligible period will not be considered.  Should the Veteran want VA to consider evidence submitted outside the eligible period, the Veteran should submit a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, identifying such evidence. 

Initially, the Board notes that in the August 2022 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine, and in a November 2022 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for right and left lower extremity sciatica.  The assigned effective date for each of the claims was July 16, 2021.  The record reveals that the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 NOD in September 2023, seeking earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine, right lower extremity sciatica, and left lower extremity sciatica.  However, the initial claim of entitlement to service connection for these claims had been properly appealed to the Board via submission of the April 2021 VA Form 10182 NOD prior to the subsequent grants of service connection.  Thus, to best serve the Veteran, the Board has recharacterized the claims of entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine, right lower extremity sciatica, and left lower extremity sciatica as claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates under the instant appeal stream, as listed above, to more accurately reflect the issues currently before the Board.  The appeal (#230921-379206) from the September 2023 VA Form 10182 NOD will be addressed in a separate Board decision.

Earlier Effective Date

The statutory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110.  Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Where a claim is subject to the modernized review system under the AMA based on date of initial claim or by election of the veteran, provisions exist that permit an effective date based on date of claim to be "preserved" following issuance of a decision.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500.  Specifically, 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h) provides that the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession a supplemental claim, request for higher-level review, or an appeal to the Board within one year of the issuance of the decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (h).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 16, 2021, for the award of service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 16, 2021, for the award of service connection for right lower extremity sciatica

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 16, 2021, for the award of service connection for left extremity sciatica

The Veteran contends that an effective date earlier than July 16, 2021, is warranted for the awards of service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis, right lower extremity sciatica, and left lower extremity sciatica.

VA received the Veteran's Intent to File on August 27, 2019.  See August 27, 2019, VA 21-0966 Intent to File.  Within a year of the Intent to File, the Veteran filed a claim on November 3, 2019, for service connection for left and right sciatica and lumbar strain.  See November 3, 2019, VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

In a February 2020 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis (claimed as lumbar strain), left sciatica, and right sciatica.  See February 7, 2020, Rating Decision - Narrative.

In response, the Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review (HLR) request for right and left sciatica associated with degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis and degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis.  See February 11, 2020, VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review.

In the June 2020 HLR rating decision, the RO denied service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis, right sciatica, and left sciatica.  See June 13, 2020, Rating Decision - Narrative. 

In April 2021, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182 NOD indicating disagreement with the denial of service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis and right and left sciatica associated with degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis.  See April 21, 2021, VA Form 10182 NOD. 

In an April 2021 AMA Notification Letter, the Veteran was incorrectly advised that the April 2021 VA Form 10182 NOD was not properly filed under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  The letter provides that the Veteran attempted to appeal a February 2019 rating decision in the legacy system.  However, the Veteran had listed a February 2020 rating decision in the NOD, not a February 2019 rating decision.  Notably, a February 2019 rating decision is not of record.  See April 28, 2021, AMA Notification Letter.  The Board has since corrected this error, and the instant appeal has been docketed to the June 2020 rating decision (issued within a year of the April 2021 VA Form 10182).

In response to the incorrect advisement, the Veteran soon thereafter filed a claim for lumbar strain and left and right sciatica.  See June 27, 2021, VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim. Thereafter, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim for left sciatica, radiculopathy femoral right/left, and sacroiliac joint pain.  See July 16, 2021, VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim.

These newly filed claims resulted in the issuance of multiple rating decisions, including in August 2022 and November 2022, wherein the RO granted service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis and for left and right lower extremity sciatica, effective July 16, 2021, the date of receipt of the Supplemental Claim.  See August 19, 2022, Rating Decision - Narrative.

The Board finds that the Veteran properly appealed the June 2020 rating decision using the April 2021 VA Form 10182 NOD.  The June 2020 rating decision was issued in response to the Veteran's initial claim of entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis, right lower extremity sciatica, and left lower extremity sciatica, filed on November 3, 2019, within a year of the August 27, 2019, Intent to File.

As such, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of August 27, 2019, is warranted for the award of service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis, right lower extremity sciatica, and left lower extremity sciatica.  The claims are granted.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  "To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"- the so-called "nexus" requirement."  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection for certain chronic diseases may also be established based upon a legal "presumption" by showing that the disease manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  In addition, service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after service when all the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected condition.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of her current symptomatology.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  "Symptoms, not treatment, are the essence of any evidence of continuity of symptomatology." See Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 496 (1997) (citing Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991)).

1.  Entitlement to service connection for left knee condition 

2. Entitlement to service connection for right knee condition

The Veteran contends that her bilateral knee conditions are related to her active service, specifically performing work duties as an aircraft armament systems technician.  She began experiencing knee pain related to her current knee condition while on active duty in the 1990s.  See March 24, 2025, Appellate Brief; see also July 18, 2023, VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. 

While the Board may not consider new evidence submitted after the June 2020 rating decision, the Board is bound by the favorable findings in all rating decisions, including those issued after the rating decision on appeal.

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The RO found that the Veteran was diagnosed with left and right knee mild degenerative changes, per VA treatment records received in February 2020.  During a VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with left knee degenerative arthritis other than post-traumatic and right knee meniscal tear with degenerative arthritis other than post-traumatic.  The Veteran's private examiner, J.M., diagnosed the Veteran with focal horizontal tear involving the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus on December 7, 2021.  The claimed disability is a chronic disease which may be presumptively linked to the Veteran's military service.  Military records show service that meets the minimum requirements under 38 C.F.R. 3.307(1).  Degenerative arthritis may qualify for presumptive service connection if manifested to a compensable degree within the time limits under 38 C.F.R. 3.307.  The Veteran has sufficient service to meet the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection for chronic diseases under 38 C.F.R. 3.309(a).  See February 7, 2020, Rating Decision - Narrative; see also June 13, 2020, Rating Decision - Narrative; July 21, 2021, Rating Decision - Narrative; December 13, 2021, Rating Decision - Narrative; January 21, 2022, Rating Decision - Narrative; April 7, 2022, Rating Decision - Narrative; August 19, 2022, Rating Decision - Narrative; November 10, 2022, Rating Decision - Narrative; April 7, 2023, Rating Decision - Narrative; November 22, 2023, Rating Decision - Narrative. 

The remaining question for the Board is whether the Veteran's current disabilities began during service or are at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran has current disabilities (left knee degenerative arthritis and right knee meniscal tear with degenerative arthritis) that began during active service with continuity of symptoms to the present.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Service treatment records do not indicate complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to her left or right knee conditions. 

VA treatment records include a May 6, 1993, progress note providing that the Veteran was seen for pain in her feet and knees; she received an assessment of knee pain.  A July 16, 1997, general note shows that the Veteran complained of feet and knee pain.  She stated that she felt that her knees hurt as a result of the problems with her feet.  See February 5, 2017, Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility; see also November 14, 2019, CAPRI.

VA treatment records include a February 12, 2020, laboratory note revealing that radiology/imaging tests showed right and left knee mild degenerative changes.  A February 12, 2020, primary care note shows that the Veteran's chief complaint was bilateral knee pain and swelling for over a year.  Pain was worse with prolonged standing and walking.  See February 15, 2020, CAPRI.

The Board affords high probative value to the lay evidence of record, including statements from the Veteran asserting that she has been experiencing bilateral knee pain, continuously since her active service.  There is no indication in the record that the Veteran lacks credibility; the evidence available for review shows that she has reported knee pain repeatedly throughout the appeal period.  Based on the above, the evidence is in relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran has experienced left and right knee pain continuously since service, "for lay persons are competent to report observable physical conditions," and the Board finds her credible.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).

To the extent that the grants of service connection in these matters are based primarily on lay evidence, "nothing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] require both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself."  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337.

Here, the record shows that the Veteran has experienced knee pain since at least May 6, 1993, within one year of separation from active service, and that she has continued to report bilateral knee pain to the present time.  There is no competent evidence available for review that shows otherwise.

At this point, a request for another medical examination or opinion could be construed as obtaining additional evidence for the sole purpose of denying a claim, which is impermissible.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c) (The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination.)

In light of the above, the Board finds that the evidence sufficiently establishes that the Veteran's left and right knee conditions began during active service and have continued to the present.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current left and right knee conditions are related to her active service.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for left and right knee conditions is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claims are granted.

3. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus 

4. Entitlement to service connection for hallux valgus left foot

The Veteran contends that her bilateral pes planus and hallux valgus of the left foot began exhibiting symptoms during her active service, while performing as an aircraft armament systems technician.  The Veteran asserts that at the onset of the pain in her feet, she began experiencing knee and back pain in the 1990s.  See March 24, 2025, Appellate Brief; see also July 18, 2023, VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. 

While the Board may not consider new evidence submitted after the June 2020 rating decision, the Board is bound by the favorable findings in all rating decisions, including those issued after the rating decision on appeal.

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence of CUE.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The RO found that the evidence of record shows current diagnoses of bilateral pes planus and left hallux valgus (per the November 2019 VA examination) and that both bilateral pes planus and left hallux valgus existed prior to the Veteran's military service, noting that STRs show pes planus and hallux valgus upon entrance examination on January 24, 1987.  The Veteran received treatment for left hallux valgus on February 13, 1997, at the Las Vegas VAMC.  The claimed primary-disability is service-connected (right foot hallux valgus).  See February 7, 2020, Rating Decision - Narrative; see also June 13, 2020, Rating Decision - Narrative; July 21, 2021, Rating Decision - Narrative; December 13, 2021, Rating Decision - Narrative; January 21, 2022, Rating Decision - Narrative; April 7, 2022, Rating Decision - Narrative; August 19, 2022, Rating Decision - Narrative; November 10, 2022, Rating Decision - Narrative; April 7, 2023, Rating Decision - Narrative; November 22, 2023, Rating Decision - Narrative. 

Service treatment records include a January 24, 1987, report of medical examination upon entrance, revealing a normal clinical evaluation other than for the feet. The examiner noted pes planus and hallux valgus asymptomatic.  The summary of defects and diagnoses shows that the examiner noted "pes planus, hallux valgus - mild asymptomatic."  The Veteran reported no health conditions in the report of medical history on January 24, 1987.  The examiner noted in the physician's summary that the Veteran "denied asthma, cardiac, feet, back, and joint problems."  A January 12, 1988, record noting "entrance physical screened ... and no significant abnormalities were found except as listed below."  The record does not provide any specific abnormalities.  A July 30, 1991, radiologic consultation request/report regarding bilateral feet, includes a radiologic report on July 31, 1991, showing very minimal hallux valgus present (left foot) and minimal hallux valgus with no significant degenerative changes of the first metatarsophalangeal articulation (right foot).  The impression was minimal bilateral hallux valgus.

Thus, as the Veteran's bilateral pes planus and hallux valgus were both noted at entry, the presumption of soundness does not apply.  Due to the pre-existing condition, the Veteran will not prevail under a theory of service incurrence for the disorder, but she may proceed under an aggravation theory.  Paulson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 466, 468 (1995).  In that case, the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1153 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.306 apply.  Jensen v. Brown, 19 F.3d 1413, 1417 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

A preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active military service, where there is an increase in disability during such service unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease.  38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(a).  The burden is on VA to establish a lack of aggravation of the preexisting disability.  VA must show that there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease.  38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b); see also Jensen, 19 F.3d at 1417; Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  This includes medical facts and principles which may be considered to determine whether the increase is due to the natural progress of the condition.

Aggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during, and subsequent to service.  Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096; Cotant v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 116, 123-30 (2003); 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b).

VA treatment records include a May 6, 1993, progress note which shows that the Veteran was seen for pain in her feet and knees.  A February 13, 1997, radiology report notes a clinical history of "hallux abduction of left foot, bunionectomy x 4 years old patient."  The report noted that the examination showed flattening of the medial aspect of the first metatarsal head probably from prior bunionectomy.  There is a flattened calcification adjacent to the distal segment of the first metatarsal and medially situated.  The remainder of the foot shows no gross significant bone or joint abnormality.  A July 16, 1997, general note indicating that the Veteran complained of feet and knee pain; she was assessed with right foot hallux abductus and limitus.  A November 20, 1997, progress note provides that the Veteran had chronic foot pain.  She received an assessment of knee pain.  See February 5, 2017, Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility; see also November 14, 2019, CAPRI.

A July 13, 2011, medical record noted that physical examination of the left foot revealed no evidence of painful motion, swelling, tenderness, instability, weakness, abnormal weight bearing.  It noted mild hallux valgus with no tenderness or limited range of motion.  See July 21, 2011, Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for foot conditions in January 2020.  The examiner noted diagnoses of flat foot (pes planus), hammer toes, hallux valgus (right and left), and degenerative arthritis.  The date of onset was noted as 1988, with details noted as "accumulation over time."  Since onset the condition remained the same, with current symptoms of constant pain in both feet.  The Veteran reported pain of the foot with prolonged walking.  The examiner opined that arthritis of the left foot, bilateral pes planus, bilateral bone spur, and left hallux valgus were new conditions unrelated to the service connected condition.  Right foot hallux valgus status post bunionectomy and metatarsal resection and hammertoe (right second toe) are not known to cause hallux valgus on the left foot, bilateral bone spurs, arthritis left foot, or bilateral pes planus.  The examiner determined that it was not feasible to specify which of the Veteran's symptoms and findings correspond to each diagnosis.  See January 30, 2020, C&P Examination.

The Board affords the January 2020 VA examination minimal probative value.  Of note, the Board takes issue with the January 2020 VA examiner's assertion that the Veteran's condition stayed the same since onset and that her current symptoms were constant pain in both feet.  As discussed above, upon entrance into service, both of these claimed conditions were noted as mild and asymptomatic.  Moreover, the Veteran did not report experiencing any symptoms from these conditions.  Thus, the Board concludes that the Veteran's bilateral pes planus and hallux valgus evolved from asymptomatic, and that during service the conditions were aggravated, leading to the reports of foot pain shortly after separation.

The Veteran is competent and credible in her reporting of painful feet due to her pes planus and hallux valgus left foot.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (a veteran is competent to provide lay evidence, and when credible, it is competent to establish the presence of continuous symptoms for a claimed disability during and since separation from service); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (holding lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence). 

The evidence of record shows that while the Veteran's bilateral pes planus and hallux valgus were noted on entry, at that time the examiner noted that they were mild and asymptomatic.  However, as shown above, the Veteran began reporting her foot pain shortly after service, has received treatment for these conditions, and has continued reporting her foot pain to the present day.  Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral pes planus and hallux valgus left foot worsened during service, as the conditions began with no symptoms and shortly after service manifested in pain that she had not previously experienced.

As there is no conflicting evidence of record, aggravation is presumed.  Again, the presumption of aggravation can only be rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence that the increase was due to the natural progress of the disease.  The VA examination for foot conditions did not address aggravation of the Veteran's claimed conditions, rather the VA examiner only addressed whether they were secondary to a service-connected disability.  As there is no evidence available for review that the increase was due to the natural progress of the diseases, VA has not met its burden, and the presumption of aggravation has not been rebutted.

At this point, a request for another medical examination or opinion could be construed as obtaining additional evidence for the sole purpose of denying a claim, which is impermissible.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c) (The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination.)

To the extent that the grants of service connection in these matters are based primarily on lay evidence, "nothing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] require both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself."  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337.

Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish etiology if the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's preexisting bilateral pes planus and hallux valgus left foot were noted on entry into service as mild and asymptomatic and were aggravated by service.  The above evidence of record reflects that the Veteran has experienced worsening bilateral pes planus and left hallux valgus symptoms shortly after service, continuing to the present time, therefore, establishing the nexus element between the current bilateral pes planus and left hallux valgus and the in-service aggravation.  As such, service connection for bilateral pes planus and for hallux valgus left foot, based on aggravation of a pre-existing disorder, is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claims are granted.

5. Entitlement to service connection for sacroiliac joint pain

The Veteran contends that her claimed sacroiliac joint pain is related to her active service, to include as due to serving as an aircraft armament systems technician.  The Veteran asserts that her back pain started during active service in the 1990s.  See March 24, 2025, Appellate Brief; see also July 18, 2023, VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

While the Board may not consider new evidence submitted after the June 2020 rating decision, the Board is bound by the favorable findings in all rating decisions, including those issued after the rating decision on appeal.

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence of CUE.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The RO provided favorable findings that she was diagnosed with a disability, noting that a September 25, 2019, VA treatment records show mild degenerative changes of the sacroiliac joints.  See August 19, 2022, Rating Decision - Narrative; see also, July 21, 2021, Rating Decision - Narrative.

As noted above, the Veteran was previously awarded service connection for her degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis, as well as associated left and right lower extremity radiculopathy (femoral) and sciatic disabilities.

The evidence of record shows that the Veteran's currently claimed sacroiliac joint pain is a symptom of an existing disability rather than a standalone condition for which service connection may be separately warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 (prohibiting the pyramiding of symptoms).  Throughout the record the Veteran has asserted that she experiences back pain, and her back disability has been variably claimed as degenerative arthritis of the spine, lumbar strain, and sacroiliac joint pain.  The Veteran has not provided evidence or argument to indicate that the currently claimed sacroiliac joint pain is a separate and distinct disability for which service connection is warranted.  The only record specifically noting any diagnosis related to this claimed condition indicates that the Veteran had mild degenerative changes of the sacroiliac joints; otherwise, the Veteran's complaints are generally of low back pain. 

The Veteran's service-connected back disability is evaluated under Diagnostic Code 5237, which contemplates pain in the determination of the assigned disability rating.  Moreover, the Veteran's left and right lower extremity femoral radiculopathy and sciatica (associated with her service-connected back disability) are rated under Diagnostic Codes 8526 and 8520, respectively; both of these diagnostic codes contemplate pain.  While the Veteran generally asserts that her sacroiliac joint pain warrants service connection as a distinct disability, she has not been shown to possess the requisite medical training and expertise to offer a competent opinion on complex medical matters.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

As such, separately granting service connection for the claimed sacroiliac joint pain would result in improper pyramiding, that is, double compensation for the same symptom of pain.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits compensating a veteran twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment).  Notably, this is a moot point, as the evidence does not show that the Veteran has been specifically diagnosed with sacroiliac joint pain as a separate disability; rather, the medical evidence available for review shows that the Veteran's pain is a symptom of a currently diagnosed disability (service connected degenerative arthritis of the spine with scoliosis and associated left and right lower extremity radiculopathy and sciatic disabilities), and not a separately diagnosable disability in and of itself.

In sum, the weight of the evidence conclusively demonstrates that the currently claimed sacroiliac joint pain is related to one or more of her service-connected disabilities.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence of record is against the claim.  The evidence is not in approximate balance and the benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable.  Therefore, service connection for sacroiliac joint pain is not warranted, and the claim must be denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
