ORDER

Entitlement for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss has not manifested by worse than Level I in the right ear and Level II in the left ear.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.10, 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1980 to September 1981.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 Supplemental Claim rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which continued a noncompensable (0 percent) rating for bilateral hearing loss. In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, in which he elected the Direct review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another rating decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss 

The Veteran has requested an increased rating for his bilateral hearing loss, stating that he had recently sought treatment through the VA for his hearing loss. He filed the present Supplemental Claim seeking an increased rating in March 2024. 

Disability ratings for hearing loss are derived from a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations resulting from audiometric testing. See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz). 38 C.F.R. § 4.85. To evaluate the degree of disability from defective hearing, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.85, Tables VI and VII, Diagnostic Code 6100.

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a). In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral. Further, when the average pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b).

In March 2024, the Veteran reported that he sought treatment for his hearing loss at a VA medical facility, indicating that new medical evidence supported his claim. His updated VA treatment records, dated through February 2024, have been associated with the claims file. These records, however, do not indicate that the Veteran underwent audiometric testing (other than a January 2022 VA examination discussed herein), during the appeal period.

The Veteran did not attend a VA examination during the review period for this claim. However, he did attend a VA examination in January 2022. He reported difficulty understanding speech and stated that he often asked people to repeat what they have said. Puretone threshold testing showed the following results:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Average

RIGHT	 25	50	70	65	 53

LEFT	 35	45	70	70	 55

The average pure tone thresholds were 53 decibels in the right ear and 55 decibels in the left ear. Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in the right ear and 86 percent in the left ear. Applying these findings to Table VI in 38 C.F.R. § 4.85 yields a finding of Level I in the right ear and Level II in the left ear. Where hearing loss is at Level I and Level II, 0 percent rating is assigned. Id. 

Based on the results of the Veteran's VA examination, the Board does not find that a compensable rating is warranted. 

The functional effects of hearing loss on the Veteran's daily life activities and occupational functioning have been considered. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.10; Martinak v. Nicholson, 2 1 Vet. App. 447, 455-56 (2007). The Veteran discussed the impact of his hearing loss of his daily life and functioning at his examination. The Veteran has reported having trouble hearing speech. However, this is reflective of the types of functional difficulty that would be expected to be caused by mild or moderate hearing loss, and is not indicative that a higher, compensable rating would be warranted. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (Manifestations such as difficulty hearing sounds are the types of difficulties contemplated by the schedular criteria for hearing loss.). Accordingly, the examination of record is found to be sufficiently in compliance with the provisions of VA regulations, and it is adequate to determine the Veteran's level of hearing impairment.

The most probative medical evidence as to the nature of the appellant's hearing loss is the audiometric findings, and those discussed above reveal that the Veteran's hearing loss does not warrant an initial compensable rating. The claim is denied. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, the evidence is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (2021).
