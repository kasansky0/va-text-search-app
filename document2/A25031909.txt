DOCKET NO. 240920-477891
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for the aid and attendance of another person/housebound status is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In January 2025, the Veteran died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active-duty service from May 1973 to October 1975 in the United States Air Force.  This matter is on appeal from a September 2023 decision of the VA Regional Office.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal.  Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim at this time and must dismiss this appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim.  This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b).  Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

The VA Regional Office must decide all requests for substitution in the first instance.  38?C.F.R. §?3.1010(e)(1).  In March 2025, VA received a request for substitution.  To date, the VA Regional Office has not ruled on that request.  If the request for substitution is granted, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket.  38 C.F.R. §?20.1302(a).
