ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record is against finding that tinnitus began during the Veteran's active service, within a year of his discharge, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria are not met for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 2007 to October 2012.  For his meritorious service, he received that Navy "E" Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Medal, among other awards and decorations.

In August 2023, he filed a claim for service connection for tinnitus, which was denied by the local regional office (RO) in a September 2023 rating decision.  The Veteran subsequently submitted a VA Form 20-0996, requesting Higher-Level Review (HLR) in April 2024.  In a July 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision, the RO continued to deny the Veteran's claim.

In response, in August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (i.e., an AMA Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) and requested "direct review" of the evidence in his appeal by a Veterans Law Judge.  According to the Direct Review docket, no additional evidence received after the rating decision he has appealed may be considered; rather, review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the decision he appealed, which is the September 2023 rating decision.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

To establish direct service connection, there must be the existence of a present disability, in-service incurrence or aggravation of a relevant disease or an injury, and a causal relationship ("nexus") between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Also, certain chronic disabilities, including other organic diseases of the nervous system such as tinnitus, will presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree (meaning to at least 10-percent disabling) within one year of separation from service.  This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

For the showing of chronic disease in service, or during a presumptive period, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  If chronicity in service is not established, or legitimately questionable, then a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge is required to support the claim but may, in this circumstance, establish the required correlation between the disability being claimed and the Veteran's service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran is competent to state that he suffers from tinnitus, the evidence of record is against finding that it began during his active service, within a year of his discharge, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease including noise exposure or acoustic trauma.

Service Treatment Records

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not contain evidence that he experienced tinnitus at any time while in service either in the way of a relevant subjective complaint (e.g., notable symptom, etc.) or objective clinical finding (pertinent diagnosis).

In cases involving combat, VA is prohibited from drawing a negative inference from silence in the STRs.  See Forshey v. Principi, 284 F.3d 1335, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (en banc) (cautioning that negative evidence, meaning actual evidence weighing against a party, must not be equated with the absence of substantive evidence).  Conversely, in cases, as here, where this inference is not prohibited [i.e., non-combat scenarios], the Board may use silence in the STRs as contradictory evidence if the alleged injury, disease, or related symptoms ordinarily would have been recorded in the STRs.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).  See also Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36 (2010) (For non-combat Veterans providing non-medical related lay testimony regarding an event during service [or where, as here, the injury claimed is not alleged to have occurred in combat], the holding in Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006), is distinguishable; the lack of documentation in service records must be weighed against the Veteran's statements.).  Buchanan had held that lay evidence such as that proffered by the Veteran and his comrades is potentially competent to support the presence of a disability, even where not corroborated by contemporaneous medical evidence such as actual treatment records (STRs, etc.).

In this circumstance, where a claimed injury, disease or event is not alleged to have occurred during combat, the Board must make two preliminary findings to rely on this negative inference (see Kahana):

1. First, the Board must find that the STRs appear to be complete, at least in relevant part.  If the STRs are not complete in relevant part, then silence in the STRs is merely the absence of evidence and not substantive negative evidence.

2. If the STRs are complete in relevant part, then the Board must find that injury, disease, or related symptoms ordinarily would have been recorded had they occurred. In making this determination, the Board may be required to consider the limits of its own competence on medical issues.

Therefore, the mere absence of evidence does not necessarily equate to unfavorable evidence.  Indeed, as mentioned there are a line of precedent cases supporting this proposition.  See e.g., Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 239 (2012); Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011); Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1336.

The Federal Circuit Court also has held however that, while the absence of contemporaneous records does not, in and of itself, render lay testimony not credible, the Board may weigh the absence of contemporaneous records when assessing the credibility of lay evidence.  See Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1336 ("Nor do we hold that the Board cannot weigh the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence against the lay evidence of record.").  Moreover, although the Board cannot reject a claimant's statements merely because he is an interested party, the claimant's interest may affect the credibility of his testimony when considered in light of other factors.  See Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991); accord Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1337 (holding that "the Board, as fact finder, is obligated to, and fully justified in, determining whether lay evidence is credible in and of itself, i.e., because of possible bias....").

Here, the Veteran did not serve in combat, and there is no suggestion that his STRs are not complete at least in relevant part.  Thus, the fact that he did not complain of tinnitus while in service and did not receive this diagnosis is a probative indication he did not have this condition while in service.

Continuity of Symptomology

Tinnitus also was not shown, certainly not to the required minimum compensable degree of at least 10-percent disabling, within one year of the Veteran's separation from service, so by October 2013, to in turn warrant presuming it was incurred during his service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).

Indeed, there is no evidence, medical or otherwise, showing a complaint of tinnitus until his August 2023 claim for benefits, over 10 years following the Veteran's separation from active service, so for more than a decade.  See Maxon v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (ruling that a prolonged period without medical complaint can be considered, along with other factors, as evidence of whether an injury or a disease was incurred in service resulting in any chronic or persistent disability).  See also Mense v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 354, 356 (1991) (affirming the Board's denial of service connection where the Veteran-claimant had failed to account for lengthy time period between service and initial symptoms of disability).

Tinnitus is "a noise in the ear, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking."  See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1714 (28th ed. 1994).  Tinnitus is often subjective in nature; indeed, because of its inherently subjective nature, even a layman such as the Veteran is considered competent to report the observable manifestations of this condition like this ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking sound mentioned.  He is competent to provide evidence regarding tinnitus, as it is a condition readily apparent through the senses.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report symptoms that require only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as they come to him through his senses).  Because tinnitus is "subjective," its existence is generally determined by whether the claimant claims to experience it.  Indeed, for VA purposes, tinnitus has been specifically found to be a disorder with symptoms that can be identified through lay observation alone.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).

This means tinnitus is the type of chronic condition, per se, since contemplated by 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), which the Veteran can establish is related to or the result of his service by showing continuity of symptomology since his service under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  However, here the Veteran's treatment records are unremarkable for subjective complaints of tinnitus, much less objective confirmation of it for many years after conclusion of his service.  Other than his claim for service connection in August 2023, no other treatment records in his claims file mention complaints of tinnitus or other symptoms commonly associated with this disease.  

Current Disability

Additionally, the August 2023 VA examination indicates that the Veteran does not experience tinnitus, but instead has transient ear noise which manifests as unilateral ear noise lasting several seconds to a minute in a random, immeasurable pattern.  Thus, the August 2023 VA examination noted that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of tinnitus.  And significantly, prior to the September 2023 rating decision on appeal, there is no evidence to the contrary.  There is no formal notation of tinnitus in the record, nor does the medical evidence of record support the notion that any tinnitus has been ongoing since the Veteran's time in the Navy.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997).  That a condition or injury occurred in service alone is not enough; there must be a disability resulting from that condition or injury.  Id. at 1332.  As such, even though the Veteran has asserted that he has tinnitus resulting from his military service, without a current disability, the Board cannot grant the Veteran's claim.  In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); see also Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143-44 (1992).

The Board has also considered the Veteran's contention that the VA audiologist misunderstood his description of his tinnitus symptoms, including alternating low hum or ringing sounds.  See AMA 10182 (NOD) August 20, 2024.  However, the Board finds the examination here is adequate and probative for adjudication purposes.  The examiner was fully informed of the Veteran's medical history and provided a fully articulated opinion supported by a reasoned analysis.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304; see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A] medical opinion... must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions.").  Indeed, in the same opinion, the clinician provided a positive nexus opinion regarding the Veteran's hearing loss and his service noise exposure.  She simply did not agree that his described symptoms were indicative of tinnitus.

Ultimately, there is no probative evidence indicating the Veteran's tinnitus is related to or the result of his military service.  The service records and post-service records do not support his contentions of his tinnitus dating back to his service or being the result of his service. 

 The Board finds that any assertion now being made that the Veteran suffers from tinnitus related to his military service or that he has experienced this condition continuously since his service is undermined and outweighed by the more probative medical evidence of record.  The totality of the evidence does not show that the onset of any current tinnitus occurred during his service or within one year of his discharge from service.  The Board finds it most telling that he did not report any symptoms of tinnitus until his August 2023 Application for VA Compensation and/or Pension Benefits, over 10 years after his separation from service.

Accordingly, his claim for service connection for tinnitus is denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7.  This is not a situation where the evidence is in "approximate" balance, so there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor.  See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

The Board notes that the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify new evidence indicating or suggesting there is a relationship between the Veteran's tinnitus and his military service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.
