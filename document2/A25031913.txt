ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 16, 1972, for the grant of service connection for ulcerative colitis, is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 28, 2016, for the grant of service connection for neuropathy, left upper extremity (LUE) with hand arthralgia, is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 28, 2016, for the grant of service connection for neuropathy, right upper extremity (RUE) with hand arthralgia, is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 7, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a skin disability of the bilateral hands, to include keratinization hyperkeratosis, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. February 16, 1972, the day after the Veteran was discharged from military service, is the earliest available effective date for his service-connected ulcerative colitis.

2. On July 28, 2016, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received the Veteran's service connection claim for "bilateral hands skin disorder above wrists," which was construed as to include the neuropathy, LUE with hand arthralgia and that claim was subsequently granted.  Prior to July 28, 2016, he had no pending unadjudicated claims or any other written communication that could be construed as a claim for neuropathy of an upper extremity.

3. On July 28, 2016, the VA received the Veteran's service connection claim for "bilateral hands skin disorder above wrists," which was construed as to include the neuropathy, RUE with hand arthralgia and that claim was subsequently granted.  Prior to July 28, 2016, he had no pending unadjudicated claims or any other written communication that could be construed as a claim for neuropathy of an upper extremity.

4. On July 7, 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request - Supplemental Claim for a bilateral hand/skin condition.  Prior to July 7, 2023, he had no pending unadjudicated claims or any other written communication that could be construed as a claim for a skin condition of the bilateral hands.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to July 28, 2016, for the grant of service connection for neuropathy, LUE with hand arthralgia, are not met. 38?U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to July 28, 2016, for the grant of service connection for neuropathy, RUE with hand arthralgia, are not met. 38?U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

4. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to July 7, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a skin disability of the bilateral hands, to include keratinization and hyperkeratosis, are not met. 38?U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from November 1968 to February 1972 and from November 1973 to June 1979.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision of VA's Veterans Benefits Administration, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied the claims above.  In October 2024, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) disagreeing with the September 2024, rating decision that denied his claims, and selecting the Board's Direct Review Docket. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2), the appellant has one year from his September 2024 rating decision to modify his choice of Board appeal lane, and the "Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up."  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  However, the appellant was provided with a letter, informing him that the Board was not able to adjudicate his appeal until this period has ended unless he waived the right to request a different Board review option.  The appellant provided a waiver of his right to request a different Board review option.  As such, the Board may proceed to adjudicate the claims.

Evidentiary Window

As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issues on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.  The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Veteran has not filed such a request. Specifically, in November 2024, VA received the Veteran's waiver of time to select a different Board review option.  See Veteran Correspondence, November 30, 2024; see also Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Procedural History

Immediately following his discharge from his first period of active duty service, the Veteran filed a claim and was granted entitlement to service connection for ulcerative colitis, effective February 16, 1972, the day after his discharge from service.  

In July 2016, the Veteran filed a new claim, to include entitlement to service connection for "bilateral hands skin disorder above wrists."  See VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, July 28, 2016.

Prior to the issuance of a rating decision on this claim, the Veteran submitted another claim, seeming to allege clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the February 16, 1972, rating decision that granted entitlement to service connection for ulcerative colitis, stating that the Veteran should have been awarded a 60 percent disability rating.  See VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, August 6, 2016.  In April 2017, VA informed the Veteran that a CUE is an error that is undebatable in that a reasonable mind can only conclude that the original decision was fatally flawed at the time it was made.  For VA to consider his request for revision based on CUE, he must specify the factual or legal error he believes VA made with regard to assigning the effective date in VA's prior decision.  The Veteran was informed that VA would take no further action on his request until further information was received.  See VA Correspondence, April 17, 2017.  

In September 2017, the AOJ issued a rating decision denying, inter alia, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a skin condition of the bilateral hands.  See Rating Decision, September 16, 2017.  Later in September 2017, VA received the Veteran's NOD with respect to this issue.  See NOD, September 23, 2017.

Also in September 2017, VA received correspondence from the Veteran's agent, requesting a "summary of the case," as he had filed "a CUE for 1972 many months ago for this Veteran."  See Agent Correspondence, September 25, 2017.  VA issued a response in October 2017, construing the Veteran's agent's request regarding CUE as an intent to file a new claim.  See October 2, 2017.

In November 2017, VA received a new claim from the Veteran, stating:

Veteran's disabilities, clear and unmistakable error, May 5, 1972, awarded 10% for a stomach disorder claim.  Veteran was never paid 10%, was appealed by Veteran 3 Jul 72, because was released from USAF with a 30% rating.  Evidence attached to support these contentions.

See VA Form VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, November 6, 2017.  VA responded, informing the Veteran that he did not claim a specific disability.  He was requested to tell VA the name of his claimed disability and it was noted that VA could not take further action on his claim until this information was received.  See VA Correspondence, November 14, 2017.  The Veteran was also asked to clarify a specific issue he would like to claim a CUE.  Id.  

In December 2017, VA issued a statement of the case (SOC), continuing the prior denial of entitlement to service connection for a skin disability of the bilateral hands, to include as due to herbicide agent exposure.  See SOC, December 11, 2017.  VA subsequently received the Veteran's VA Form 9, Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, in January 2018.  In June 2019, the Board issued a decision remanding this claim for additional evidentiary development, to include a new VA examination.  See Board Decision, June 25, 2019.  After completing this development, the AOJ issued a supplemental SOC (SSOC) in January 2020, continuing the denial of the claim.  See SSOC, January 2, 2020.  In March 2020, the Board again remanded the claim, to provide the Veteran with an adequate examination.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998) (Board remand confers a right on a claimant to compliance with the remand order.)

After completing this development, the AOJ issued an SSOC in March 2021.  In July 2021, the Board denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a skin disability of the bilateral hands and remanded the issue of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hand condition.  See Board Decision, July 27, 2021.  Specifically, the body of the Remand stated that it was noted in his December 2019 VA examination that the Veteran thought his finger arthritis might be related to his skin condition that was diagnosed in the early 1970's.  Further, in an April 2021 letter, D. Brown, the Veteran's wife, stated that he "complains of constant pain in his hands, his fingers, as well as his thumbs with pain, tingling, numbness and swelling of his knuckles where it makes it impossible to use his hands in everyday life."  She also stated that the pain in his hands "inhibits him from sleeping well" and that the Veteran reported that Agent Orange has contributed to this condition.  Id.

Following the requested development, in December 2021, the Board again remanded the Veteran's claim, now characterized as one for a nerve condition or pain, stiffness, numbness, and tingling of the hands, for a VA nerves examination.  See Board Remand, December 20, 2021.  Thereafter, a February 2022 rating decision granted the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for neuropathy of both upper extremities, to include hand arthralgia, effective from July 28, 2016, the date of the original claim.

Shortly thereafter, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim of entitlement to an effective date in 1972 for the grant of service connection for his bilateral upper extremity neuropathy and hand arthralgia.  See VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, February 18, 2022.  In March 2022, VA informed the Veteran that his claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date had been received, and that he may also request revision based on CUE.  He was again informed that CUE is an error that is undebatable in that a reasonable mind can only conclude that the original decision was fatally flawed at the time it was made.  For VA to consider his request for revision based on CUE, he must specify the factual or legal error he believes VA made with regard to assigning the effective date in VA's prior decision.  The Veteran was informed that VA would take no further action on his request until this information was received.  See VA Correspondence, March 2, 2022.

In April 2022, without any additional allegation of CUE, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, NOD, with the February 2022 rating decision, alleging entitlement to an earlier effective date, and selecting the Board's hearing docket.  See VA Form 10182, April 11, 2022.  He subsequently testified before a Veterans Law Judge in June 2022.  See Board Hearing Transcript, June 24, 2022.  In October 2022, the Board denied the claim.  See Board Decision, October 2022.

In November 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim, which was addressed in a December 2002 rating decision.  Therein, the Veteran's claims of entitlement to effective dates prior to July 28, 2016, for the grants of service connection neuropathy of the upper extremities and the claim for a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for ulcerative colitis were denied.  See Rating Decision, December 29, 2022.  In February 2023, VA received the Veteran's NOD with the issues addressed in the December 2022 rating decision.  See NOD, February 6, 2023.  

In March 2023, the Board denied the claim of entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for ulcerative colitis and remanded the claims of entitlement to effective dates prior to July 28, 2016, for the awards of service connection for bilateral upper extremity neuralgia based upon CUE in a prior decision.  Specifically, in its October 2022 decision, the Board acknowledged arguments the Veteran's representative made alleging CUE as part of a final 1972 rating decision granting service connection for ulcerative colitis but concluded that a CUE issue was not properly before the Board.  Subsequently, in his November 2022 supplemental claim, the Veteran's representative again asserted entitlement to earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral upper extremity neuropathy with hand arthralgia based on CUE.  Despite the Veteran's clear allegations of CUE, the Veteran's claims were not addressed in the December 2022 rating decision on appeal.  Accordingly, on Remand, the AOJ was instructed to consider these claims based on CUE in a prior rating decision.  See Board Decision, March 23, 2023.

In July 2023, the Veteran filed a new claim of entitlement to service connection for a skin disability of the bilateral hands, which was subsequently denied in an October 2023 rating decision.  See Rating Decision, October 2023.

The Veteran filed a supplemental claim for entitlement to service connection a skin disability of the bilateral hands again in October 2003, which was denied in a March 2024 rating decision.  VA received the Veteran's NOD for this determination later in March 2024.  See NOD, March 26, 2024.  In May 2024, the Board granted a claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hyperkeratosis.  The implementing rating decision assigned a noncompensable disability rating, effective from July 7, 2023.  See Rating Decision, May 15, 2024.  

Later in May 2024, the Veteran filed another supplemental claim, alleging entitlement to an effective date prior to July 7, 2023, for his skin disability of the bilateral hands, an effective date prior to July 28, 2016, for the grant of service connection for neuropathy of the bilateral upper extremities, and entitlement to an effective date prior to February 16, 1972, for the grant of service connection for ulcerative colitis.  See VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, May 25, 2024.  In September 2024, the AOJ denied these claims.  See Rating Decision, September 23, 2024.  VA received the Veteran's NOD for these claims in October 2024.  See VA Form 10182, October 19, 2024.  This is the rating decision currently before the Board.

A July 2024 rating decision continued the noncompensable disability rating assigned for the Veteran's skin disability of the bilateral hands.  See Rating Decision, July 17, 2024.  VA received the Veteran's NOD with this determination later in July 2024.  See NOD, July 30, 2024.  In November 2024, the Board denied this claim.  See Board Decision, November 7, 2024.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 16, 1972, for the grant of service connection for ulcerative colitis is denied.

In reviewing the entirety of the Veteran's claims file, to include all of the Fully Developed Claims and Supplemental Claims cited above, it remains unclear exactly what the Veteran and his agent allege with respect to his ulcerative colitis, except the repeated claim of entitlement to an effective date prior to February 16, 1972, for the grant of service connection.  

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an award of benefits is generally the date on which the claim that resulted in the award was filed. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 provides, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of a rating and award of compensation based on an initial claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 

The Veteran has already been assigned the earliest possible effective date for the grant of service connection for ulcerative colitis as a matter of law, which is the day following separation from active service, February 16, 1972.  Without further clarification of this claim, the Board must find there is no legal entitlement to an effective date prior to February 16, 1972.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2); Sabonis v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?426 (1994) (where the law is dispositive, the claim must be denied due to an absence of legal entitlement).

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 28, 2016, for the grant of service connection for neuropathy, LUE with hand arthralgia, is denied.

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 28, 2016, for the grant of service connection for neuropathy, RUE with hand arthralgia, is denied.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to effective dates prior to July 28, 2016, for the grant of service connection for bilateral neuropathy of the upper extremities as they were part and parcel of his original claim of entitlement to service connection for ulcerative colitis, received by VA in February 1972, under DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011) (holding the Secretary generally must investigate the reasonably apparent and potential causes of the Veteran's condition and theories of service connection that are reasonably raised by the record or raised by a sympathetic reading of the claimant's filing.)  Essentially, the Veteran claims that neuropathy of the upper extremities was reasonably raised by the record at the time of the February 1972 rating decision that granted entitlement to service connection for ulcerative colitis.

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an award of benefits is generally the date on which the claim that resulted in the award was filed. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 provides, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of a rating and award of compensation based on an initial claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 

The Veteran did not file a claim for upper extremity neuropathy with hand arthralgias in his 1972 claim. The Board has not been able to find any communication indicating an intent to apply for benefits based on a skin, arm, or hand disability. Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (holding that "a veteran's formal claim is required to identify the sickness, disease, or injuries for which compensation is sought, at least at a high level of generality"). Instead, the Veteran's February 1972 VA Form 21-526EZ, "Veteran's Application for Compensation or Pension at Separation from Service," contains references to enteritis and severe colitis, ulcerative or granulomatous (Box 6), and references mononucleosis, (Box 8C) and contusion of right kidney (Box 9C). 

In completing the form, the Veteran also referenced several specific additional documents. In particular, he mentioned treatment for enteritis and colitis on March 22, 1971, and April 28, 1971, and a Physical Evaluation Board on October 13, 1971 (Box 6). He also mentioned care from March 22 to 28, 1971, and January and February 1972 (Box 7B). For the mononucleosis he mentioned treatment in February 1968. For the kidney, he mentioned the same records and the date as February 4, 1969. 

On review of all these records, there is no reference to skin, musculoskeletal, or neurological problems of the upper extremities. 

The Veteran was also seen for a March 1972 VA examination in connection with his original claim. The examining physician listed "right kidney contusion, mononucleosis, colitis, regional enteritis" in the narrative history. The report also indicates that the Veteran reported "No problems that I am aware of from the kidney or mononucleosis. I am on a diet. I have numerous bowels movements daily and intermittent pain and diarrhea." On clinical examination, the skin, musculoskeletal and neurological portions were completed as "normal." 

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the February 1972 claim did not, even at a high level of generality, identify upper extremity neuropathy with hand arthralgias, nor was one discovered while developing the actually claimed disability. Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran did not file a claim for bilateral upper extremity skin, neuropathy, or arthralgias at that time. The Board turns to consider the next-in-time claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Here, on July 28, 2016, VA received the service connection claim for a bilateral hand condition, specifically a skin disorder above the wrists. This was the Veteran's initial application for benefits regarding any hand condition. Benefits have been awarded from July 28, 2016, the date on which VA received the initial claim that resulted in the award. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the AOJ correctly awarded benefits for neuropathy, RUE with hand arthralgia and neuropathy, LUE with hand arthralgia neuropathy from July 28, 2016, the date of receipt of the claim. There is an exception to the general rule which is provided in 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1) providing the effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran shall be the day following the date of discharge or the release, if application therefore is received within one year from such date of discharge or release. While, as discussed above, the Veteran filed an application for benefits in 1972, he only sought service connection for enteritis and colitis, not a hand condition. As such no claim for a hand condition could be inferred in 1972 claim. See DeLisio, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011). 

Further, a specific claim on the form prescribed by the VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by the VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). Prior to March 2015, a benefits claim could be accepted informally. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. The Board finds, however, even in consideration of this previous avenue to service connection, the record lacks any indication of an informal claim for service connection benefits related to a bilateral hand condition prior to July 2016.

Thus, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, an effective date prior to July 28, 2016, is not warranted and there is no doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Veteran and his representative also appear to allege entitlement to earlier effective dates prior to July 28, 2016, for the award of service connection for neuropathy of the bilateral upper extremities with hand arthralgia based upon CUE in a prior decision.  An assertion of CUE in a prior VA rating decision is a motion or a request, not a theory of entitlement that can be considered part of an appeal for an earlier effective date.  See, e.g., Hillyard v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 343, 355 (2011).  If the Veteran wishes to directly challenge whether there was CUE in the February 1972 rating decision, he may file a motion alleging CUE with the AOJ. See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 333 (2006).

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 7, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a skin disability of the bilateral hands, to include keratinization and hyperkeratosis, is denied.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to an effective date prior to July 7, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a skin disability of the hands under DeLisio, 25 Vet. App. 45. See VA From 10182, dated October 2024. It appears that he believes that an effective date for it should be the same as the effective date of the ulcerative colitis, namely February 16, 1972, not the assigned effective date of July 7, 2023. As will be discussed in more detail below, the Board finds no basis upon which to grant an effective date prior to July 7, 2023.

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an award of benefits is generally the date on which the claim that resulted in the award was filed. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 provides, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of a rating and award of compensation based on an initial claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 

Here, a May 2024 rating decision granted service connection for hyperkeratosis effective July 7, 2023, the date of filing of VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request - Supplemental Claim for a bilateral hand/skin condition and the May 2024 rating decision code sheet noted that original denial of the claim was on September 16, 2017. 

On July 28, 2016, VA received a claim of entitlement to service connection for "Bilateral hands skin disorders above wrists secondary to Agent Orange." Service connection for bilateral hand condition, skin, was denied in September 2017, a notice of disagreement with the denial was filed in September 2017 and a Statement of the Case (SOC) was issued in December 2017 that continued the denial; it recharacterized the issue as service connection for skin disorder, bilateral upper extremities as a result of exposure to herbicide agents. The Veteran appealed to the Board and a June 25, 2019; Board decision remanded the claim for service connection for "a bilateral hand skin condition" for further development. After further development, in January 2020, a Supplemental SOC (SSOC) continued the denial of service connection for a bilateral hand skin condition. The issue was returned to the Board and in March 2020, the issue was recharacterized as service connection for a skin disability and remanded again for further development. After further development, in March 2021, a SSOC was issued that continued the denial of service connection for a skin disability. The issue was then returned to the Board and in July 2021 the Board, based on Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) split the claim into 2 claims and denied a claim on the one issue characterized as service connection for a service connection for a skin condition of the bilateral hands and remanded the other claim for a bilateral hand condition. After further development, in October 2021, a SSOC was issued that denied service connection for a right and left right hand disorders to include as due to herbicide exposure. The issues were returned to the Board and, in December 2021, the Board, based on Clemons, supra., again recharacterized the claim as one for service connection for a nerve condition or pain, stiffness, numbness, and tingling of the hands (formerly claimed as a bilateral hand condition) and remanded it for further development. Thereafter, a February 2022 rating decision granted entitlement to neuropathy, RUE with hand arthralgia and neuropathy, LUE with hand arthralgia neuropathy, effective July 28, 2016. The Veteran never disagreed or appealed in relation to the denial of any issue with a bilateral hand/skin condition and the decision became final.

Over a year later, on July 7, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request - Supplemental Claims for a bilateral hand/skin condition and listed the date of the previous decision as June 30, 2023 (there is no decision on or about June 30, 2023). As noted above, that claim was adjudicated and granted and assigned the effective date of July 7, 2023, the date the Supplemental Claim was received by VA. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the Veteran was correctly awarded benefits for service connection for keratinization skin disorders with hyperkeratosis bilateral hands effective July 7, 2023, the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 

There is an exception to the general rule which is provided in 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1) providing the effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran shall be the day following the date of discharge or the release, if application therefore is received within one year from such date of discharge or release. While, as discussed above, the Veteran filed an application for benefits in 1972, he only sought service connection for enteritis and colitis, not a hand condition. As such no claim for a hand condition could be inferred in 1972 claim. See DeLisio, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011).

Further, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by the VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). Prior to March 2015, a benefits claim could be accepted informally. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. The Board finds, however, even in consideration of this previous avenue to service connection, the record lacks any indication of an informal claim for service connection benefits related to a bilateral hand condition or unadjudicated claim.

Thus, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, an effective date prior to July 7, 2023, is not warranted and there is no doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Board again notes that the Veteran and his representative also appear to allege entitlement to earlier effective dates prior to July 7, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a skin disability of the bilateral hands, based upon CUE in a prior rating decision.  An assertion of CUE in a prior VA rating decision is a motion or a request, not a theory of entitlement that can be considered part of an appeal for an earlier effective date.  See, e.g., Hillyard v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 343, 355 (2011).  If the Veteran wishes to directly challenge whether there was CUE in the February 1972 rating decision, he may file a motion alleging CUE with the AOJ. See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 333 (2006).
