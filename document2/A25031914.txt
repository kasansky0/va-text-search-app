REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from October 2017 to March 2022. This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from February 2024 and March 2024 rating decisions issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400 (a)(1). Here, the February and March 2024 rating decisions issued by the VA, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), were generated in response to claims for service connection filed by the Veteran. The February and March 2024 rating decisions constitute initial decisions, and the AMA applies.

The February 2024 rating decision on appeal denied service connection for disabilities of the shoulders, back, knees, and ankles. The Veteran's remaining claim for service connection for migraines was denied in the March 2024 rating decision. The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) on August 22, 2024 disagreeing with the denials of service connection. He elected to place his appeal on the Direct Review docket. As a valid and timely VA Form 10182 was received, the appeal is properly before the Board.

The Veteran elected to place this appeal on the Direct Review docket on the August 2024 VA Form 10182. Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 and March 2024 rating decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. In other words, the Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the AOJ issued the February and March 2024 rating decisions.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a migraine or headache disability.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability. 

3. Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability.

5. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability.

6. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability.

7. Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability.

8. Entitlement to service connection for a left ankle disability.

The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for migraines and disabilities of the shoulders, back, knees, and ankles as they were incurred due to injuries during active duty service.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have the disabilities claimed, and has not had the conditions at any time during the pendency of the claims or recent to the filing of the claims. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107 (b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a), (d). 

Service treatment records are negative for treatment or complaints related to the claimed migraine and joint disabilities. There is no indication of any related problems during service, and the Veteran's relevant systems were normal at an April 2020 separation examination. As service records are negative for complaints or findings related to the claimed conditions, the Board finds they do not contain sufficient evidence to indicate the current presence of the disabilities on appeal.

The post-service evidence also does not establish the presence of any of the claimed disabilities. The Veteran has not indicated he received VA or private medical treatment for the claimed conditions, nor has he provided any medical opinions in support of the claims. The Veteran was provided a VA examination for migraines in February 2024, but the examiner concluded the Veteran did not have a migraine or headache condition. The Veteran also did not describe any symptomatology related to a migraine or headache disability at the examination. 

The Board further observes there is no lay or medical evidence of functional impairment related to the Veteran's claimed disabilities. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir., 2018) (holding that the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110" refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability."). 

The Board has also considered the Veteran's general contentions; however, he has not provided any information regarding symptoms or impairment he currently experiences. In addition, the Veteran generally lacks the expertise to specifically diagnose himself with chronic disabilities. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002) (finding veteran competent to testify as to ringing in the ears (tinnitus); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, Note 4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

The Veteran is competent to describe the symptoms he experiences, but he has not provided any specific lay evidence in support of his claims. He has not provided a description of any current symptoms, identified any type of impairment, or indicated that a clinician has diagnosed the claimed disabilities. As such, the lay evidence is not sufficient to establish the presence of the claimed migraines, shoulder, back, knee, or ankle disabilities.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have the disabilities claimed and has not had the conditions at any time during the pendency of the claims or recent to the filing of the claims. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107 (b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a), (d). The claims for service connection are accordingly denied.

Finally, the Board acknowledges that Veteran's exposure to various hazards associated with his active duty service in South Korea and as a combat engineer. The Veteran therefore engaged in toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) during active service, and, in accordance with the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), a disability examination and medical opinion must be obtained unless certain exceptions apply. The PACT Act requires the completion of a TERA examination "when there is evidence of a disability" and evidence of participation in a TERA. 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a). 

In this case, the Veteran was provided a TERA-related VA examination in February 2024 in accordance with the PACT Act. The examiner concluded in the accompanying medical opinion report that the Veteran did not have any pathology to warrant a diagnosis of the claimed migraine or headache condition. Regarding the the other disabilities on appeal, as discussed above, there is no competent evidence the Veteran has the disabilities claimed. The Board therefore finds that remand for TERA examinations and opinions is not required as there is no evidence of the disabilities claimed.
