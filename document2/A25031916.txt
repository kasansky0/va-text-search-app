ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left ear hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran does not have right ear hearing loss for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation purposes.  

2. For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's hearing loss was manifested by no worse than Level I in his right ear and no worse than Level II in his left ear.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for right ear hearing loss have not been met.  38?U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.385. 

2. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's left ear hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.21, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this appeal, served on active duty from January 1981 to January 1985.  

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a July 2023 decision.  In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2023 decision.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. §?3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Preliminary Matter

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

Hearing Loss

Applicable Laws and Regulations

The Veteran's hearing loss is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.  This diagnostic code sets out the criteria for evaluating hearing impairment using puretone threshold averages and speech discrimination scores.  Numeric designations are assigned based upon a mechanical use of tables found in 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, and there is no room for subjective interpretation.  See Acevedo-Escobar v. West, 12 Vet. App. 9, 10 (1998); Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992).  Examinations for hearing impairment for VA purposes must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a puretone audiometry test without the use of hearing aids.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85(a).  Speech recognition ability must be measured using the Maryland CNC word list.  Id.

Hearing loss disability evaluations range from noncompensable (zero) to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity, as measured by controlled speech discrimination tests in conjunction with the average hearing threshold, and as measured by puretone audiometric tests in the frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second, or hertz (Hz).

The rating criteria for hearing loss establish eleven auditory acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity, through Level XI for profound deafness.  The rows in Table VI (38 C.F.R. § 4.85) represent nine categories of the percentage of discrimination based on the controlled speech discrimination test.  The columns in Table VI represent nine categories of decibel loss based on the puretone audiometry test.  The numeric designation of impaired hearing (Levels I through XI) is determined for each ear by intersecting the row appropriate for the percentage of discrimination and the column appropriate to the puretone decibel loss.  The percentage disability evaluation is found in Table VII (38 C.F.R. § 4.85) by intersecting the row appropriate for the numeric designation for the ear having the better hearing acuity and the column appropriate to the numeric designation level for the ear having the poorer hearing acuity.

In addition, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a), when the puretone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, is 55 decibels or more, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b), when the puretone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  That numeral will then be elevated to the next higher Roman numeral.

In rendering a decision on the appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or?unpersuasive and?provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994).  Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.

A lay person is competent to report on the onset and reoccurrence of current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  The Board must determine, on a?case-by-case?basis, whether a veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 438 (2011); see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance, with a claimant prevailing in either event.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (2021); Ortiz?v.?Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

The claimant bears the burden of presenting and supporting a claim for benefits.  See Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

1. Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss in the right ear.

The Veteran contends that his hearing loss is due to his exposure to extreme noise while working as a boiler technician for the Navy.  See May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Veteran further contends that he was exposed to military noise from jet engines and turbine engines.  See June 2023 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).  

In denying the claim for service connection for hearing loss in the Veteran's right ear, the July 2023 rating decision identified the following favorable findings: 1. The Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded due to his exposure to Asbestos, fuel - Benzene and chemicals due to his job duties as a Boiler Technician; 2. Noise exposure has been conceded due to the Veteran's rating of Boiler Technician, which has a high probability for noise exposure; and 3. A nexus, or link, has been established between the Veteran's claimed issue and an in-service event based on the June 2023 VA examiner opining that the Veteran's hearing loss in his right ear is at least as likely as not caused by his in-service military noise exposure.  Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 U.S.C. § 5104A; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38?U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1)?a current disability; (2)?in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166 -67.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328 (1997); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). 

For the purposes of applying laws administered by the VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 or 4000 Hz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. §?3.385.

The Veteran was afforded a VA hearing loss examination in June 2023.  The examiner determined that, while the Veteran experienced subjective symptoms of hearing loss, the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of right ear hearing loss for VA purposes.  Puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

	? 	? 	HERTZ 	? 	? 

? 	500 	1000 	2000 	3000 	4000 

RIGHT 	15? 	15 	20	20 	35 

LEFT 	5 	20	15 	20 	55

Puretone average was 23 decibels in the right ear, and speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent. 

The Veteran's right ear hearing loss does not rise to the level of a disability for VA purposes, as the auditory threshold in each of the tested frequencies does not exceed 40 decibels, nor are the auditory thresholds for at least three of the tested frequencies measured at 26 decibels or greater.  38 C.F.R. §?3.385.  Further, the Veteran's speech recognition score using the Maryland CNC Test is not less than 94 percent.  Id.  Therefore, the first element for service connection, a current disability, is not met.  See Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166 -67.

The Board has considered the Veteran's assertion that he has hearing loss.  See May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  While lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, this specific issue falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  Although the Veteran is competent to report diminished hearing, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis of hearing loss for VA purposes.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 & n.4.  The issue is medically complex and requires specialized medical training and expertise to interpret results of audiological testing.  See King v. Shineski, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  Thus, the Board finds the medical evidence of record, including the June 2023 VA examination relaying audiometric and speech recognition testing results, is of greater probative value than the Veteran's lay statements. 

The Board concludes that the Veteran has not had right ear hearing loss for VA purposes at any time during the pendency of this claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26?Vet. App.?289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?319, 321 (2007).

Where the evidence does not support a finding of a current disability upon which to predicate a grant of service connection, there can be?no?valid claim for that benefit.  See Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225. 

Because the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claim for service connection for right ear hearing loss is therefore denied.

Should the Veteran's hearing acuity worsen over time, or if the Veteran believes his hearing has gotten worse since his June 2023 examination, the Veteran is encouraged to file a supplemental claim for service connection for hearing loss in his right ear. 

The Board observes that the Veteran contends that he has tinnitus in both ears.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182.  While the Veteran is competent to report the presence of ringing in his ears, the Board cannot consider that claim, as the Veteran has not filed a claim for tinnitus, nor has a claim for tinnitus been adjudicated in the first instance by the AOJ.  Thus, service connection for tinnitus is not before the Board.  

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin,?28?Vet. App.?366, 69-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).   

Accordingly, the appeal is denied.  

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected left ear hearing loss.  

Increased Ratings

Applicable Laws and Regulations

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of, or incident to, military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §?4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability evaluations.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, evaluation of the medical evidence since the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of a "staged rating" (assignment of different ratings for distinct periods of time, based on the facts found) is required.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

Analysis

The Veteran was granted service connection for his left ear hearing loss in a July 2023 rating decision, and the AOJ assigned a noncompensable rating effective April 20, 2023.  The Veteran seeks a higher rating.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182.  After a review of all the evidence, the Board finds that the record does not support an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's left ear hearing loss.

A June 2023 VA audiological examination reflects puretone thresholds of 20, 15, 20, and 55 decibels in the left ear at the test frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, respectively, with an average puretone threshold of 27.5 in the left ear (which the Board rounds up to 28 decibels).  The Maryland CNC speech recognition score is 88 percent in the left ear.  Using Table VI, the hearing impairment is Level II in the left ear.  Further, the Veteran's non-service-connected right ear is assigned a Level I for the purposes of determining the percentage evaluation of hearing loss in the left ear under Table VII.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85(f). 

 

By intersecting the row appropriate for Level I for the ear having the better hearing acuity, here the right ear, and the column appropriate for Level II for the ear having the poorer hearing acuity, which here is the left ear, a zero percent, or noncompensable, disability evaluation results under Table VII.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

The Board has considered the Veteran's statements that his left ear hearing loss warrants a higher rating.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182.  He is competent to report difficulty with hearing; however, he is not competent to report that his hearing acuity is of sufficient severity to warrant increased compensation under VA's tables for rating hearing loss because such an opinion requires medical expertise (training in evaluating hearing impairment), which he has not been shown to have.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  In determining the actual degree of his hearing disability, an objective examination that specifically measures relevant criteria of decibel loss at specific ranges and loss of speech recognition ability is more probative of the degree of the hearing loss impairment than general assertions of difficulty hearing.

Moreover, the description of his hearing loss must be considered in conjunction with the clinical evidence of record as well as the pertinent rating criteria.  In this regard, the Board emphasizes that disability ratings are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule.  Lendenmann, 3 Vet. App. 349.  Thus, the Board has no discretion in this matter and must base its determination on the results of the audiology study of record.

In Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447, 455-56 (2007), the Court held that, relevant to VA audiological examinations, in addition to dictating objective test results, a VA audiologist must fully describe the functional effects caused by a hearing disability in his or her final report.  The Court also noted, however, that even if an audiologist's description of the functional effects of a veteran's hearing disability was somehow defective, the veteran bore the burden of demonstrating any prejudice caused by a deficiency in the examination.

In this case, the June 2023 VA examiner addressed the functional effects of the Veteran's hearing loss by indicating that the Veteran has difficulty understanding in most listening situations.  Therefore, the functional effects of his hearing loss disability are adequately addressed in the record.  

For these reasons, the Board finds that an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's left ear hearing loss is not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

Should the Veteran's hearing acuity worsen over time, or if the Veteran believes his hearing has worsened since his June 2023 examination, the Veteran is encouraged to file a supplemental claim.    

The Board has also considered whether entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is raised by the record.? See Rice?v. Shinseki,?22?Vet. App.?447?(2009).? Here, the June 2023 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's hearing loss impacted his ability to work in that the Veteran reports difficulty understanding in most listening situations.? See June 2023 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus DBQ.? The Veteran, however, has not contended that he is unable to work due to his service-connected hearing loss in his left ear.? 38 C.F.R. §?4.16?(a).? There is no evidence of record that the Veteran is not working due to his left ear hearing loss.??? 

To the extent that his service-connected?left ear hearing loss disability does affect his ability?to perform some?work tasks, the schedular?rating?assigned for his service-connected?disability contemplates the symptoms shown and compensates him for such impairment.? Indeed,?disability?ratings?are intended to compensate impairment in earning capacity due to service-connected?disability.? 38 U.S.C. § 1155,?38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.15; see also Van Hoose v. Brown, 4?Vet. App.?361, 363 (1993) (noting that the?disability?rating?itself is recognition that industrial capabilities are impaired; the record must reflect some factor which takes the case outside the norm).??? 

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette, 28 Vet. App. at 69-70.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
