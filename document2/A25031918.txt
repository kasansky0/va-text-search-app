ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective for the grant of service connection for a lung disability based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a March 1995 rating decision is denied.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for a lumbar spine disability based on CUE in a March 1995 rating decision is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for a lung disability and lumbar spine disability were denied in a March 1995 rating decision that became final because he did not submit a notice of disagreement or new and material evidence within the appeal period. 

2. The correct facts, as known at the time, were before the VA adjudicators in March 1995.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to revision of a March 1995 rating decision that denied service connection for a lung disability, on the basis of CUE pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105, have not been satisfied. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a).

2. The criteria for entitlement to revision of a March 1995 rating decision that denied service connection for a lumbar spine disability, on the basis of CUE pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105, have not been satisfied. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from September 1986 to September 1994.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2021 ; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the April 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. 

However, new evidence has not been considered in this decision regarding the claim for revision of the March 1995, rating decision based on CUE, because CUE decisions must be based upon the facts and law that existed at the time of the prior decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301; but see 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a)(1)(iii).

While the Board has an obligation to read pro se filings liberally, this obligation does not extend to filings by counsel, as is the case here. See Andrews v. Nicholson, 421 F.3d 1278, 1283-84 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Thus, the Board will only address herein the arguments explicitly raised by the appellant's attorney in the March 2021 CUE motion.

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective for the grant of service connection for a lung disability based on CUE in a March 1995 rating decision.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for a lumbar spine disability based on CUE in a March 1995 rating decision.

The Veteran asserts that there is CUE in the March 1995 rating decision that denied service connection for a lung and spine disability. 

A previous RO determination that is final and binding will be accepted as correct in the absence of CUE. Where evidence establishes such error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a). Here, a March 1995 rating action denied entitlement to service connection for joint pain, muscle cramps, and lung problems, as well as service connection for a back condition, and the Veteran did not file a timely Notice of Disagreement challenging this determination, nor did he submit new evidence and material evidence within one year of its promulgation. Thus, the March 1995 rating decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.160(d), 3.156(b), 20.302, 20.1103.   

Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of CUE. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105. CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error." It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE. Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error." Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993). In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different. Id. at 44. 

Where evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a). For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision. Id. 

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated"; and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time that decision was rendered. Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992). 

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision. See Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233, 235-36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999). A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset. King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014). The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different. Id. at 442. 

The benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application in claims of CUE. Andrews v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 177, 186 (2004) (citing Russell, 3 Vet. App. at 313) (it is well established that the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine can never be applicable in assessing a CUE motion because the nature of such a motion is that it involves more than a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated). 

As a threshold matter, the Board finds that the arguments advanced by the Veteran allege CUE with the requisite specificity. See Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003). The Board will therefore adjudicate the merits of his claims. 

In this case, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526, Veteran's Application for Compensation or Pension, received by VA in September 1994. Therein, the Veteran relevantly sought service connection for joint pain, muscle pain, and lung problems. 

Evidence at the time of the March 1995 rating decision that adjudicated the September 1994 claims included the Veteran's service treatment records, which show a complaint of lower back pain. However, there was no indication of any lung disability.

Upon VA examination in October 1994 the Veteran was noted to have a diagnosis of record of lung problems as well as complaints of difficulty in breathing, which is mainly through the nose from sinus condition and not a lung problem. Examination showed clear lungs and normal range of motion for the neck, back, upper and lower extremities. The Veteran was diagnosed with recurrent mild strains of the right shoulder, both knees, and both lower legs. 

In March 1995 the RO denied the Veteran's claim for a lung disability on the basis that the evidence did not show a basis of incurrence of lung problems within the presumptive period or on a direct basis. The RO denied the claim for a back disability on the basis that the Veteran's back pain identified in service was acute and transitory and healed with no permanent residuals shown on VA examination. 

The Veteran did not file a timely notice of disagreement challenging this determination, and no new and material evidence was received within one year of the March 1995 RO decision, nor were new, relevant service records received at any time thereafter. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (b) and 3.156(c). Consequently, the March 1995 rating decision became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104 (a), 3.160(d), 3.156(b), 20.302, 20.1103.

The Veteran's argument in March 2021 is that the RO erred in stating that the evidence was negative for treatment of findings related to a lung condition and that no clinical findings supported the condition. The Veteran points to the order for a VA examination in 1994 that indicated "lung problems" and the report of examination dated in 1994 that identified a diagnosis of lung problems and reported the Veteran's complaints of difficulty breathing. 

The Veteran's argument in March 2021 regarding the back was that the RO erred in stating that there were only two isolated incidents of back injury and thus the back injury was acute and transitory and healed with no permanent residuals.

The Board notes that the RO considered this information in the rating decision challenged, specifically identifying the October 1994 examination report. 

Importantly, the Veteran's arguments are essentially disagreements as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated by the adjudicator. However, "[i]t is the prerogative of the factfinder . . . to interpret the evidence and draw reasonable inferences from it."  Evans, 27 Vet. App. at 187 (citing Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 52 (1990)). Notably, it is clear that the adjudicator found that the evidence was negative for treatment of findings relating to a lung condition, and that the Veteran did not have a chronic back disability related to his active service. A disagreement as to how the facts were weighed does not support a finding of CUE. Fugo, 6 Vet. App. at 43-44. Therefore, revision or reversal of the March 1995 rating decision on the basis of CUE is denied. 

In the alternative, the Veteran's representative argues that the Veteran's claims for lung disability and back disability remained unadjudicated since a prior claim. Specifically, the Veteran contends that the claims were pending pursuant to deferred rating decisions issued in August 1996 and October 1996. The Board notes that in the VA Form 10182 the Veteran's representative solely appealed the decisions dated in March 2021 and March 1995 and indicated that the area of dispute was CUE. Therefore, the Board limits its consideration to the CUE argument.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c).

Review of the claims file shows that there are deferred rating decisions dated in August 1996 and October 1996. The Veteran was sent a notice in August 1996 requesting additional information. An examination order form dated in September 1996 indicates that the Veteran was claiming service connection for shortness of breath and for joint pains, knees, shoulders, and shins. In the October 1996 deferred rating decision, it was marked that jurisdiction was denied. 

In February 2001 the Veteran was notified that no further action will be taken until the Veteran informs the VA of his willingness to report for examination. The notice was sent to the Veteran's address then of record, which is the same address as the Veteran notified VA in March 2001. In the statement dated March 2001, the Veteran stated "I am more than willing to do what I need to stay in good standings with the V.A." 

An intent to file a claim for benefits was received in January 2018. There is no indication of a claim for benefits completed within one year thereafter.

In February 2020 the Veteran submitted claims for a back disability and COPD. The claim for a back disability was denied in a rating decision dated in February 2020.

In a December 2020 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for COPD, previously rated as lung problems, and granted entitlement to an evaluation of 100 percent, effective August 21, 2020.

In a January 2021 rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, with an evaluation of 50 percent disabling from April 30, 2020, to August 21, 2020. The Veteran was also granted entitlement to a 100 percent evaluation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease beginning August 21, 2020.

The Board finds that there is no unadjudicated claim for benefits remaining from deferred rating decisions issued in August and October 1996. As noted above, after additional action, in February 2001 the Veteran was notified that additional action would not be taken. The Veteran did not appeal or otherwise dispute this finding. In addition, the Veteran did not report that he was willing to attend an examination. The Board acknowledges that in March 2001 the Veteran indicated that he was willing to do what was necessary to stay in good standing with VA. However, the statement was in regard to his move from one state to another and does not state that he has any additional claim or that he wished to attend a VA examination.

In addition, subsequent to the current appeal, the record indicates that service connection for the Veteran's COPD, previously claimed as lung problems, as due to undiagnosed illness, with obstructive sleep apnea due to rhinitis, has been in effect since February 1994. Lastly, subsequent to the current appeal, the Veteran has been granted an effective date in February 2020 for service connection for a back disability. As this represents the claim date subsequent to the final prior decisions, an earlier effective date is not available. See Rating Decision December 2023.

As there was no pending, unadjudicated claim for benefits dated in 1996, there is no grounds for revision of the subsequent effective dates granted based upon this argument.
